0,J.I.D,DiCaprio 2,Rap,7.7,December 12 2018,Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,"Four tracks into DiCaprio 2,  J. Cole, shows up for a feature. Typically, on these sort of master-student collaborations, the less-experienced rapper’s strain is audible as he attempts to show he can hang. Here, it’s the opposite: J.I.D’s opening verse is so gleeful, so effortless and so fast, that when it comes Cole’s turn to rap, you can almost hear him brace for impact. Cole gets off a strong verse, and the song, “Off Deez,” is one of many standouts here. But you can just imagine them stepping out of booth, J.I.D pumped and ready for more; Cole relieved that he can still rap as well as his younger signee. J.I.D’s confidence comes from years of work. Finally starting to get his due at the age of 28, Destin Route built up a head of steam in the old-fashioned way (circa 2007, or B.I.G., Before Instagram), releasing mixtape after mixtape until he turned heads with the first DiCaprio project, an EP released at the top of 2015. He signed with Cole’s label, Dreamville, in 2017 and his debut album, The Never Story, was released in March and converted rap fans all year mostly off the strength of the rapper’s technical ability and the delight that he takes in displaying it. That ability has been refined further on DiCaprio 2, but J.I.D’s second album has more to offer than simple rapping chops. Let’s talk about those for a second though. J.I.D’s hyper-enunciated, high-pitched whine of a flow is initially reminiscent of Kendrick Lamar’s, but that comparison feels narrow. (He plays with the connection explicitly on “Despacito Too,” interpolating Kendrick lyrics in a narrative about his own individual development.) J.I.D’s melodic instincts are strong, sharing ties with Isaiah Rashad and even, occasionally, Bone Thugs, and he has the ability to get jokes off even in the midst of triple-time rapping, a la Big L or Lil Wayne. Though he can rap faster than almost any newcomer in recent memory, he uses the speed as one of several tools and his flow is chameleonic, suited to the given moment. (His pen name comes from his grandma’s chosen adjective for him, “jittery,” and it’s the right word for this restless rapper.) And then, of course, there are little lyrical gems. The best lines here feel like J.I.D is performing acrobatics on a 20-foot tightrope; many of his lyrics operate on the basis of his speed jousting with listener's expectations and making his songs surprising and relistenable. A bizarre line zips by in “Westbrook,” an A$AP Ferg feature, “Live life like a baby that was dead at birth but came alive and fucked the nurses,” the deadpan absurdity hitting your ears so quickly that you want to hear it again, just to confirm that he really said it. He also makes great use of little switchbacks; on “Off Da Zoinkys,” an anti-drug anthem, he thanks Ronald Reagan (ostensibly for the War on Drugs) and as you’re gearing up to react, he immediately takes it back, calling the 40th president “racist as fuck.” “Off Da Zoinky’s” gives a window into J.I.D’s appeal. Given that it’s an anti-drug sermon of sorts, it could easily have been sanctimonious. Instead, it’s self-aware (“I ain’t nosy but I know what I know, Mr. Know-It-All, oh here he go”) and it builds over time. J.I.D. eventually says that the reason he stays drug-free is that he wants his mind clear and his focus sharp because he’s trying to be the greatest. That higher purpose gives the song more in common with Andre 3000 on “ATLiens” (”No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day”) than with J. Cole’s album-long campaign against sin, KOD. DiCaprio 2’s lyrical showcase takes a turn on “Workin’ Out,” and across the remainder of the album, J.I.D tries different things, usually successfully. (The clear exception is “Skrawberries,” a thick-headed treatise on gender relations that wastes a Mac Miller beat and comes complete with the line “[she] got a couple abortions, now that pussy’s a haunted house.”) “Tiiied,” a song about relationship drama, opens on J.I.D fighting with his girl at the movies sounding a little like Anderson .Paak with a fine eye for detail. The song is produced by Dreamville’s Elite and Ron Gilmore and it’s filled with jazzy musical flourishes that, like many of the beats here, catch your ear anew once you’ve become familiar with the verses. But the strongest song on the album’s back half is “Hot Box,” as J.I.D works out his New York fetishism with a head-turning guest verse from Method Man and some lovely neo-boom bap courtesy of Skhye Hutch (who’s produced for Ab-Soul and Kendrick) and Zorro. J.I.D’s presence on Dreamville makes all kinds of sense. He shares Cole’s values and the priorities and pleasures of his music are those of an older generation. On the late-album standout “Just Da Other Day,” he says “I’m tryna get my fuckin goals, not a goyard,” and his anti-materialist outlook and low-key contempt for his contemporaries tracks perfectly with his label boss. But nothing about J.I.D is crochety or bitter. His songs are about joy and hunger and reflection and fun. Not one of them feels as if it’s trying to save hip-hop.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jid-dicaprio-2/,"Dreamville,Interscope",2018.0
1,Black Sabbath,Paranoid,"Metal,Rock",9.5,December 9 2018,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"From a moonlit thicket, a soldier wielding a scimitar and a pointy shield approaches, his eyes bulging with terror beneath a bright white helmet. He wears pink leggings and an outlandish orange blazer, an outfit that becomes, in Marcus Keef’s clumsy long-exposure photograph, a garish streak of glowing neon across the midnight scene. These were meant to be “War Pigs,” autocratic henchmen Black Sabbath lampooned during their second album’s bellicose opener and its intended title. From a distance, they look like an errant splotch of paint across a sheet of construction paper; up close, they just look absurd. Still, in all its grainy ignominy, Paranoid’s cover is one of the most transformative moments in the early history of Black Sabbath and, by extension, heavy metal. In 1970, Black Sabbath’s self-titled debut did something few were expecting—it sold very well, charting both at their home in the UK and in the United States. Their label, Vertigo, soon dispatched Black Sabbath back to the studio to record a follow-up, stretching their already-indulgent impulses into eight-minute songs about war and heroin and the glory of the guitar. When they needed one more tune, the band headed to the bar while guitarist Tony Iommi stayed behind and spent a few minutes writing a simple riff that chugged, paused, and kept prowling, like a predator always in search of its next meal. They recorded the song in a flash and called it “Paranoid,” the fulfillment of a legal obligation. Vertigo didn’t hear filler; it heard a hit, a trouncing three-minute assault by a young band that still favored excessive jams. Six months after releasing Black Sabbath, they issued the song as Black Sabbath’s second single and demanded that the album’s title be changed from War Pigs to Paranoid. They wanted to remind potential customers of the song they’d seen four long-haired weirdos headbang to on “Top of the Pops” while avoiding the nasty business of saying something controversial in an era already fraught with civil unrest. But in the sprint to get the record into stores, Vertigo never bothered to commission an image that fit the new name. The soldier simply stands there, an embarrassment in neon. After nearly 50 years, bassist and songwriter Geezer Butler (and most everyone else) still hates it: “The cover was bad enough when the album was going to be War Pigs, but when it was Paranoid it didn’t even make sense.” The label was right about “Paranoid,” at least. Propelled by its lead single, Paranoid was the only Black Sabbath album to top the British charts for the next four decades. In the U.S., where it nearly broke into the Top 10 mere months after the band’s small stateside debut, it has gone platinum four times. Record labels realized that heaviness and spookiness could sell and that Led Zeppelin, Sabbath’s favorite band, were just the beginning. In ceding to Vertigo’s commercial instincts about “Paranoid,” both as a single and album title, Black Sabbath helped launch heavy metal not just as a genre but also as a veritable industry. But “Paranoid” itself foregrounds an adolescent sort of worry—about being depressed and not understanding the symptoms or root of it, about crying when others laugh, about breaking up with someone because “she couldn’t help me with my mind.” At the heart of Paranoid, however, are very adult concerns about the raging war in Vietnam, the button-push annihilation of atomic weapons, and the oligarchic structures that suppressed the working class in the band’s benighted hometown of Birmingham and beyond. Paranoid is rightly seen as an essential metal template, but it should also be seen as an essential document of its time and place. Despite the pugnacious sound (“the new standard in power rock,” one early advertisement called it) and macabre promotional images of these proto-heshers stalking churchyards and cemeteries, it is a reflection of a troubled globe teetering on the brink of another world war or even a nuclear apocalypse, made by four blue-collar kids from a tough city. Those who worry about end times are ignored, while those who do the government’s dirty work are born to suffer. These are laments for a world gone wrong, coupled with calls to battle back and fix it. Still, for decades, that’s not what the critics heard: In his 1971 review for Rolling Stone, Nick Tosches conjured Satanic clichés and misogynist Manson family jokes before mistaking Black Sabbath for their peers in Black Widow, anyway. The same year, The Washington Post wondered, “Your choice: Is the worst rock band Grand Funk Railroad or Black Sabbath? It’s getting harder and harder to decide.” As late as 1997, Rolling Stone still insisted it was “a campy farce … lumbering, obnoxious, and a total gas.” Had the album been called War Pigs a year after Altamont and months after Kent State, though, would critics have heard it differently? Would they have understood that, even if it sounded like spooky fantasy, this steely strain of rock could address real-world worries—and would even do so for the next half-century? Of course, Paranoid’s high sales and wide reach, not this critical repudiation, made it heavy metal’s chrysalis. You can point to any of the eight songs here as the partial inspiration for an entire subgenre of metal or rock at large, each prompting decades of creative exegesis. More than the eponymous anthem that began their debut, the drifting verses of “Hand of Doom” are direct arrows into, well, doom metal, turbocharged by sections that feel like nebulous hardcore. The italicized pummel of “Paranoid” itself is the link between Zeppelin and thrash. The starts and stops of “Rat Salad,” and the way Iommi’s guitar line runs like razor wire between the rhythmic shifts, presage the instrumental ecstasy of math-rock, in spirit if not in skill. The beginning of “Fairies Wear Boots” keeps folding and rising, only to empty into declarative verses, like the skeleton of power metal awaiting eventual flesh. Ozzy Osbourne, his voice routed through a whirling Leslie speaker, delivers images of romantic escapism over circular bass and hand-drum patter during “Planet Caravan”—alongside electric Miles, a clear antecedent for metal’s exploratory psychedelic side. These eight songs have become scripture because they are breathless explorations of possibilities, unfettered by expectations or half a century of heavy metal history. Paranoid, after all, captures Black Sabbath at a moment when the future must have seemed suddenly tantalizing and limitless. The humble adolescent vision of making a living through anything other than going to war or going to the factory were suddenly within reach, if only for a spell. Iommi, Osbourne, Butler, and drummer Bill Ward had nothing to lose now except hard jobs. They write, sing, and play with the zeal of liberation, the incandescence of potential. During World War II, Axis bombs had splintered Birmingham, stripping the city of its economic engines and making existence odious for decades to come. In the 1960s, Birmingham suffered spates of anti-immigrant racism, desolate storefronts, and miserably cramped living conditions. The Brummies of Black Sabbath were the sons of factory laborers and office cleaners, shopkeepers and strict Catholics. When he was a teenager, Osbourne worked in an abattoir and went to prison for burglary; Iommi lost the tips of two fingers on his last day at a sheet metal factory and made his own prosthetics so he could play guitar. At home, they had seen stabbings and street brawls. “It had constant steam and smoke,” Ward remembers of the city and the way it shaped Sabbath’s sound, “so it has a very drab-looking landscape.” A career in rock’n’roll was not only a way out of Birmingham but a way to circumvent this cruel industrial order. The most terrifying thing about Black Sabbath in 1970 shouldn’t have been the ostentatious chrome cross strung around Iommi’s neck, Osbourne’s hand tattoos, or the talk of evil and witches and Lovecraftian horror. It should have been that here were four kids from the lower ranks of bombed-out Birmingham’s society, gaining a popular foothold by openly hoping the ruling class would fall to their knees and beg for mercy beneath the blows. “Day of judgment/God is calling,” Osbourne sings in the immortal opener, triumphantly stretching the syllables until he’s almost out of breath. “On their knees, the War Pigs crawling/Begging mercy for their sins.” In this scene, God and Satan provide the same salvation—the sweet deliverance of overdue vengeance. Black Sabbath spend the next three minutes dancing on the graves of the self-proclaimed mighty, Iommi’s guitar curling upward into an infinite grin. “We wrote ‘War Pigs’ because many American bands were frightened to mention anything about the war,” Butler later said. “So we thought we’d tell it like it is.” Though Osbourne has insisted that the band knew little about Vietnam, Butler says he paid closer attention to the war than most Americans did, in part because he feared Britain would join. Osbourne even calls the war by name during the second verse of “Hand of Doom.” The song became infamous as a supposed endorsement of heroin, but it’s a warning for deployed soldiers taken with the newfound hobby of trying to kill time with drugs but only killing themselves. At the end, Osbourne pushes his voice to its early falsetto limits, sharing the pain of the prescription: “Price of life is high/Now you’re going to die.” Despite the indignation for the soldier’s bad choice, there’s a strong sense of pity here for the “fools” following orders, the real judgement reserved for the leaders who have put their people in this position. It’s the hand of invisible doom, of a free market at war with its own citizens. The members of Black Sabbath had been born in the wake of World War II, some even the sons of veterans. They had lived much of their lives surrounded by its fallout, the Cold War, and were teenagers during the Cuban Missile Crisis, an existential flashpoint about whether we valued pride more than survival. They began to play music together just as the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia and just as the Cold War began to spill into more territories. Anchored by a hangman riff and guided by Osbourne’s best sorcerer vocals, “Electric Funeral” lashes out at the woe of that atomic age and the endless destruction it enables. The song feels entirely uneasy, wobbling at the lip of a future where “Rivers turn to mud/Eyes melt into blood.” Perhaps that’s what the deathless “Iron Man” has seen in his intergalactic voyage. Though the song has nothing to do with the Marvel comic of the same name, it is a surreal fantasy. A man has been shot into space to look backward at Earth’s future (that’s how time travel works, right?) and share some insight on how to make it better. He sees disaster, but the journey back through the atmosphere renders him mute, unable to share the dire truth. He’s ostracized and ignored until he lashes out, iron fists falling on the city with the weight of Iommi’s monstrous riff and Ward’s colossal Bonham drums. Black Sabbath again delight in revolt, from the relish in Osbourne’s voice as he sings “Now he has his revenge” to Iommi and Butler’s hyperkinetic score for the imagined fight scene. The sense that these kids are almost always looking for a brawl during Paranoid comes to fruition at the end. According to band lore, the long-haired, heavy-drinking members of Sabbath encountered a crew of skinheads sporting boots after an early gig, as they often did. These weren’t the skinheads of the neo-Nazi variety; this was just a different set of working-class youth with alternate values and fashion choices, making for an S.E. Hinton-styled clash of subcultures. They fought, and Sabbath won. On what’s thankfully the only song he penned here, Osbourne immortalized the victory by calling the skinheads fairies, which had become a vogue insult for an image of gay men before World War II. Sure, “Fairies Wear Boots” boasts one of the best grooves of Sabbath’s entire discography, some of Osbourne’s most effortlessly soulful singing ever, and a bridge and solo that feel every bit as triumphant as their alleged victory that night. But it plays up the budding egos of 20-somethings from a rough town now on the verge of rock’n’roll stardom with a lazy insult, an early flash of the machismo that would become hard rock’s lifeblood during the next decade. Youth is the perfect fuel for most of Paranoid; here, it is the puerile folly, getting the best of Black Sabbath’s armed hippie vision. But Paranoid began to make stars of Black Sabbath, and the music of the boys from Birmingham reflected that almost instantly. Butler once (suspiciously) insisted that, during the salad days of their first two albums, they couldn’t even afford cheap booze, let alone a lot of weed; a year later, Master of Reality launches stoner metal with its first track, “Sweet Leaf.” The next seven years with Osbourne hinged largely on songs about feeling low on breakups, high on cocaine, irritated at the record label, and irate at one another. Political songs didn’t entirely disappear from Black Sabbath’s catalog, but they did become more sporadic and ham-fisted. A year later, on Master of Reality, the bracing and relentless “Children of the Grave” offered a rallying cry for the kids, as society’s supposed heavy metal boogeymen urged the kids to organize and “show the world that love is still alive.” There is an odd rendering of an Orwellian world on 1973’s Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and, improbably, a very bad piece of political theater about a cross-dressing woman who becomes president of the United States on 1976’s sleek and largely miserable Technical Ecstasy. What’s worse, a thread of class condescension began to ripple through Black Sabbath’s songs, too, criticizing the commoners and their inability to just cut free of society, to get wild. By then, Black Sabbath played from the pedestal of fame, not from the pit of Birmingham turmoil that had made Paranoid so timely and vivid. And slowly, the élan at work during Paranoid began to fade, too. The band made records because it was now a career. At the start of the millennium, the original Black Sabbath quartet that created Paranoid and a map for heavy metal to come reunited in the studio alongside Rick Rubin. It took a decade and Ward’s acrimonious departure, but they eventually finished 13, their final album and first with Osbourne since their initial eight-album volley ended in 1978. In the interim, Black Sabbath had become a microcosm of behind-the-music melodrama, with Osbourne and Iommi infamously spending the better part of their adult lives trying to one-up each other by searching for a better singer or guitarist. There were reality shows, patrician lifestyles, and, presumably, more money than Satan. In those sessions, Iommi later said, they wanted to recapture the essence of Paranoid—four kids locked in a room, letting off existential unease by plowing through tunes about everything that has gone wrong in the world. The best songs on 13 excoriate wicked demagogues and fret over the Earth’s precarious existence, like the best of Paranoid. The plan worked, intentionally harnessing some of the accidental urgency that helped make Black Sabbath famous 40 years earlier and shaping a reunion album better than anyone had a reason to expect. That is the strange power and sad relevance of Paranoid, a record whose technophobe fears and atomic anxieties are as salient in this age of brash politicians and international blunder as they were in that one.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-sabbath-paranoid/,"Vertigo,Warner Bros.",1970.0
2,David Bowie,Glastonbury 2000,Rock,7.0,December 5 2018,Sean T. Collins,Contributor,"According to many British music publications, David Bowie’s headlining set at the Glastonbury Festival in 2000 is the greatest performance in the history of the legendary event. (NME, ever effusive, called it “the best headline slot at any festival ever.”) But it’s greatest that’s doing the work here, not performance. It’s not individual highlights that make the set so fondly remembered, but the overall gestalt. Like the old saw about climbing Everest, Bowie’s Glasto set mattered because it was there. By the time he took to the Pyramid Stage, Bowie had spent 15-odd years in the mainstream-music wilderness—first, post-Let’s Dance, making milquetoast megapop no one particularly liked, then rebuilding his reputation with experiments in everything from Pixies-inspired garage rock (Tin Machine) to concept-album Eno-industrial (Outside) to a Nine Inch Nails/Goldie hybrid version of drum ’n’ bass (Earthling). Different people liked these experiments at different times and in different amounts, though never at the level of his 1970s and early-1980s output. (Earthling rules, for what it’s worth.) During much of that period, his greatest hits were largely retired from service in his live sets. But now, with a generosity of spirit as lush and flowing as his hair—which hadn’t been that long since Hunky Dory—Bowie was back! Resplendently coiffed and backed by a familiar band of musicians (including pianist Mike Garson, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, and guitarists Mark Plati and Earl Slick, all of whom worked with the star for years), the once and future king of art pop was welcomed by the sprawling home-country crowd like Arthur Pendragon returning from Avalon. The resulting set is an ebullient greatest-hits package anyone who was ever a fan is sure to enjoy, almost automatically. Actually, make that mostly automatically. How Bowie performed songs like “China Girl,” “Changes,” “Golden Years,” “Ashes to Ashes” (which he misremembers aloud as being the most recently recorded song in the set at that point, though he’d already sung “Absolute Beginners”), “Let’s Dance,” and so on is much less important, both historically and to the festival audience, than the fact he was playing them at all. And sure enough, none of these hits—not even the surefire crowd-pleaser “Under Pressure,” which he’d dueted on so memorably with Annie Lennox at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert a decade earlier—do anything more special in this performance than exist. The band works much better when the material allows it to lean into its sleazy, session-pro sound. “Fame,” the John Lennon lost-weekend plastic-funk collab that seems to leave a trail of slime across eardrums whenever it’s played, sounds as dashing and debauched as ever. Recorded when Bowie was just a few months deeper into both 1975 and cocaine psychosis, the teutonic-occult behemoth “Station to Station” is another standout. Both the off-kilter groove of its main section and the barreling braukeller climax, with its guitar squalls and yelps of “It’s too late!,” feel made for massive crowds. (Which, as far as the Thin White Duke persona of that period is concerned, was sort of the point.) Moreover, hearing Bowie croon Kabbalistic jargon like “one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth” to said massive crowd serves as a helpful reminder that he remained, even then, one of the weirdest people ever to achieve festival-headlining success. The anthems also fare comparatively well. Sterling Campbell’s drums and Mark Plati’s guitars on “Ziggy Stardust,” for example, hit each downbeat in the song’s legendary glam hook so hard that it’s like they’re trying to beat the doomed pop-star character’s crazed fans back down off the stage. It’s immediately followed by another of Bowie’s career-defining hits, “‘Heroes’,” which has achieved an iconic second life of its own in the “David Bowie Is…” museum exhibit and Julien Temple’s Glastonbury documentary. Bowie and company ease into this one, downplaying the desperate romance and holding the soaring Robert Fripp guitars back until after the second chorus; by the time Bowie scream-sings “I, I will be king/And you, you will be myyyy queen”—adding the possessive pronoun to deepen the connection between himself and the audience, to whom he reaches an outstretched arm on the DVD—they’ve taken to the skies and don’t set down again until the song ends. Occasionally, intimacy works in his favor, which is no mean feat in front of a 150,000-person festival crowd. The set opens with his Station to Station cover of the Johnny Mathis ballad “Wild Is the Wind,” a terrific way to throw people who want to rock the fuck out off balance. After regaling the audience with a plea to sing for him should his recent bout of laryngitis prevent him from finishing—a charming bit of openly bogus self-effacement, given the brassy late-career warble he’d already deployed for four songs—Bowie drastically rearranges the vocal line on “Life on Mars?” to suit his aged range. Listeners inured to the song’s grandeur by decades of repetition now have to hang on to every word and note to see where it’s headed. It’s a brilliant maneuver by one of rock’s canniest communicators. But more often, such shifts weaken the songs’ power. The rip-roaring disco/hard-rock hybrid “Stay” comes across like a soundcheck in its too-quiet chorus, and “Under Pressure” is underplayed to its detriment. Understandably, Bowie fares better in the set’s happily confrontational closer, “I’m Afraid of Americans,” which makes his lower range sinister and sneering—a far cry from the back-to-back bangers “Rebel Rebel” and “Little Wonder,” recorded nearly 25 years apart, neither of which bang much at all as presented here. Whatever its historical import, Glastonbury 2000 is primarily a pleasant run-through of beloved songs for a gigantic, besotted crowd—a signal to people who were dying to love David again that, yes, he wanted to be adored. The DVD that accompanies the CD package conveys both the awe-inspiring size of that crowd and the excitement they and the artist shared about being there that night, making it almost certainly the proper way to experience the set. But compared to other official live Bowie releases, from the coke-addled craziness of the Diamond Dogs-era David Live to the far more muscular A Reality Tour set recorded a few years after Glastonbury… Well, as an album, this makes a helluva souvenir. It’s a chronicle of a particular moment in time, not a revealing glimpse of movement in a mercurial artist’s storied career. You kinda had to be there.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-glastonbury-2000/,Parlophone,2018.0
3,"Tyler, the Creator",Music Inspired by Illumination & Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch EP,Rap,7.2,November 21 2018,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"Tyler, the Creator has a somewhat weird relationship with Christmas. He released his debut mixtape, Bastard, on Christmas Day in 2009. He was arrested at Odd Future’s Christmas show for destroying equipment in 2011. It would be inaccurate to say he was ever Christmas averse (they were, ultimately, having Christmas shows), but he did write a song called “Fuck Santa.” Odds were likely against a rapper who once snarled, “If you’re the gift from God then I’m the Christmas wrap from Satan,” on a song called “Fuck This Christmas,” soundtracking an animated Grinch movie. And yet, Music Inspired by Illumination & Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch, a 10-minute, six-track EP, finds him getting even deeper into the holiday spirit, after contributing two new songs for the film’s official soundtrack. The Grinch, the second feature-length film adaptation of Dr. Seuss’ 1957 book How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (following Jim Carrey’s live-action movie of the same name from 2000), follows a crotchety creature with a heart “two sizes too small” living on the outskirts of a town called Whoville during their holiday season. He subsequently—you guessed it—steals the town’s Christmas but is later moved by the locals’ displays of affection for one another without gifts. After the soul-wrenching reveals of his 2017 album Flower Boy, it’s easy to understand why Tyler would resonate with a character like the Grinch. A one-time hellraiser who released a song called “Mr. Lonely,” Tyler undoubtedly must have a soft-spot for an outcast terrorizing a community out of frustration from not being seen. Which is probably why, in addition to collaborating with composer Danny Elfman on a reworked “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch,” Tyler wrote a new song: “I Am the Grinch,” a first-person performance of the character’s cantankerous nature that at times blurs the lines between truth and fiction. (When on that song Fletcher Jones sings, “You’re so problematic,” Tyler responds, “Yeah, yeah.”) It’s less roleplaying than it is self-awareness. Tyler is a Pharrell acolyte who has followed his mentor at many turns, so his pivot to 3D-generated feel-good cinema shouldn’t surprise anyone. (Both the Despicable Me franchise and The Grinch are produced by the animation studio Illumination. Pharrell soundtracked the former and narrates the latter.) This excursion into family-friendly content thankfully doesn’t produce whatever Tyler’s “Happy” might sound like; Tyler’s Grinch songs still sound like his, and not annoying, smoothed-down versions. The songs on Music Inspired by The Grinch often scan as Flower Boy b-sides or updates on old designs, music from his traditional catalog given a moderately (if noticeably) festive twist. Tyler recently tweeted that his goal with the Grinch EP was to make Christmas music that wasn’t “too xmasy” and that he was keeping seven-year-olds and their parents in mind. Both “seven-year-olds” and “parents” are new audiences for Tyler (the latter being an audience he once actively raged against), and “Christmas music” is a template he’s never seriously explored. In navigating that gap, some of the songs fall short of their intended effect. Tyler has always done what he thought best for the expansion of his sound (sometimes to his detriment), but here, perhaps for the first time, it sounds like he’s trying to rejigger some of his rudimentary practices to accommodate what he thinks this new audience wants to hear. “Big Bag,” the EP’s only real rap song, is almost patronizingly elementary in its lyrics (“Don’t make noise, my feet thin/I’m looking for the paper, same color my green skin”). Most tracks are sketches of songs, ideas stoked by his work on the movie but not necessarily seen to completion. He doesn’t quite have Pharrell’s ability to crossover just yet. Setting aside Tyler’s wonky first forays into all-ages entertainment, which show modest growing pains for a musician hoping to branch out and reach a wider demographic, these snippets carry in them many of the hallmarks of Tyler’s most satisfying music. With Christmas as his backdrop, he gets to really unleash the chords without consequence. He tinkers with sounds in this low-stakes arena with all the excitement of a kid tearing through wrapping paper Christmas morning. Little songs like the subtly symphonic “Whoville” and the kazooing “Cindy Lou’s Wish” give him leeway to futz with arrangements and progressions, in service of an audience he’d never thought of before. Using the Grinch as his guide, Tyler finds inspiration in the unlikeliest place.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tyler-the-creator-music-inspired-by-illumination-and-dr-seuss-the-grinch-ep/,Columbia,2018.0
4,Mumford & Sons,Delta,Rock,5.8,November 20 2018,Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,"Modern rock isn’t dead—it’s just weightless. Save for the occasional nostalgia act attempting to rattle the terra firma, most radio-ready bands in the ailing musical genre have recently ditched the riffs for glassy keyboards, echo-soaked percussion, and vocal affectations as wispy as the white trail of an e-cigarette. Even Arctic Monkeys—a band that spent much of the past 16 years wielding six-stringed weapons with such old-fashioned macho swagger that they dressed up like goddamn greasers to promote 2013’s AM—have packed up their guitars and launched themselves into zero gravity, lunar taquerías and all. The reach for streaming-algorithm brass rings has often been prescribed as the cause for this sudden dip in aggression and subsequent sonic flattening—but there’s precedent at play here too. Much-maligned British polymaths alt-J have spent much of this decade sanding down Radiohead’s Kid A-era abstractions to resemble smooth, uninteresting steel, and Coldplay’s influence also looms large, years after they finally managed to escape their own post-Radiohead shadow. There’s a revealing sequence in the just-released documentary Head Full of Dreams as the band performs at the 2001 KROQ Weenie Roast; sandwiched in between ultra-masc acts like Sevendust and SR-71, their sensitive pop-rock is met with boos and debris hurled at the stage. Fifteen years later, the cultural tables have definitively turned. And no big-ticket rock band in the last five years has carried Coldplay’s influence quite like Mumford & Sons, the previously shuffling folk-rock troupe led by Marcus Mumford, who unwittingly led the EDM-reactionary “real music” movement in the early 2010s. Revisiting the band’s first two albums of largely unremarkable Appalachian-isms, it’s surprising to recall the level of vitriol that Mumford and Sons were met with practically upon arrival; as evidenced by Sigh No More’s “The Cave” and Babel’s “I Will Wait,” they were occasionally capable of turning out a moderately pleasing tune, and Mumford’s own contributions to the soundtrack for the Coen brothers’ gloriously melancholic Inside Llewyn Davis was proof of his inherent musicality. But as time passed, Mumford & Sons got tired of sounding so out of time. 2015’s Wilder Mind ditched the washboard percussion and loud stomping for clean, streamlined, and positively Coldplay-esque rock music wallpaper-y enough for Zach Braff to disappear completely in; the following year, they gamely hopped over to Johannesburg for an EP of the same name, recording with African musicians like the Very Best and Baaba Maal. Delta, the group’s fourth proper LP, picks up where Wilder Mind left off, with a slightly altered approach; they’ve swapped producers, replacing Simian Mobile Disco’s James Ford with indie-mainstream Svengali Paul Epworth (Bloc Party, Adele), and they’ve incorporated some electronic gewgaws and rubbery beats into their anthemic music. You could conceivably slip most of Delta’s 14 songs in between recent hits from Imagine Dragons and twenty one pilots, and whether that’s a good thing is totally up to whoever’s listening. But Delta is also the strongest collection of songs Mumford & Sons have released to date; the cool-handed atmospherics and dreamy melodies here simply suit them better than any other sonic guise they’ve worn, from the cresting crescendo of opening track “42” to the rippling chorus of “Woman” and “October Skies”’ aching emptiness. Close your eyes while listening to the simmering mid-tempo pop of “Picture You,” and you can practically imagine Chris Martin belting it out in front of a massive crowd. More than anything else, Delta evokes Coldplay’s 2005 album X&Y—and not just in its predilection for gaseous choruses and moody melodies. Coldplay’s worst album is notorious for its imposing length, and the 61-minute Delta is similarly a slog, as Mumford & Sons’ new sound takes on a dull, beige quality when consumed for too long. When singer-songwriter Gill Landry shows up in the middle of “Darkness Visible”’s stormy pianos to recite an excerpt of John Milton’s Paradise Lost (yes, really), the dramatic finality is undercut by the fact that there are are four more songs that follow. But at least Landry’s poetizing lends some personality to the album. While Mumford & Sons have never sounded as purely palatable as they do on Delta, they do so at risk of achieving total anonymity—the aural equivalent of unflavored Alka-Seltzer dissolving in a glass of milk. Somewhat bewilderingly, the album’s strongest moment comes when Mumford & Sons evoke their folksy roots: the moonlit ballad “Wild Heart,” buried in Delta’s back half, which showcases Mumford’s lovely vocal talents over brushed drums, tinkling piano, and a quietly strummed acoustic guitar. “No one is better armed/To tear me down with a slight of the tongue,” Mumford murmurs, addressing not his fiercest critics but the give-and-take that is passionate, complicated love; it’s an intimate, revealing moment on an album in which he and his reformed jug-band compatriots paradoxically reach for a musical approach both more complex and more approachable, instead landing squarely in the realm of mediocrity.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mumford-and-sons-delta/,"Gentlemen of the Road,Glassnote,Island",2018.0
5,Charles Bradley,Black Velvet,Pop/R&B,6.6,November 17 2018,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,"Charles Bradley lucked into the kind of third act that few people could ever imagine. His early years were filled with neglect and poverty, buoyed by his discovery of James Brown when he was 14. As an adult, he drifted back and forth across North America, working odd jobs and singing on the side. In 2002, Bradley finally happened to be in the right place at the right time—in New York City, just as Daptone’s retro-soul empire began to rise. Bradley heard about Daptone’s success with Sharon Jones, another singer specializing in soul from another era. He was in his mid-50s and moonlighting as a James Brown impersonator named “Black Velvet,” one of many monikers he used in service of his JB tribute. Bradley introduce himself to Daptone co-founder Gabriel Roth, who heard something within that gravelly rasp. He signed Bradley to Daptone, linked him with producer and guitarist Tom Brenneck, and released the single “Take It As It Come,” launching a partnership that lasted until Bradley’s death from stomach and liver cancer in September 2017. Black Velvet rounds up the stray tracks Bradley made during his last decade, apart from his three studio albums for Daptone. Despite his illness, diagnosed just months after the release of 2016’s Changes, Brenneck didn’t abandon the idea of creating new music with Bradley. He wrote and recorded “Black Velvet” with his Menahan Street Band, the group that backed Bradley since his 2011 debut, No Time for Dreaming. But Bradley couldn’t muster the energy to sing it, so the instrumental plays here as a mid-album elegy: soft, slow, and sweet, a song in search of a singer. The presence of the unsung “Black Velvet” suggests Bradley didn’t leave much in the vaults. Black Velvet runs a scant 10 tracks, just three of which are newly unearthed and completely finished: “Can’t Fight the Feeling,” “Fly Little Girl,” and “I Feel a Change,” each dating from a different phase of his brief career. Otherwise, the compilation gathers songs stranded on singles or released as bonus tracks; a deluxe edition contains “Stripped Down Mixes” of songs from Bradley’s first two albums, spare variations on the original recordings designed to showcase his voice. This may lessen the feeling of discovery for longtime Bradley watchers, but Bradley’s music was always about maintaining tradition, not discovery. To that end, Black Velvet is a fitting tribute to the late singer, perhaps capturing the breadth of his appeal better than any of his actual albums. Black Velvet isn’t as cohesive or tight as 2013’s Victim of Love or the emotionally charged Changes. But its sampler nature showcases how Bradley could ease himself into any style of the classic soul era. The closest nod to Brown comes through the guttural growls of a deeply funky cover of Nirvana’s “Stay Away,” but the arrangement pulsates to fuzzy guitar more reminiscent of the paisley-bedecked Temptations than the Godfather Of Soul. Bradley leans closer to Otis Redding here, especially on a slightly stiff reading of Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold.” Brenneck and the Menahan Street Band shake things up by adopting any number of sounds from the golden age of AM radio. Black Velvet plays a little like a compilation of obscure vintage 45s. But listen closely, and the illusion dissipates. The production is a little too tidy, reliant on affectionate signifiers of classic soul that don’t necessarily allow the music to breathe. Paradoxically, the songwriting is loose. Bradley eschews lyrical precision for free-flowing imagery, as on “(I Hope You Find) The Good Life,” where he interpolates Barbra Streisand’s “The Way We Were.” The melodies can follow similarly elliptical routes. Such slips didn’t happen on stage, where Bradley could rely on the tricks he honed through years of hard work. But that can be said of every one of his records: They’re crafted artifacts that never quite captured his live charisma. Still, his weathered, yearning voice provided a focal point for Brenneck’s retro fantasias and helped freshen them. If anything, this farewell helps preserve the singer’s charms by illustrating how his revivalism wasn’t pure. He could adapt to whatever Brenneck gave him, making music that sounds tantalizingly out of time—a quality that will not fade as the years roll on without him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charles-bradley-black-velvet/,"Dunham,Daptone",2018.0
6,Anderson .Paak,Oxnard,Pop/R&B,7.0,November 16 2018,Torii MacAdams,,"With its languid pace and sunstruck mix of hedonism and tragedy, Los Angeles has always had a powerful and enduring relationship with funk music. The onset of G-funk in the ‘90s channeled the whining synthesizer experiments of Zapp and Parliament Funkadelic into something sepulchral and nihilistic and, in doing so, defined parameters for L.A. Funk. And now, you can hear Parliament-by-way-of-Dr. Dre in the music of Thundercat, Dâm-Funk, Terrace Martin, and Dre’s own Aftermath Records artist, Anderson Paak. On Oxnard, Paak’s follow-up to his 2016 breakthrough Malibu, the rapping, singing, and drumming polymath approaches funk from a rap perspective. When Paak allows himself to be instinctive and loose, Oxnard blends these influences with a comforting ease. Cloaked in natty threads and a horndog ladies-man persona, he favors bubbling bass, silky textures, and sunset timbres, forever somewhere between Snoop Dogg’s “G’z Up, Hoes Down” and Bootsy Collins’ “I’d Rather Be With You.” In that richly instrumented, sometimes misogynistic, and sexually debauched space, Paak has enough leeway to showcase his versatility as a vocalist. In the best possible way, Paak has a voice like ’80s R&B singer El DeBarge after a pack of cigarettes. Though Paak doesn’t have DeBarge’s piercing falsetto, his pitched-up, suggestive rasp is apt for a self-styled lothario. Throughout Oxnard, he exalts blowjobs and carps about a “petty bitch” and, on “Sweet Chick,” has sex with a skater who “watches anime while [he’s] laying dick.” Even his vaguely political song, “6 Summers,” opens with artless wish-casting: “Trump’s got a love child/And I hope that bitch is buckwild/[...] I hope she kiss señoritas and black gals.” Individually, his moments of hetero-masculine bluster are mostly passable—”Sweet Chick” is particularly enjoyable—but, in aggregate, they seem like a sock stuffed down the front of his jeans. Oxnard is at its best when Paak’s overt lasciviousness is muted by rap legends Kendrick Lamar, Q-Tip, and Tha Doggfather himself. (Dr. Dre interrupted leg day to make a rare appearance, but the stiff, militaristic delivery that marked his last album, Compton, is still present.) Paak and Lamar’s pastel boogie “Tints” is breezy, fun, and should have been released in the summertime; Q-Tip, his own high-pitched voice sharp as ever, recalls past heartbreaks on the ruminative “Cheers”; and Snoop Dogg who is transforming into rap’s own Willie Nelson as his hairline recedes, reminisces about his Long Beach childhood on the lolling cookout jam “Anywhere.” (Perhaps the most glaring sign of the end times is that Snoop Dogg now seems a moderating influence.) The crucial flaw of Oxnard isn’t its forgivable spates of juvenalia (after all, much of funk is thinly-veiled sexual metaphor and innuendo) or Paak’s occasionally stilted rapping—it’s the album’s sprawling, burdensome ambition. With its lyrics about a mythical, lesbian Trump offspring, the initial two minutes of “6 Summers” mistakes easy provocation for insight, the cocksure “Mansa Musa” seems more in service of Dr. Dre than it does Paak, and “Left to Right,” performed partially in Jah-fakin’ patois, is a golden, crispy Jamaican patty filled with compost. Paak can do nearly anything, but that doesn’t mean he should do everything. With its often effortless synthesis of funk and rap, Oxnard is a wide-angle portrait of Los Angeles’ hedonistic landscape—it’s just a little out of focus.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anderson-paak-oxnard/,Aftermath,2018.0
7,Metallica,...And Justice for All,Metal,9.3,November 3 2018,Sean T. Collins,Contributor,"…And Justice for All is the biggest metal band’s best album. I see you, Master of Puppets people, but I’ve strapped on the blindfold of Lady Justice and let the scales tip where they may: Justice wins. The songwriting of singer James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich is their most complex and vicious, retaining the power of their early thrash while jettisoning its simplistic schoolyard chants and avoiding the less-compelling hard rock tendencies to come. Use, abuse, experience, and enough beer and Jägermeister to make Keith Moon drive a luxury car into a swimming pool had tempered Hetfield’s reedy yell into something fuller and more forceful, with none of his later cigar-chomping bluster. The lyrics are a ground-level portrait of bureaucratic order pushing down on people too powerless to fight back. And the sound is nearly industrial in its ear-killing intensity, a piece of serrated steel designed to carve you and leave its nihilism in the wounds. Oh, and maybe you’ve heard this: You can’t hear the bass. In celebration of its 30th anniversary, Justice has been remastered and re-released in a variety of formats—from a three-disc reissue with bonus material to a six-LP, four-DVD, 11-CD monstrosity that features a hardcover book of photos and liner notes and is stuffed with enough prints, patches, and assorted swag to fill a Christmas stocking. Three decades later, Justice arguably stands as the only Metallica album that’s as beloved as it is controversial. (The rest tend to skew one way or the other.) After the death of original bassist Cliff Burton in a 1986 bus accident, the band hired Jason Newsted as his replacement. They toured with him, recorded a covers EP with him, gave him moments in the spotlight on stage, and... absolutely buried him in the mix of Justice, his first-full length with Metallica. The result is the most abrasive-sounding album to sell over eight million copies ever. It’s as if, instead of adding canned crowd noises or fake room tone, Metallica preloaded it with tinnitus. Newsted’s absence from the final mix is easy to explain, if not excuse. Some of the factors are innocuous: The three original members and the newcomer were not yet accustomed to each other’s playing styles, which led Newsted to track his basslines mostly to Hetfield’s rhythm guitar. Hetfield himself aimed for a low, pulverizing sound, eating up much of the range Newsted’s bass might have occupied. But reading the accounts of various producers, mixers, and engineers included in this set’s extensive notes suggests a more direct, less savory explanation: The bass isn’t there because the band, namely Ulrich and Hetfield, didn’t want it there. Was this an extension of the extensive hazing to which “Newkid” was subjected by the band for years and which contributed to his departure years later? Was it an unspoken form of denial, processing Burton’s death by erasing his replacement in the studio? Was it simply a power trip by the band’s most dominant personality, Ulrich, whose vision for the sound of his own instrument was so specific and demanding that the people who helped realize it still speak about it with horror? The answer is likely “all of the above.” But with the exception of producer Flemming Rasmussen, whose enthusiasm for Newsted’s largely unheard work makes him one of this story’s most endearing figures, and mixer Steve Thompson, who regrets having to follow Ulrich’s orders, all involved seem at peace now with the result. Even Newsted argues that “‘how it’s supposed to be’ is how it came out and what made a mark on the world.” To the great credit of everyone involved, this reissue is no Star Wars Special Edition-style attempt to rewrite the past. You may hear a little more snap and pop and dimensionality here and there, but this is a restoration, not a revision. Everything that’s made Justice sound assaultive and insane for the past three decades—closer to Ministry’s “Stigmata,” released around the same time, than the band’s own “Enter Sandman”—remains. (Should the itch for more bass persist, YouTube can scratch it.) It’s tough to muster much anger that the remastered version isn’t …And Justice for Jason when Jason himself feels justice has been served. Justice begins and ends at a breakneck pace. Opener “Blackened” serves the same role as “Battery” on Master of Puppets—ahead at full speed. It’s a meditation on nuclear annihilation and global extinction that, with a few tweaks, could apply to our worsening climate crisis: “Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy… Color our world blackened,” Hetfield shouts, his clipped words another piece of the percussive array. A screed about Hetfield’s “undying spite” for the parents who coddled him in conservatism, closer “Dyer’s Eve” is as intimate as “Blackened” is apocalyptic. As a parent now myself, I hear my own worst fears about tossing my children into “this hell you always knew” echoed. Between those points, the songs are expansive affairs, in length (nearly all of them clock in beyond six minutes) and in the techniques Hetfield, Ulrich, and guitarist Kirk Hammett use to make their sociopolitical points. The riff of “The Shortest Straw,” a song about the victims of political hysteria, speeds atop the song like it’s trying to outrun the mob. The slower, near-sludge sound of “Harvester of Sorrow” reflects its first line: “My life suffocates.” The martial hook of anti-conformist anthem “Eye of the Beholder” fades in from the distance, like an approaching armored convoy. In a rare moment of humor that comports with the band’s hard-partying profile outside the studio, “The Frayed Ends of Sanity” incorporates the “ohh-WEE-ohh, YOOO-ohh” chant from The Wizard of Oz. LL Cool J must have been taking notes. Justice’s centerpiece is, of course, “One,” the nearly eight-minute song about a mutilated war veteran. It sparks like an extended fuse before exploding in its final minutes with a Hendrix-style “Machine Gun” simulation and a Hammett solo that sounds like a panic attack. Thanks to an almost comically uncompromising video that spliced no-nonsense, black-and-white footage of the band with harrowing scenes from an adaptation of Dalton Trumbo’s antiwar novel Johnny Got His Gun, it’s the song that broke the band to the world, receiving heavy airplay on MTV despite having nothing in common with anything else on the network. Listening again, it’s amazing how little time and familiarity have dulled its impact. All its elements—from the dour four-note hook with which it begins to that gunfire burst—work as an experiential unit. You strap in and follow where it leads, even if that’s the “life in hell” of a limbless, eyeless, earless, voiceless shell of a man. At nearly 10 minutes long and with a dozen different time signatures, the title track employs many of the same techniques. Lyrics about the utter unfairness of the American legal system convey despair with force. “Hammer of justice crushes you,” Hetfield asserts before the chorus runs, “Nothing can save us/Justice is lost/Justice is raped/Justice is gone.” But these are not the distant, doomsaying pronunciations of some gimlet-eyed observer. Hetfield is also trapped in the belly of this horrible machine, and it’s getting to him, too. The chorus and the song itself conclude, “Find it so grim, so true, so real.” Hetfield draws out the last word as if to reassure himself that he is not hallucinating these horrors, that this is really happening. These humanizing touches give the otherwise impenetrable music a necessary air of vulnerability, a quality inaudible in the machinelike mix. In that sense, “To Live Is to Die” stands as the Rosetta Stone for Justice. A lengthy, plodding instrumental with sections where the guitars simulate melancholy strings, it’s the band’s tribute to its late bassist and an artistic outlet for their sublimated grief. Burton himself (with help from either the German writer Paul Gerhardt or John Boorman’s King Arthur movie Excalibur) provides the lyrics for the brief spoken-word passage, and they are bleaker than anything the band recorded before or since: “When a man lies, he murders some part of the world,” Hetfield murmurs as Burton’s voice from beyond. “These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives. All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home?” In “One,” the chorus runs, “Hold my breath as I wish for death”; here, Metallica mourn their late friend by posthumously publishing his own death wish. This isn’t The Black Album, but the spirit is as black as it gets. Despite the demons present in Metallica’s work and the largely unspoken trauma inflicted by Burton’s death, they played on. Along with a deep dive into Hetfield’s vault of riff experiments, writing sessions, demo recordings, and B-sides that include many covers, the set features six concerts (and snippets of three more). These demonstrate Metallica’s determination to plow past their recent tragedy, a recurring theme in the liner-note interviews and a visible throughline in the book’s hundreds of playful photos from photographer Ross Halfin and others. The recordings range from the previously released Seattle ’89 to a DVD of the bands performance at the tiny Delaware rock club The Stone Balloon. (Ulrich insisted on the gig just so he could say they’d played in every state). Though they vary in sound quality and though some include no more than a single Justice song, these sets document the group’s growing realization—audible in their blistering pace and Hetfield’s rising swagger—that they could blow any other band off the fucking stage. In his essay here, Sammy Hagar actually recounts that the pressure of having to follow Metallica on the Monsters of Rock Tour caused poor ol’ Dokken to break up. It would cheapen the power of ...And Justice for All to say it speaks to our present moment in some uniquely prescient way. Metallica weren’t predicting the future; they were describing what they saw around them. It made them world conquerors for a reason. But if Justice sounds like Now as much as it did then, it only proves the album’s point. And by refusing to soften the blow and reshape the record’s sonic signature into something more ear-pleasing, this reissue correctly implies that the music stands the test of time as well as the words. It does justice to every nightmare note.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/metallica-and-justice-for-all/,Blackened Recordings,1988.0
8,Vince Staples,FM!,Rap,8.2,November 2 2018,Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,"On Vince Staples’ debut mixtape, in a calm tone that suggested he had seen some shit, he rapped, “You want some positivity go listen to some Common.” Eight years later, he continues to live up to those words. In Vince’s Long Beach, California-centered world, it’s summer year-round, and while the season usually brings bright skies and beach weather, it’s also the time of the year when people are wilding—when the temperature increases, so does violent crime. The West Coast never gets a chance to catch its breath, a feeling brought by the change in season. In Cali, the block is always hot. Vince’s dark humor and borderline-troll personality have turned him into one of the genre’s most captivating characters, but his provocative side has been explored more often in interviews and social media than in his music. On his brisk, third studio album FM! he finally brings that personality to wax. The album begins with L.A. radio mainstay Big Boy describing the relaxing endlessness of a West Coast summer. But Vince is not with that and immediately debunks the fairytale: “Summertime in the LB wild/We gonna party ’til the sun or the guns come out.” With all the success he’s accrued simply being himself, Vince appears to realize he doesn’t need to shape his sound to appease out-of-touch label executives for his music to weave through the West Coast air waves; with the 11-track FM!— of which he only raps on eight songs—he creates the shadow broadcast of his dreams. Vince has made an album that’s true to himself, one that represents his image of Long Beach, his love for the music of the West Coast, and that unleashes the complete personality of Vince Staples. Vince’s tone is present on FM! in a variety of ways. Often he’s not even the one relaying it. Case in point: The project’s two interludes, presented as radio premiere snippets, don’t feature him at all. The radio has always been a home for trolling, consider, for example, Funk Flex’s frustrating and legendary “Otis” premiere on Hot 97 that teased the Kanye and JAY-Z collab for over 20 minutes. Vince uses the radio in a similar fashion, dropping in an Earl Sweatshirt knocker only to cut it off after 20 seconds. He follows that up later with the tease of a Tyga strip club anthem. The moments give Vince the chance to spotlight two artists he genuinely appreciates—but they’re also maddening. Because even though I’m aware I’m being trolled, I want more. Vince knows that and he’s rubbing it in my face. When it comes to the album’s proper songs, Vince is often influenced by classic G-Funk records, and Vince uses the genre to signal his California authority. He even has to deal with the old school conflict of trying to capture the nonstop party sound of summer while lyrically recognizing its darkness. The production on the album, mostly from the chameleonic Kenny Beats—who can go from ATL melodic ballads to punk headbangers to now West Coast turn-up tracks—moves at a rapid pace. Kenny’s ability to pinpoint regional sounds will make some go in the streets and dance like the New Boyz, until Vince’s sorrowful lines pop in to remind everyone that shit isn’t sweet: “First months still feel like summer/Cold weather won’t stop no gun, or wrong hat, wrong day, I killed my brother.” A song like “Fun” feels like the sort of radio single that YG would perform at award shows until you realize what Vince is saying. Lyrics like “My black is beautiful, but I’ll still shoot at you” will always drag it back to the gloom of Long Beach. When an artist decides they’re going to make an album for nobody but themselves, my first thought usually is, “Man, this is going to suck.” But Vince is at ease here, intertwining his personality into his somber celebration of Long Beach like never before. He’s rapping his ass off, and hooks are mostly an afterthought. He dips in and out of inventive flows, like on “Outside,” where he hits the pocket to make lines like, “Park gangster back then/At my Uncle Phil’s house with a mac 10” as memorable as any chorus. And on “No Bleedin” he enlists Bay Area favorite Kamaiyah’s buttery flow for a lively track about avoiding death that will melt into brains like an everyday pop song. On Vince’s station, the melancholy bars and the bounce come at the same time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vince-staples-fm/,Def Jam,2018.0
9,Queen,Bohemian Rhapsody OST,Rock,4.5,October 25 2018,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,"Queen have now existed longer as a band without Freddie Mercury than with him. Mercury died on November 24, 1991, 20 years after he joined guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. May and Taylor have kept the Queen brand alive for more than the quarter-century since, even shedding bassist John Deacon in 1997, or after it became clear that the reunion inspired by recording to the sounds of Mercury’s unused vocal tracks for 1995’s Made in Heaven was not a passing phase. Queen have toured with Mercury replacements, from former Free and Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers (essentially, Mercury’s antithesis) to able Mercury emulator and “American Idol” runner-up Adam Lambert. Absent another studio album, they have instead churned out archival releases, attempting to celebrate Mercury’s music while continuing without him. During his lifetime, Mercury saw the release of just two Queen compilations; there have since been at least a dozen. Here’s another one—the essentially extraneous soundtrack to Bohemian Rhapsody. Queen’s tension between the ever-present past and the actual present provides the key to the problems around the making of the new Bohemian Rhapsody, positioned as a fictionalized film about Queen’s history but largely understood as a Mercury biopic. After being cast as Mercury, Sacha Baron Cohen pulled out of the project following three years of development. He claimed that the surviving Queen members wished to sanitize an often-lurid story and that the plan called for the singer to die mid-movie, so the film would become a portrait of a band that “carries on from strength to strength.” Queen denied Cohen’s contention, but the anecdote crystallizes the inherent problem with the band after Mercury, anyway: They’re still trading on the glories they achieved with the late singer, forever living in his shadow. Whenever punters stepped up for a performance, they were paying tribute to the dearly departed with the fellow faithful. Whenever fans bought a live album (six between 2004 and 2016 alone), the recordings functioned as a substitute for never being able to see Mercury in concert. Whenever the faithful purchased a box set (again, five since 1992, plus four volumes of the Singles Collection), they were reviving memories of the first time they fell in love with an actual Queen LP. For decades, being a current Queen fan has meant accepting that the group’s glory days effectively ended with Mercury’s death. As both a film and a soundtrack, Bohemian Rhapsody reveals that even Queen have abandoned the notion that they exist outside of Mercury’s gravitational pull. The pivot becomes clear through the decision to end the film’s narrative when Queen achieved their last international triumph—when they stole the show at Live Aid in 1985. By ending on this emotional beat, the film avoids the messiness of depicting a bunch of survivors carrying on year after year, achieving a perfectly honorable but dramatically dull balance. This means the soundtrack also contains portions of that stellar Live Aid performance, the one noteworthy Queen set to not previously make it to disc. Their power at that moment owed, in no small part, to the fact that they were playing to a captivated crowd in their hometown of London and not the States, where they were considered passé by 1985. Since Bohemian Rhapsody is a soundtrack targeted at a wide audience, not an archival release suited for collectors, not all of the Live Aid performance is here; “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” and “We Will Rock You” are missing. The omissions underscore how superfluous Bohemian Rhapsody is. This isn’t a slight against the source material, which balances standards like “Another One Bites the Dust” and “Under Pressure” with a few more unreleased live cuts and a handful of tracks assembled for the film. But only one of those surprises: “Doing All Right” is resurrected from Smile, May and Taylor’s band before they linked with Mercury. Original Smile singer Tim Staffell leads this re-recording, a mini-suite that revives the spacy 1970s, complete with hippie harmonies and a pastoral midsection that culminates in headbanging. It’s early Zeppelin in miniature. The familiar favorites get some cinematic contours in this sequence. The album opens with a cheeky take on the “20th Century Fox Fanfare” with signature May fuzz and ends on the dual rallying calls of “Don’t Stop Me Now” and “The Show Must Go On.” But after a quarter-century spent recycling a catalog again and again, such attempts at flair deliver no actual pizzazz. At a certain point, everything that could be said about Queen has been said. Maybe that point is now. Not even a splashy movie can change that stone cold fact.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/queen-bohemian-rhapsody-ost/,Virgin,2018.0
10,David Bowie,Loving the Alien,Rock,7.1,October 20 2018,Chris O’Leary,,"Every autumn since 2015, a new David Bowie career retrospective box set arrives. These are comprehensive (just about every remix and single/album edit is compiled, some albums even appear twice if their sequencing changed at some point) and yet incomplete (they omit bonus tracks found on Bowie’s early 1990s Rykodisc reissues). The apparent aim is an “official release” Bowie master narrative, in boxes sturdy enough to prop up a table. Five Years (1969-1973) is the Major Tom/Ziggy Stardust figure eternally beloved by rock retrospectives; Who Can I Be Now? (1974-1976) is Kabbalist Plastic Soul Bowie; A New Career in a New Town (1977-1982) is “Bowie in Berlin.” And the latest, Loving the Alien (1983-1988), is mass-consumption Bowie, the Man Who Sold (Himself To) the World. He was never more popular than in the period documented in these 11 discs (and 15 LPs): writing songs for kids’ movies, singing with Tina Turner for Pepsi, duetting with Mick Jagger for Live Aid, recording some of the biggest hits of his life. It’s also a period with scant critical respect, a consensus that Bowie affirmed. He later rubbished many of his 1980s albums, calling them his “nadir,” claiming he was barely around while they were being made. As early as the Tin Machine era in 1989, he looked back on his ’80s with guilt and bile, acting as if he needed to quarantine himself from it. He even made up a story about burning his Glass Spider prop in a field at the end of his 1987 tour, a sacrificial bonfire of his mass-market ambitions (in truth, it was disassembled and sold for scrap). So Loving the Alien offers a reset for listeners—to hear these albums fresh, liberated from their composer’s dismissive opinions. In January 1983, Bowie signed a lucrative multi-album deal with EMI and hired Nile Rodgers to make him some hits. If still considered to be as major an artist as Fleetwood Mac or Michael Jackson, he was nowhere in their league in terms of units shifted. So the massive global success of Let’s Dance was no fluke—the album was planned as intricately as a troop landing or royal wedding. Made with economy (as Bowie hadn’t signed with a label yet, he funded the sessions and watched every penny like a hawk) and recorded and mixed in less than three weeks, Let’s Dance was an EP’s worth of songs padded out with covers and remakes—one of which, a new version of his and Iggy Pop’s “China Girl,” was a sure-fire hit, Bowie predicted. He was right. He was ready-made for MTV, but Let’s Dance was also a counter-move: an “organic” soul- and jazz-influenced sound instead of synth pop, even if having some of most colossal gated drums heard on a rock album to date. It was hooky, its tracks given booming sing-along choruses, its players included Stevie Ray Vaughan and the Chic rhythm section. And it had a remorseless sequencing: Its first side is three hit singles, back to back to back, with “Without You” as a cooling dish. The rest of the album is more or less B-sides, some odd (“Ricochet” mixes W.H. Auden with a clunking attempt at West African highlife), some ghastly (“Shake It,” whose refrain is the theme of a game show in hell). Let’s Dance had enough Bowie weirdness to make it stand out from other 1983 hit albums—“visions of swastikas” in “China Girl;” the cheery nihilism of “Modern Love”; the dark undercurrent in “Let’s Dance,” a lonely, desperate song beneath its trappings. To crown his chart successes, he toured throughout 1983. Its document is Serious Moonlight, a Vancouver live recording heretofore only available as a DVD. Serious Moonlight is him starring as the jet-setting author of “David Bowie songs,” taking audiences through a guided tour of his catalog. Setlists were more adventurous than one might expect (Lodger’s “Red Sails” made the cut, “Suffragette City” didn’t) and the core of the band—Carlos Alomar, Carmine Rojas and Tony Thompson—were a supple unit who likely grooved better without Stevie Ray Vaughan as lead guitarist. Playing to the biggest crowds of his life, the tour kicked off his “Phil Collins” years, Bowie later said. Audiences were an uneasy mix of glamsters with lightning bolts painted on their faces and yuppies who woke up whenever Bowie played a new hit. Tonight (1984) was the hangover: a curious, well-recorded, and often terrible record. Moods fluctuate from brittle exuberance to sleep-stung exhaustion to whatever Bowie channeled for his nightmare interpretation of the Beach Boys’ “God Only Knows.” It was the result of Bowie, mere months after his tour ended, stuck in Canada making a self-loathing album that he lost faith in midway through, opting to reuse “the EP’s worth of new tracks larded with covers and remakes” formula. Amid supper-club reggae (“Tonight,” “Don’t Look Down”) and amateur-hour rock opera (“Neighborhood Threat”), its few bright spots were “Blue Jean,” one of his most charming minor hits, the throw-anything-at-the-wall Iggy Pop and Bowie duet “Dancing With the Big Boys” (“Death to the trees!” “Your family is a football team!”) and the box set’s title track, “Loving the Alien,” a song that moves awkwardly, yearning to be a masterwork and falling short. He didn’t tour Tonight, barely promoted it, soon wrote it off. That said, the album was still a hit—going platinum in months, reaching No. 1 in the UK. Re: Call 4, the latest edition of the “singles and oddments” disc that’s in all of these Bowie sets, collects the rest of Bowie’s mid-1980s commercial peak. He was inspired by contract work, cutting tracks for four different films. Some were his best songs of the decade: “This Is Not America,” with the Pat Metheny Group; the beautiful, doom-struck “When the Wind Blows” for Jimmy T. Murakami’s anti-nuclear-war film; and his last grand moment as a pop singer—“Absolute Beginners,” the theme for a Julien Temple musical, and which nearly became a UK No. 1. Loving the Alien also has Dance, a collection of remixes. An earlier version was proposed in 1985 as a stop-gap compilation and blessedly wasn’t issued at the time, although Arthur Baker’s remixed “Dancing With the Big Boys” is even more garish fun than the original. The set’s centerpiece is Never Let Me Down (1987). Unlike Tonight, this was no contractual-obligation record. He labored over it and returned to hard rock, updating Ziggy Stardust for the late Reagan years. His songs would offer social commentary while also inspiring interpretative dances on tour; he even played some guitar solos. It wound up being an overcrowded, exhausting record whose aesthetic is a puree of Judge Dredd and Heavy Metal, the film Streets of Fire, mid-1980s “Doctor Who,” and BBC documentaries on “urban scenes” in New York and L.A. There were attempts at Neil Young eco-horror (“Time Will Crawl”) and reviving the Beatles as Day-Glo zombies (“Zeroes”). While its first side was a solid run of tracks, the album fell apart on the flip, which has some of the most gruesome compositions Bowie ever wrote. (He considered “Too Dizzy” so irredeemable that he cut it from reissues: Its exile continues on this set). There were too many ideas, too many competing needs, too many overdubs. Some of Never Let Me Down sounds as if it’s been stitched together in a moving car. See “Shining Star (Makin’ My Love),” which has Jim Carroll dopers, Joe Strummer mercenaries, a Mickey Rourke rap, Prince and Smokey Robinson cosplay vocals, and Bowie singing “I-could-make-you-hap-py-ev’-ry-god-damn-sin-gle-day-of-your-life!” as if he was reading off a Telex in the vocal booth. For all of its flaws, Never Let Me Down has a unity—the album has a somewhat charming period-piece feel to it now. It’s one of the most time-stamped “1987” records ever made. In its retooled, rearranged, and remastered form, Never Let Me Down 2018 often comes off as an upper that’s been turned into a downer—a song as gauche as “Beat of Your Drum,” a “Lolita number” (as per its composer) sung by Bowie all but resuming the role of Jareth the Goblin King and singing “I like the smell of your flesh!” is now weirdly somber. As Bowie’s vocals remain from the original record, and as these were over-the-top performances to ensure Bowie stood out in the traffic-jam mixes, hearing these vocals over downtempo and sparse new backing tracks can be jarring. The revised “Zeroes” in particular feels off, with Bowie’s vocals (and Peter Frampton’s sitar, an odd holdover from the original track) and the new backing tracks sounding as if they were taped at different speeds. There are inspired revisions. The new “Glass Spider” makes Bowie’s most Spinal Tap performance legitimately eerie while preserving its “wait, what?” sense of absurdity. Exhumed horns on “Day-In Day-Out,” which had been replaced by synthesizer stabs on the original album, give that track more bite. But there are questionable calls. Why turn “Shining Star” into a bad song from the early 1990s, and replace poor Mickey Rourke with Laurie Anderson, who has a cool, wry presence but still says lines like “blew heads out of shape in the name of Trotsky, Sinn Fein, Hitler, cash down”? And the sweet “Never Let Me Down” feels overworked with Nico Muhly’s strings, like a colorized film. The remake doesn’t improve on Never Let Me Down as much as it honors the original’s all-over-the-place frustration; it’s an interesting curio. Loving the Alien also has a Glass Spider tour performance which had only been available as part of a multi-media set in the 2000s. As the original sounded like a bootleg soundboard recording, it’s sonically an improvement at least. The tour was Bowie attempting things he’d do better at other times—filling setlists with mostly new or relatively obscure songs; having percussive dancers. Like much of his ’80s, Glass Spider offers more than the standard take suggests, if it’s still a holy mess at times. In Bowie’s highest-profile era, his work had a particular degree of tension—he wanted to make hits, he couldn’t quite do it sometimes, he half-hated doing it. Mass-market Bowie was still an oddity.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-loving-the-alien-1983-1988/,"Parlophone,Parlophone,Parlophone,Parlophone,Parlophone,Parlophone,Parlophone,Parlophone,Parlophone",2018.0
11,Lil Wayne,Tha Carter V,Rap,7.4,October 1 2018,Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,"We can only imagine what Tha Carter V might have sounded like in 2014 when Lil Wayne first announced it was finished. We’ll never know how many Trinidad James features that shelved draft of the album might have included, or what kind of play on “Blurred Lines” Wayne might have made, or which words he might have rhymed with Gotye. That album probably wouldn’t have been very good, and it almost certainly wouldn’t have been as rewarding or revealing as the belated final product that a humbled Wayne presented on his 36th birthday, after the four most trying years of his career. Lil Wayne was already mired in a brutal slump when the bottom fell out. Overexposed and uninspired, he’d become so resigned to his dwindling relevance after years of repeating the same jokes that he’d even stopped calling himself the greatest rapper alive. Then, for reasons that still aren’t completely clear, his mentor and father figure Birdman turned on him, refusing to release the album and all but holding his career hostage amid bitter contractual disputes. The two reconciled this year, but the hurt and betrayal are harrowingly documented on 2015’s Sorry 4 The Wait II, the most impassioned of Wayne’s otherwise lifeless 2010s mixtapes. Despite the toll those wilderness years took on him, it may have been for the best that Tha Carter V was delayed so long. It’s hard to imagine the rapper who’d released the dreadful I Am Not a Human Being II just a few months prior could have crafted an album this tactful and heartfelt. There’s a degree of quality control on Carter V that nobody could have expected from a 2018 Lil Wayne record, let alone a nearly 90-minute one. Wayne is no longer the lunatic trailblazer of his ’00s mixtape run, a rapper who in a just a couple bars could summon a purplish reality where fish flew through the skies and pigeons swam in the ocean. It’s hard for that kind of Christopher Robin imagination to survive this deep into adulthood. But more than any release since 2009’s No Ceilings, Carter V captures Wayne how we want to remember him: openhearted, word-drunk, and exhilarated by the possibilities of his own voice. He dials back his most obnoxious tics: the overbearing Auto-Tune; the incessant dick jokes; that awful, forced cackle that grated exponentially more with every tired crack. And even his lamer quips pay off in unexpected, sometimes emotional ways. “Blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan/Smokin’ science lab/I should have a tattoo that say, ‘I’m not like my dad,’” he raps over a nervy Zaytoven beat on “Problems.” Some of these tracks date back years, while others were reportedly finished just weeks ago. That could be a recipe for whiplash, but most of this material is woven together so seamlessly that its provenance is never a distraction. Nicki Minaj gives the most radiant R&B performance of her career on “Dark Side of the Moon,” and Kendrick Lamar brings Nicolas Cage-levels of insanity to his “Stan”-inspired spotlight turn on “Mona Lisa,” breaking out a dozen different voices as he dramatizes the breakdown of jealous boyfriend driven to the edge by his partner’s obsession with Weezy. Neither Wayne nor Kendrick let the song’s high concept get in the way of unbridled, ferocious rapping. On the more of-the-moment end of the spectrum, there’s “Don’t Cry,” an XXXTentacion feature that kicks off the album on a misleading, miserablist note, and “Let It Fly,” an undistinguished foray into Travis Scott’s boutique trap. But unlike 2011’s relentlessly trend-chasing Tha Carter IV, on Carter V, Wayne finally gives himself permission to fall behind the times. The record is never more electric than when Wayne engages with his past, victoriously returning to lanes he’s conquered instead of fixating on all the newer ones he’ll never own. He reunites with Mannie Fresh on the riotously fun throwback “Start This Shit Off Right,” accompanied by Young Money’s resident lovable goofball Mack Maine and a heavenly hook from the queen of radio’s yesteryear, Ashanti. Swizz Beatz gets in on the nostalgia, too, adrenalizing his club jam “Uproar” with a hyped-up flip of G. Dep’s “Special Delivery.” For as much as it’s been retooled over the last four years, one thing has remained the same since Tha Carter V was first announced: Its cover, a photo of a young Wayne with his mother Jacida. She looms protectively over the entire album, tearfully narrating its opening track and filling in Wayne’s biography in interludes. She’s not the only woman in his life who plays a prominent role. His eldest daughter Reginae capably sells a bittersweet hook on “Famous,” and his ex-fiancée Nivea graces his redemption tale “Dope New Gospel.” Their presence foreshadows the uncommonly personal tone of the album’s final stretch, especially the closer, “Let It All Work Out.” It shines new light on one of the tentpoles of Lil Wayne’s backstory: the self-inflicted gunshot wound he survived at age 12, which he’d always maintained was an accident. Now, he confirms, it wasn’t. “Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it/Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding,” he raps. It’s a powerful reveal, one he in effect waited years to share until he had found the right happy ending to frame it around, and it closes the record on a breath-stopping note. The most surprising takeaway from Tha Carter V, it turns out, isn’t that Wayne still has music this vital in him. It’s that after all these years, there’s still more to learn about him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-wayne-tha-carter-v/,Young Money Entertainment,2018.0
12,Prince,Piano & a Microphone 1983,"Pop/R&B,Rock",8.5,September 25 2018,Chris Randle,Contributor,"Just before Valentine’s Day in 1983, Prince released “Little Red Corvette,” which eventually peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100, his first single to end up higher on the general chart than the R&B one. Eighteen months later, he would become one of the biggest pop stars in the world, an artist made more mysterious by their fame. During sessions that lasted from December 1983 to April 1984, Prince finished Purple Rain, put together incidental music for the film, laid down the bulk of the Time’s Ice Cream Castle and the Apollonia 6 album, and recorded Sheila E’s The Glamorous Life, somehow without collapsing against the studio console. His songwriting was a glistening machine, animated by inner tensions. When some musicians die, their record company grasps for whatever material remains, like a medieval saint parceled out into increasingly meager relics. Prince left behind the inverse problem: Thousands of unreleased tracks with no suggestion for how to handle them. So far, his estate has treated that music with care; an expansive reissue of Purple Rain came out last year, but Piano & a Microphone 1983 is the first posthumous album culled entirely from Prince’s vault. Instead of piecing together one of the many projects he envisioned and abandoned, the executors found a session from Prince’s home studio, recorded to cassette in a single take; now and then you can hear him sniffling. Alone with his piano, Prince sounds unusually relaxed, mindful of the contradictions that always seized him yet willing to imagine their reconciliation. At the beginning of Piano & a Microphone, Prince asks his engineer: “Is that my echo?” Opening track “17 Days” would later become a moody dance number, the B-side of “When Doves Cry,” whose two repeated chords seem to be scraping across the ocean floor. The sketch heard here is much looser, syncopated by a tapping foot; Prince embellishes the notes as if tugging at a frayed thread. It throws the forlorn precision of his lyrics into deeper isolation—the cigarette-counting narrator might only be talking to themselves. Later on, Prince runs through “Strange Relationship,” which wouldn’t surface until 1987’s Sign o’ the Times. The finished version marries a playful melody to alienated emotions: “Baby I just can’t stand to see you happy/More than that, I hate to see you sad.” On Piano & a Microphone, the vocal dissolves entirely, as Prince strangles his own words. Several tracks from the cassette practice grander gestures still to come. Prince so admired Joni Mitchell that he flew her out to the premiere of his film Under the Cherry Moon on a private jet; covering “A Case of You,” his falsetto swallowed the phrase “holy wine” with reverent despair. The Piano & a Microphone recording is much shorter, barely 90 seconds long, but you can tell he returned to her song over and over again. It makes up a medley of sorts with “Purple Rain,” which is really a miniature, an idea of the “Purple Rain” that Prince would fashion from a live performance with the Revolution months later (their first time playing it in public). Hearing a fragment of that monumental song feels like coming across a sphinx’s head in the desert wastes. The “new” material on Piano & a Microphone has already circulated as bootlegs, but this album clarifies its details, rescues it from indistinct hiss. The most surprising moment is when Prince begins playing the gospel standard “Mary Don’t You Weep,” a song that must have been absent from all his potential tracklists, even ad-libbing fraught lyrics: “I don’t like no snow, no winter, no cold.” Fingers slinking over his piano with heavy steps, vocals slurring at the edges, he gives the spiritual a physical force. “There has always been a dichotomy in my music,” Prince once said. “I’m searching for a higher plane, but I want the most of being on earth.” Piano & a Microphone is both omen and artifact, a rehearsal for another life.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/prince-piano-and-a-microphone-1983/,Warner Bros.,2018.0
13,Led Zeppelin,The Song Remains the Same,Rock,7.3,September 8 2018,Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,"The witching hour approaches. A full moon peeks through the thick, English fog. Jimmy Page, hair curled like a hobbit’s, crawls up the slopes of a jagged mountainside. At the summit, he encounters a Gandalf figure in a white, hooded robe, lamp in hand. The mountain wizard raises his head and fixes Page with a serene look. But this is no passive observer—the wizard’s wrinkled visage ages in reverse to reveal Page himself, first as a man, then a boy, a baby, a fetus bathed in starlight. Somewhere, in the distance, we hear the atonal skronk of a violin bow slapping against guitar strings. The wizard re-ages. Lightning crashes. Then, he pulls out a sword. Maybe it was never publicly acceptable to be a nerd until the internet made everyone a nerd. But the historical record does not quite account for the world-breaking popularity of Led Zeppelin, who married a musical synthesis of blues, rock, and cock with a deep love of all things occult and fantastical, and more specifically, The Lord of the Rings. They worked from the midpoint between the jocks and dungeon masters, singing metaphorical allusions to anal sex and literal references to Gollum. The critics thought they were hacks, but the fans regarded them as golden gods, and for a decade they expanded and crystallized the myth of rock’n’roll as portal to primordial consciousness. Stoned longhairs will blast “Dazed and Confused” out of parking lots for the rest of time, but to see what Zeppelin were all about you have to watch Robert Plant perform. A newly remastered reissue of The Song Remains the Same, the band’s 1976 concert film, provides a technicolor document of the band at its extravagant, excessive powers. Filmed during a three-night stint at Madison Square Garden in 1973, The Song Remains the Same is not the best music the band ever played or the best they ever sounded live. But it is a faithful portrayal of Led Zeppelin during their imperial era, as they rode an unbroken streak of creative genius and shattered sales records all over the world. (This reissue follows a previous remaster from 2007; the new one is louder and available on more formats, if that’s your thing, and switches up the sequencing to allow a nearly half-hour long version of “Dazed and Confused” to live on its own side of vinyl.) The Song Remains the Same was stitched together from those three shows (in part because the band was partying too much to nail it every night), and the film footage was fleshed out with new material shot at a sound stage the next year, where the passage of time required bassist John Paul Jones to wear a wig. In When Giants Walked the Earth, a highly subjective and salacious biography, Jimmy Page said the soundtrack “wasn’t necessarily the best live material we had but it was the live material that went with the footage so it had to be used. So, you know, it wasn’t like A Magical Night. But it wasn’t a poor night. It was an honest sort of mediocre night.” The soundtrack is made more relevant by the accompanying movie, which comes as part of a “super deluxe boxed set” including assorted memorabilia associated with the film and an essay from Cameron Crowe. The movie combines the traditional concert film with a few backstage vignettes (mostly starring band manager Peter Grant, a notoriously bombastic and protective figure) and, most infamously, a series of narrative sequences featuring symbolic representations of the band’s members. That’s how we get Jimmy Page climbing up the mountaintop, and somehow more absurdly, Robert Plant sailing a skiff toward a beach where he buries a flaming sword in the sand and battles through several knights to save a fair maiden. These cornball scenes were dated even then—the movie, which blew through its deadline by 18 months and required two directors to finish, was savaged by critics—but they do give you a sense of the magnified egos at play. The performances do the rest: the defiantly open-shirted Plant cradling his microphone against his sweaty chest; Page’s sparkly epaulets and double-necked guitar dramatics; the entirety of “Moby Dick,” a technically astounding drum solo nonetheless so alienating as a visual experience that the rest of the band would literally leave the stage to refresh their drinks. Zeppelin hadn’t yet lost the thread—that would happen a few years later, when heroin entered the picture—but they still sounded a little haggard. Plant’s quadruple-octave range was starting to go, evidenced by the high notes he doesn’t even attempt on the notably restrained “Rock and Roll” and “Over the Hills and Far Away.” (The latter, which features a wildly meandering solo, was left off the initial film release.) But even a haggard Led Zeppelin was an elemental example of what a rock band could sound like at its most kickass. John Bonham hits his drums like he’s tunneling a hole through space and time; Page’s sleazy, psychedelic guitar tone would launch a million imitators. Playing this loud is a mandate, not a suggestion. To avoid overthinking it: It’s Zeppelin in their near-primes performing nearly two hours of some of the heaviest music ever made. If you’ve ever enjoyed their music, or rock music in general, you’re going to find something to enjoy. You have the paleosexual grooves of “Whole Lotta Love,” the cosmic frippery of “Dazed and Confused” (the violin bow, however pretentious, still sounds great), the head-kicking riffage of “The Ocean” and “Black Dog.” That they pull off the tempo and coordination required on the title track is a kind of magic trick, and though Plant has disavowed his “Does anybody remember laughter?” ad lib during “Stairway to Heaven,” it’s still a sweetly earnest moment in a song that, to many ears, has calcified into a hokey sigil of the whole classic rock era. Rock stars would soon age out of presenting themselves like this without irony, or self-consciousness. Why not giggle about bustles and hedgerows, if that’s what it took to have a good time? Despite his fraying vocals, Plant is the star of the film due to his sun-god looks, a driving force of the band’s appeal. (”They thought it was my fault Robert Plant had such a big cock,” said director Joe Massot, who was eventually replaced, of an early screening the band hated.) Not long after, he’d break his leg in a car accident, signaling a chaotic period where Page got deeper into drugs and Bonham got deeper into the alcohol addiction that made him an occasionally violent terror. Most tragically, Plant’s five-year-old son would die suddenly in 1977, creating an emotional chasm between him and the band that never healed, not before Bonham’s death in 1980. They were a transcendent group for only a short while, a function of their era and talent. Because they never stayed together like the Rolling Stones, or became public-facing cultural ambassadors like the solo Beatles, it can feel a little tricky to place Led Zeppelin in a modern context. Maybe it’s banal to suggest yet again that the popularity of rock music has diminished since the 1970s, but it’s frankly mind-blowing to watch this and remember that millions of people once wanted to watch Robert Plant pretend to sword fight and Jimmy Page encounter a fictional wizard version of himself, wrapped around scruffy solos and vocal runs meant to ignite stoned minds. It feels like a true documentary, in that it locates and explains this particular moment in time. Unlike some other concert films, there’s plenty of audience shots. Two fans, seen during “Since I’ve Been Loving You,” stick out to me: A woman in some kind of embroidered robe, who sits with her hands folded as though she’s watching a play. Next to her, a man in a mustache stares ahead, mouth open, totally slack-jawed and transfixed. Slowly, he begins to smile.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/led-zeppelin-the-song-remains-the-same/,"Atlantic,Swan Song",2018.0
14,Mac Miller,Swimming,Rap,7.5,August 3 2018,Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,"When Ariana Grande left Mac Miller this spring, he lost a relationship, a collaborator, and muse. Miller’s 2016 effort The Divine Feminine was recorded closely with Grande and doubled as a love letter to the woman he’d hitched his star to. He’s gone from “you and me against the world” to just “me against the world,” and as much as he tries to convince himself that’s almost as good on his warm but wounded fifth album, Swimming, he knows it’s not. At its lightest, Swimming plays a little like Mac Miller’s own Forgetting Sarah Marshall, an amiable account of involuntary bachelorhood. “I know I probably need to do better, fuck whoever, keep my shit together,” he ambles over an aloof beat on “Smaller Worlds.” On “What’s the Use,” he shrugs off his foibles over some buoyant roller-disco, accompanied by low-key vocal assists from Snoop Dogg and Thundercat. Miller’s flow is limber and self-deprecating; he tries any pattern of singing or rapping that might lift his spirits for a few seconds. He’s doing his best to find the humor in a situation that isn’t really funny, as his arrest for a DUI and hit and run this May made all too clear. Miller has long been open about his struggles with addiction, which Grande cited in her decision to end what she called a “toxic relationship.” But those looking for any dirt-dishing or ax-grinding on Swimming will be disappointed. “Everybody want a headline, I don’t got nothin’ to say,” he rapped on “Programs,” a loose track from May with more of a chip on its shoulder than any that made the album. Even at Swimming’s bleakest—“Self Care/Oblivion,” a dispiriting account of his pain-numbing regime, or “Hurt Feelings,” which shines some light on his mental state during that DUI—Miller resists the suggestion that anybody in particular is to blame for him bottoming out. The furthest he’ll go is acknowledging life was a lot easier with Grande than without her. “She put me back together when I was out of order,” he admits on “Perfecto.” This sort of heartsick longing is not exactly something new—in 2018, you can’t toss a stone without it landing in some chart-topping sad rapper’s styrofoam cup. But Miller explores his headspace with considerably more focus than Drake, Future, or Post Malone, artists who sometimes cut emotional corners in their rush to the next banger. An album with nothing but time on its hands and an understanding that healing is a slow, tedious process, Swimming is most engaging when it details the simple things Miller tells himself to keep his spirits up. “Every day I wake up and breathe/I don’t have it all but that’s all right with me,” he sighs on “2009,” even though he only sounds half-convinced. He’s come a long way since his overbearing kid brother act of his early Blue Slide Park days. Where he used to mug over his music relentlessly, on Swimming he mostly lets the beats breathe, clearing ample space for the record’s peaceful orchestral swells and blushing keyboards. He’s also singing more than ever, and he sounds better than ever doing it. Modest as it is, his voice is expressive in ways his plainspoken prose could never be, capturing his resignation without turning sadness into a performative spectacle. As always, Miller remains a step behind the prestige artists he emulates—Chance the Rapper, Anderson.Paak, and, increasingly, Frank Ocean, whose nonchalant songcraft looms large here. Swimming is less virtuosic than those artists’ recent works, but no less heartfelt, and the album’s wistful soul and warm funk fits Miller like his oldest, coziest hoodie. He may be unable to escape his own head, as he laments on the opener “Come Back to Earth,” but he’s decided to make himself as comfortable as possible while he’s trapped there.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mac-miller-swimming/,Warner Bros.,2018.0
15,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Cosmo’s Factory,Rock,8.8,July 22 2018,John Lingan,,"The four hirsute, sheepish men of Creedence Clearwater Revival were greeted as conquerors when they arrived in London in April 1970. From humble beginnings in suburban San Francisco, the quartet had ascended, in barely a year, to the absolute height of late-’60s rock stardom. They’d headlined Woodstock, released an ongoing run of multi-platinum albums and singles, and in 1969, did what seemed impossible at the time: They outsold the Beatles. They looked hale and healthy, too, muscular but bashful dudes in Army surplus jackets and flannel shirts. They lacked any real group personality or public image beyond tough-guy smiles and ubiquitous hits. Meanwhile, the Beatles were looking lurid. Since 1968, the rumors were all about heroin and bitter interpersonal squabbles. Just as Creedence arrived to begin their first European tour, Paul McCartney released advance copies of his first solo album to the media alongside a “self-interview” that referred to his “break with the Beatles.” There was suddenly no one left to outsell. For those next two weeks in April, Creedence did what they always did: played an unchanging set for one adoring audience after another, then refused encores. (Their shows were so consistent that they famously released a “Live at the Royal Albert Hall” record that was actually recorded in Oakland). This was John Fogerty’s policy, one of an increasing number of rules that he’d created to match his total control over their group’s songs, production, and finances. His bandmates—drummer Doug “Cosmo” Clifford, bassist Stu Cook, and Fogerty’s brother Tom on rhythm guitar—went home to the Bay Area with wonderful memories of their self-taught bashing ringing out in opera houses. But they also remembered standing just offstage, thousands of new fawning converts screaming for more, and their leader expending all his clout just to deprive them of that worship for some meaningless personal code. That was Creedence Clearwater Revival in spring and summer of 1970, as they finished and released their fifth album, Cosmo’s Factory. They had started playing music together in middle school and had been slugging their way through a music career for more than a decade in various iterations. There was the studio session backing an over-the-hill doo-wop singer, the years with Tom on lead vocals, the costumed jangly years as the Golliwogs. Having now achieved hard-won but revelatory success, they were still plagued by the same stubborn-garbage, masculine hardwiring that they’d been carrying since adolescence. They were all raw nerves and personal vendettas but were operating musically like one four-limbed brain. You must remember: Literally and figuratively, they were brothers. When you hear one of those songs, you know the ones—in Vietnam movies, The Big Lebowski, classic rock radio, your uncle’s radio by the grill—you’re hearing bone-deep, childhood-borne closeness and codependency. They learned how to play instruments together, how to cultivate a discerning musical taste, how to give their music that elusive, ineffable “in-between” that their bluesman and R&B heroes had. They started with squaresville garage-band dance-party stuff, then slowly absorbed Booker T. & the M.G.’s, Bakersfield country, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Roy Orbison, Muddy Waters. John Fogerty grew into his role as bandleader while Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, and Berry Gordy were developing instantly recognizable musical brands. They had sounds as distinctive as Sun or Chess, which Fogerty also revered for their spareness and guitar tones. This was hardly in step with the psychedelic music that Creedence’s Bay Area peers were developing, but Fogerty was resolute. He was developing an entire aesthetic vision and the whole responsibility for enacting it rested on his brother and his schoolmates. Cosmo’s Factory begins with the purest expression of those varied inspirations and pressures that the band ever recorded. “Ramble Tamble” has somehow escaped the kind of classic-rock canonization of “Black Dog” or “Baba O’Riley” as an epic album opener, but it stands tall among them. It opens with a jaunty country-funk riff that sounds almost like James Brown once the band kicks in, then they instantly switch gears into roaring double-time rockabilly. Fogerty’s guitar and howling vocals are both treated with the same ghostly slap-back effect that he’d borrowed from Sun and Chess. He shout-sings one of his signature apocalyptic scenes, full of images of junk and ruin, like “Bad Moon Rising” but furious. Then the band slows down, Fogerty’s sketch of “mud in the water…bugs in the sugar” comes to a halt and is replaced with a slowly building space-rock squall unlike anything that Creedence, typically so earthbound, ever recorded. Then they dissolve that and rebuild the rockabilly section, where Fogerty returns to his angry-preacher routine. He’d written about specters and new dawns before,  but this was the first time that he’d conveyed the idea in music itself. “Ramble Tamble” sounds like a band fighting its way to find new horizons, new styles, all the way past language in the title. Near the end of the record, the 11-minute take on “I Heard It Through the Grapevine,” reverses the opening song’s sense of adventurousness, turning Motown’s sophisticated dance song into a droning, claustrophobic blues. The rest of Cosmo’s Factory is a hodge-podge, which was typical of Creedence’s full-lengths. Between the extended tracks and a handful of previously released hits like “Travelin’ Band” and “Long as I Can See The Light,” they included lively but inessential covers like “Ooby Dooby” and “Before You Accuse Me.” It’s not a statement record or some kind of grand step forward in the band’s evolution. It’s just an unpretentious collection of songs, named for their little San Francisco practice space and featuring one of the least affected album covers of the classic rock era. Somehow, in 1970, the year of Kent State, the My Lai massacre trial, and Let It Be, no album spent longer at No. 1 in the U.S. Creedence broke up within two years. Their roiling interpersonal difficulties explain the brevity of Creedence’s success, but what accounts for its intensity? How did a band so far apart from their peers and so untrendy become the most popular group in America—and during a time of so much unrest? Creedence never wrote a love song, barely ever used vocal harmony, never employed guest musicians, and had a strict (and mutually agreed-upon) policy against alcohol and drug use during music-making. They were not exactly the face of late-’60s youth culture, but they were its most consistent soundtrack. Those earlier iterations of the band were all relatively square—“a garage band, a little band” is how John Fogerty described them. It was his twin obsessions with recording technology and old blues that opened the band to new vistas. Starting with “Born on the Bayou,” on 1969’s Bayou Country, Fogerty summoned a mythic rock’n’roll South lyrically as well as musically: his songs were as spare and tight as Stax, whose records, along with Wilson’s and Spector’s, he studied like a scholar. But his words could bend toward Uncle Remus or the Book of Revelations. On Cosmo’s Factory, “Lookin’ Out My Back Door” is the former and “Run Through the Jungle” is the latter. “Back Door” paints a children’s-book scene of dancing animals, while “Jungle,” a staple of Vietnam movies, depicts a literal army of Satan. Fogerty didn’t write from one clear vision for America; instead, he tried different visions on like hats, singing passionately about lazy riverboat days as well as societal collapse. Another Cosmo’s Factory standout, “Who’ll Stop the Rain,” depicts a storm that lasts generations, leaving widespread sadness and confusion. Moments of great civil unrest tend to refocus our view of the past—we see previously overlooked steps to destruction with renewed clarity. The Vietnam era spawned many pop acts with a deep sense of history, from the Band’s Faulknerian evocations to the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band’s epochal bluegrass love-letter, Will the Circle Be Unbroken? But none had John Fogerty’s monastic understanding of pop record structure or his clear-eyed obsession with instrument separation. They had notable album tracks throughout their career, but Creedence were a singles band, where Fogerty’s fussy, learned vision was best-expressed and his sidemen showed themselves of highest musical sensitivity. Listen to the way they push and pull Fogerty throughout “Heard It Through the Grapevine,” following his solo as much as prodding it on. The simple gallop of “Ooby Dooby” is just marvelous from the first note, while “Long as I Can See the Light” stands as one of Creedence’s most powerful ballads and soulful, nuanced band performances. Clifford’s bass drum alone makes the song sound heartbreaking. So it almost seems silly to ask why Creedence—and Cosmo’s Factory—were so popular as the country burned. They played ’70s rock with the emotional intensity of early R&B and the workaholic tightness of the Muscle Shoals or Dixie Flyers bands. They defined the early years of album rock, but their background was in the single format. For all their aww-shucks media personalities, their sound was flexible enough to be fun, angry, sorrowful, or worried. They were a band that could match the sweaty, crowded emotional tenor of America at war, and they could please anyone but themselves.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/creedence-clearwater-revival-cosmos-factory/,Fantasy,1970.0
16,Florence and the Machine,High as Hope,Pop/R&B,5.7,July 4 2018,Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,"In 2011, The Guardian coined the phrase “the New Boring” to describe the creeping malaise the UK charts led by Adele and Ed Sheeran and their ballads and sales. Like quicksand, the New Boring devoured promising vocalists like Jessie Ware, post-“Latch” Sam Smith, and Katy B into the adult-contemporary drears. By then, Florence and the Machine had released one album (2009’s Lungs) and were gearing up for another (Ceremonials). But despite working with Britain’s finest purveyors of boring, such as “Rolling in the Deep”’s Paul Epworth, they seemed immune. Say what you will about the gale-force drama of Lungs or the Pre-Raphaelite witching of Ceremonials: they were never boring. Florence Welch’s vocals—the oft-maligned but best part of her band—make that difficult. In Welch’s voice, “Shake It Out” or “Drumming Song” really do sound like cosmic destruction is afoot due to, respectively, a hangover or a crush shifting his feet slightly. Hers is a massively influential voice, too; almost all the so-called “indie voice” affectations of today’s pop stars either come from Sia or Florence Welch at small scale. Even her dance phase with Calvin Harris worked: Who better to convey EDM’s big, unsubtle emotions than the high priestess of big, unsubtle emotions herself? Where there’s EDM excess, there’ll probably be a sedate comedown one album later—or, in Florence and the Machine’s case, two of them. High as Hope, like predecessor How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful and the group’s MTV Unplugged stint, is supposed to be Welch’s requisite stripped-down, personal album. Unlike How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, it actually has a claim. She’s credited as a producer for the first time. The rafter-shaking anthems still exist, but they’re less often belted but delivered conversationally, like a frank chat with a friend who just happens to chat at top decibel. A couple songs attempt to be piano ballads before the big gospel choruses claw their way out of the arrangements. It’s a Florence and the Machine album with a track called “No Choir,” which says it all. It’s also a Florence and the Machine album with every song produced with Emile Haynie, which also says it all. Like Jeff Bhasker or Alex da Kid, Haynie has a signature style: enormous ballads made of dusty air, like the dregs of Lana Del Rey’s Born to Die or multiple Eminem ballads. It’s boring as bombast. Some artists can make that work, like FKA twigs, who knows how to work with space, or Kanye West’s “Runaway,” which is meant to sound empty. But Florence and the Machine are a terrible fit. “South London Forever” shows how the two producers are at odds. Welch is relatively sprightly for someone with her vocal heft, surveying her old drinking grounds with the wry eye of early Laura Marling. Haynie, characteristically, tries to turn the track into an anthem, piano and percussion chugging along as if on uphill roller-coaster rails. Nobody wins: Welch provides no anthem while Haynie unendingly hurries her along toward one. Attempted anthems abound. “Grace,” an apology for the mess Welch left her little sister, begins with the Rachel Getting Married-esque “I’m sorry I ruined your birthday” and reflects amid jazzy restraint—but then, in come the choirs, because of course they do. The same for Patti Smith tribute “Patricia;” the same for “100 Years,” or “June,” a glum song about a high. Even when the swells work, they feel overly familiar and formulaic—particularly on an album with a smaller lyrical scale. Welch’s songwriting falls from the clouds of heady, sumptuous myth to the mundanities of being a big-name musician: performing (it’s lonely), fame (it’s hollow), and, too frequently, songwriting itself (it’s hard). But for every bracing moment like, “At 17, I started to starve myself”—the opening line of single “Hunger,” which Welch considered deleting for too much candor—there’s an abstraction like, “I felt nervous in a way that can’t be named” or a faux-profundity like, “I don’t know anything except that green is so green.” The less allegorical Welch gets, the less she gets away with airiness. And while her subject matter is more direct, her melodies are more meandering, unmoored from structure. This wandering works for a memory piece like “South London Forever,” but elsewhere, verses stumble aimlessly around choruses to the point where three-and-a-half-minute songs like “Hunger” feel twice their length. At times they don’t seem like songs, perhaps since some weren’t supposed to be: “Hunger,” according to Welch, was conceived as a poem, perhaps one meant for her forthcoming Useless Magic collection. This explains a lot. There are tracks to like here. The first half of “Grace” is coolly understated and could be affecting if only it continued in this vein. “Big God” brings in Jamie xx on writing, and the difference is immediately obvious. The song’s ominous piano line, storm-cloud strings, and smoldering sax from Kamasi Washington (who plays throughout) provide tumult worthy of Florence and the Machine’s highest drama. The track sounds like it comes from a more ambitious album, where Florence and the Machine still do what they still do best: blowing little everyday feelings to the scale of the Book of Revelation. More often, though, Welch sounds content and resigned, recollecting the stormy Saturdays of the past with a Sunday-morning penitent’s shrug and a born-again sigh. How small, how beige, how disappointing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/florence-and-the-machine-high-as-hope/,Republic,2018.0
17,Nirvana,Incesticide,Rock,8.7,July 1 2018,Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,"In the living room of his tiny, late-’80s home in Aberdeen, Washington—the small town where it has been said there is nothing to do but “smoke pot and worship Satan”—Kurt Cobain filled a bathtub with half a dozen turtles. They are model beings for shy, hardened people: wise, solitary, with wearied eyes, and the envious ability to escape inside of themselves completely. “Turtles basically have this ‘fuck you’ attitude,” Cobain explained in Michael Azerrad’s 1993 biography Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana. Giving voice to his aquatic comrades, he went on, “I’m stuck in the tank, I’m miserable, I hate you, and I’m not going to perform for you.” Being a classic water sign—sun in Pisces, moon in Cancer—Cobain naturally related: Those tough exteriors were facades for an overwhelming sensitivity to the merciless world, a feeling Cobain voiced with every note. Nirvana spent seven tortuous years and three hard-candied albums bottling the feeling of first seeing that this world is bullshit. Siphoning colossal power out of classic rock and delivering it back to the disempowered, Nirvana voiced the precise moment at which innocence is revealed to be merely a myth. No band before or since has made contempt so catchy, disenchantment so explosive, or disaffection so affecting. Negativity became a genre, a frisson of excitement, and an odd comfort. Nirvana’s beautiful melodies made ugliness a virtue. Sex Pistols said “no future” but for Nirvana things were worse. “No recess,” Cobain convulsed on “School,” from 1989 Sub Pop debut Bleach. “You’re in high school again.” Hell on Earth is not to come. It is right fucking now. We call that teen angst, but it is not only for teenagers. It hums in the background of life, flavored by the sour taste of knowing that things are mostly unfair. At any time, any age, it is possible to feel utterly disconnected, misunderstood, maladjusted, an alien dropped to Earth, suspicious, sullen, hands in pocket, headphones on: Nirvana. A Nirvana song is a coming-of-age line in the sand endlessly redrawn. It is an excavation of all the frustration below a quietly jaded heart. A Nirvana song is a reality in which you never fell off your skateboard. It is a Walkman that is a portal to some semi-universal misfit energy across time and space, an invitation to smoke weed as far away from the human race as you can manage on a Wednesday, the combustion that occurs when sequestered pain is finally unleashed. It has no gods and no masters. Cobain’s voice became a friend in the heads of lonely people on difficult terms with society everywhere, screaming but also subliminally whispering you are not alone. Incesticide was released on December 15, 1992, a year and three months after Nirvana—Cobain, fellow Aberdeen weirdo Krist Novoselic, and ex-hardcore kid Dave Grohl—became one of the biggest bands on Earth ever. It’s an unlikely appendage to the globe-smashing Nevermind: Instead of rushing out another LP to further propel Nirvana to the extreme edges of perilous fame, they slid their fans a mixtape. Incesticide is raw sparks to Nevermind’s pop explosion, collecting Peel Sessions, covers, demos, four different drummers, vocal sounds like dying feral animals, unabashed feminism, and yeah, a devil-horn-saluting cock-rocker called “Aero Zeppelin.” The band’s label, DGC, didn’t intend to promote Incesticide much, clearly considering it a low-stakes time-buying placeholder. Nirvana took advantage of that. Allegedly the band only put it out because Cobain got to make the devastating cover painting and pen the thousand-word essay for its legendary liner notes, which were an indictment of toxic masculinity, a corrective of the exploitative media, and an ode to the underground. Incesticide embodies the free space of punk more than any Nirvana album: part outsider visual art, part punk fanzine, thrillingly raw. It arrived at the end of a batshit year for Cobain and Courtney Love, who were married that February, just over a month after Nevermind hit its zenith, knocking Michael Jackson out of the No.1 spot on the Billboard charts. Their 1992 devolved from there. The press tortured the Cobains in the months leading up to the birth of their daughter; then followed a custody battle with Child Protective Services. It was the year Cobain wore a “Corporate Magazines Still Suck” shirt on the cover of Rolling Stone and a hand-drawn Flipper tee on “SNL.” By the end of 1992, he wanted to call the next Nirvana LP I Hate Myself and I Want to Die, which had become his standard response when asked, “How you doing?” Incesticide tells a different story: It forms a snapshot of Nirvana pre-Nevermind, the same band you see goofing around in a cha-cha line with Sonic Youth and dramatically eating grapes in David Markey’s classic tour doc 1991: The Year Punk Broke. In a hypothetical biopic of early Nirvana, these are the early songs that would soundtrack the deadpan humor of their ascent—ranging from ecstatic punk-pop to a maniacal, grinding noise, all united in crudity. Cobain felt Bleach was compromised because he had to avoid overtly poppy material in order to appeal to Sub Pop; he thought Nevermind’s slickness was “closer to Mötley Crüe record than it is a punk record,” embarrassing; and the confusion over the Steve Albini-helmed In Utero production is well documented. Incesticide has less baggage. No matter how gnarled the music gets, it inevitably feels lighter because when these songs were recorded, things were not yet so complicated. It’s humbling—as if Nirvana wished to shuttle back down to Earth and deliver the message, “We are not superhuman. We are passionately covering Devo.” The opening “Dive” and “Sliver” are Nirvana pantheon. The songs comprised the B- and A-sides of a classic pre-Nevermind single on Sub Pop, intended as a preview of their new poppier direction. (At the time of Incesticide, Sub Pop was planning its own Nirvana B-sides comp, allegedly to be called Cash Cow, but Geffen bought them out on that.) Cobain wanted “Sliver” to be “the most ridiculous pop song that [he] had ever written.” With its manic sideways hop and rudimentary harmonies, it is a hilarious caricature of one, containing the exaggerated naivete and cool simplicity of Olympia bands that Cobain loved, like Beat Happening and the Go Team. Our ’90s punk prophet revs through the words “ice cream” and “mashed potatoes,” giving voice to a boy who is left with his grandparents for a night, watching TV and feeling abandoned. Cobain said he got a K Records tattoo as a reminder “to stay a child,” and Nirvana never reached for that more than on “Sliver.” It was recorded in July ’90 when their Seattle peers Tad were on a dinner break from the studio; Mudhoney’s Dan Peters drummed. It took one hour and delightfully sounds like it. A complementary meditation on childhood, “Dive” finds Cobain begging “pick me pick me” and swiftly deducing that “everyone is hollow”—as if transforming, within seconds, into the demonic child he painted on Incesticide’s cover, a spirit already ravaged in youth. In the crests and punches and crashes of “Dive,” Cobain shows all the contours and shapes he could carve with his voice. “Dive in me,” he sings with the self-awareness that he will be analyzed. Like the best of Nirvana, “Dive” validates pain while tacitly pulling you out from beneath it, depressive and buoyant in each breath, making the sunken feeling soar. The unassuming “Stain,” similarly, is like a one-song Nirvana blueprint: When Cobain 180s from the lilting “staiiiin” into a metallic roar (“STAIN”), you can hear him working through all the seemingly disjointed sounds in his head—the brain that, in one early Nirvana bio, listed the nearly a capella indie band Young Marble Giants as an influence directly alongside Slayer. Not everything on Incesticide is of such life-affirming caliber, to be clear, but it’s all a blast to play. A blistering handful of its deep cuts are among Nirvana’s earliest songs: “Beeswax,” “Mexican Seafood,” “Hairspray Queen,” “Downer,” “Big Long Now,” and “Aero Zeppelin” were from their first demo, recorded January 23, 1988, with Seattle scene fixture Jack Endino. The demo was cut and mixed in one afternoon; Dale Crover of Melvins drummed, and Cobain paid the $152.44 studio bill with money from his janitor job. There’s a flash of spiraling, raging post-hardcore in “Downer” (a Bleach bonus track), but it is maybe generous to say there are a few duds among all this testosterone-fueled ennui. The lyrics to “Mexican Seafood” are plain nasty (index: “yeast infection,” “vomit,” “fleas”), the riffs prefab. As Cobain wrote in a press release about the amusingly irreverent “Aero Zeppelin”: “Christ! Let’s just throw together some heavy metal riffs in no particular order and give it a quirky name in homage to a couple of our favorite masturbatory ’70s rock acts.” It’s like the pop antagonists in Nirvana were trying to reveal themselves as unspectacular, to debunk the myth of male genius. Like any thoughtful punk, Cobain pondered anarchy. The “Smells Like Teen Spirit” video starred cheerleaders with anarchy-A jackets. The 1979 teen revenge fantasy film Over the Edge—which concludes with delinquent kids setting their school ablaze amid a PTA meeting—all but defined his personality. He considered selling Nevermind with radical-political essays. But the greatest manifestation of Cobain’s anarchic sensibility was undoubtedly in his commitment to dispersing his own power. He took any opportunity to diffuse the spotlight onto his lesser-known inspirations, shouting out dozens of bands in the Incesticide liner notes, on T-shirts, with opening slots, and especially via covers. Incesticide features three, all recorded on John Peel’s BBC show. Nirvana’s full-sprint take on Devo’s “Turn Around”—the B-side to “Whip It”—gave Cobain the chance to invoke Bob Dylan (“Who said don’t look back? Don’t believe em!”), and feels like a symbol of proud nerdiness. There are also two covers from Glasgow twee pop band the Vaselines, “Molly’s Lips” and “Son of a Gun.” The Vaselines are a band you’d worship if you were interested in deliberately unpopular culture, things that sweetly validate the wrongness in your life. Cobain loved the askew, droll, befuddlingly cheery Vaselines so much he named his daughter Frances after the band’s Frances McKee. That glee circulates through these sunny, arresting bits of high-wire noise-pop. To Cobain, punk was a synonym for freedom—bands that said life is cheap, eat the rich, fuck the police; bands on the margins, deliberate anti-virtuosos, like square pegs never to fit into a circular world. In the Incesticide liners, he wrote, “We just wanted to pay tribute to something [punk rock] that helped us to feel as though we had crawled out of the dung heap of conformity. To pay tribute like an Elvis or Jimi Hendrix impersonator in the tradition of a bar band.” Nirvana’s covers distilled that admirable ambition. In Cobain’s journals from this time, in between lyric drafts and notes to “call thurston,” there is one page that pops out, full of revolutionary zeal. In a letter to Bikini Kill drummer Tobi Vail, Cobain details his music-industry plot to infiltrate and subvert, to “sabotage the empire by pretending to play their game.” The piece reflects the influence of riot grrrl on his thinking. He writes, for example, about the hypocrisy of a school that teaches girls how to deal with rape culture instead of teaching boys about consent. He writes about how sexism had to be “blown wide open” in order to begin to “expand on all other –isms,” because no matter how you break it down, at the top still sits the white, corporate, irredeemable man. “It’s almost impossible to de-program the incestually-established, male oppressor, especially the ones who’ve been weaned on it thru their families...like die-hard NRA freaks and inherited corporate-power mongrels,” Cobain wrote. “But there are thousands of green minds, young gullible 15-year-old boys out there just starting to fall into the grain of what they’ve been told of what a man is supposed to be, and there are plenty of tools to use. The most effective tool is entertainment.” These are the seeds of how Kurt Cobain became the most famous punk feminist in music history: how he went on to play for millions of “MTV Unplugged” viewers while wearing a T-shirt for San Francisco band Frightwig (their 1984 debut included the pugnacious “My Crotch Does Not Say Go”), how a Nirvana benefit show raised $50,000 for Bosnian rape victims, how Cobain named their hit single after a phrase coined by Kathleen Hanna, how Nirvana posed for press photos in front of a public installation by conceptual artist Jenny Holzer broadcasting the insurrectionary message “MEN DON’T PROTECT YOU ANYMORE.” For years, I was put-off by how male Nirvana could sound. But when I consider their aero-zep leanings as bait for the boys that Cobain mentioned in his journals—when I hear his mission to “suck em in with quality entertainment and hit em with reality”—its weight registers clear as day. Incesticide collects some crucial, germinal entries of Nirvana’s feminism. The wound-up, savage, but emasculated lurch of “Beeswax” was originally released on the groundbreaking 1991 compilation Kill Rock Stars. How’s this for a mangled hook: “I got my dingaling spayed!” Kill Rock Stars was the first full-length music release on the foundational Olympia feminist punk label of the same name. It opened with Bratmobile’s sing-song “Girl Germs” (“You’re too cozy in your all-boy clubhouse!”) and placed Nirvana square in between a brooding Bikini Kill manifesto called “Feels Blind” (“Your world has taught me nothing”) and the fiery minimalism of Mecca Normal. Nirvana is tethered to the riot grrrl context, and the label certainly benefited from their contribution. Kill Rock Stars sold 25,000 copies; the label’s founder Slim Moon was able to release music by Bikini Kill and Unwound with the money. A feminist ethos also infused Cobain’s songwriting. The breezy pop-punk of Incesticide’s “Been a Son” tells the story of a girl whose parents wish she were born a boy—a comment on how patriarchy sees women as second-class citizens, on how it dictates what it thinks women should be. Nirvana placed the startling folk song “Polly” at the center of Nevermind, which appears on Incesticide as the plugged-in ripper “New Wave (Polly).” “Polly” was inspired by the horrific story of a 14-year-old girl who was kidnapped on her way home from a punk show at Tacoma’s Community World Theater (where Nirvana played early shows) in June of 1987, and brutally raped and tortured. As a slow, acoustic ballad, “Polly” insisted you hear its gruesome words. This lesser, compacted, neutrally-sung version was recorded on the BBC. “Polly” was originally titled “Hitchhiker” and, if not directly inspired by the 1978 song “Hitch Hike” by Swiss punks Kleenex (another Cobain favorite), then it is at least in a lineage with that earlier song, which is similarly about the price women can pay for adventures in public. On Incesticide, “Polly” includes a disturbing footnote: In 1991, a girl was raped by two men while they sang its lyrics, as the liner notes report. This sickened Cobain. “At this point I have a request for our fans,” he wrote to close the liners. “If any of you in any way hate homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor for us—leave us the fuck alone! Don’t come to our shows and don’t buy our records.” Punk is an open door; when Nirvana arrived at it, the entire world was on the other side. With the world hanging on their every word, Nirvana told the world to wake up or fuck off. The liner notes are the single most incisive document we have of the total intervention Nirvana staged on popular culture. Five hundred thousand people bought Incesticide within two months of its release, and in order to get to the life updates from Cobain, they had to first read 500 adoring words about the humble feminist punk band the Raincoats. Based in London, the Raincoats were only beginning to play their instruments upon forming in 1977; a quietly eccentric band who charged the air and hallowed ground in 1980s Olympia; who, like Nirvana, interpreted punk as a possibility, not one sound. Cobain bore a striking resemblance to Raincoats bassist Gina Birch—two punks with blonde mops of hair, drowning in shaggy mohair sweaters—bizarre, really. He wrote of his quest to find the Raincoats’ long out-of-print 1979 debut at the Rough Trade shop in London. A Rough Trade employee advised him to visit guitarist and singer Ana da Silva at her cousin’s antique shop, where she worked, and though Ana was busy, she offered to mail an LP over if she could find one lying around. In a few weeks, it came: “that wonderfully classic scripture,” as Cobain called The Raincoats. “It made me happier than playing in front of thousands of people each night, rock-god idolization from fans, music industry plankton kissing my ass, and the million dollars I made last year,” he wrote. “It was one of the few really important things that I’ve been blessed with since becoming an untouchable boy genius.” Books say Cobain was painfully shy; The Raincoats was introversion as punk. I hear traces of The Raincoats play out on Incesticide. “Polly” has a clear precedent in the UK band’s ominous “Off Duty Trip,” which similarly chronicled the rape of a woman by a soldier in a Northern Ireland park. Cobain evoked the seismic anguish of “The Void” every time he sang. And rarely have I heard a song capture the feeling of lovesickness with such nauseating truth as the Raincoats’ “In Love”—but the guttural churn of Nirvana’s “Aneurysm” comes close. The final track of Incesticide, “Aneurysm” is the apex of this compilation and Nirvana’s career. It is a shrill romantic exorcism, and like The Raincoats, it builds episodically: a tense, elongated, thrashing lead-in—each note like a glance over some deviant edge—giving way to the relief of just simmering drums, before an eruption of slashing noise and vulnerability. “Love you so much it makes me sick”—Cobain seems to curl his body around each syllable, the song’s guiding principle. What better word than aneurysm could describe the unpredictable, corporeal shock of infatuation that just dies? What makes the feeling dissolve? When Cobain beckons “Come on over and do the twist,” he evokes original teenage kicks, however cloaked in metaphor that may be. Nirvana’s dance craze is pogoing, which he incites. “Aneurysm” never fails to put the stupidest grin on my face, and I cannot hear it without flailing every inch of my body to its squirming emotional upheaval, without jerking my shoulders to its torrential feedback of the heart, as if succumbing to every knot and crevice of this punk song could save my life. At all the peaks of Incesticide, a Nirvana song is the same: music for outsiders among outsiders, a thread of connection among the disconnected, a friend screaming loud enough to reach inside your shell, empathic enough to ensure it doesn’t break.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nirvana-incesticide/,DGC,1992.0
18,John Coltrane,Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album,Jazz,8.6,June 30 2018,Ben Ratliff,Contributor,"From April 1962 to September 1965, while under contract to the record label Impulse!, John Coltrane led a more or less consistent working group with the same four musicians. After his death in 1967, this group—Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophone, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, Elvin Jones on drums—became known as Coltrane’s “classic quartet.” The group was powerful, elegant, and scarily deep. It was also a well-proportioned framing device. It made an artist with great ambitions easier to understand. It is possible to hear conviction and morality in some of the classic quartet’s best-known music—like the devotional A Love Supreme, recorded in late 1964—as clearly as you can hear melody or rhythm. As a consequence, all of it can appear set on one venerable plane. As it moves inexorably from ballads, blues, and folk songs into abstraction, the classic-quartet corpus can seem an index not only for the range of acoustic jazz but for possibly how to live, gathered and contained, as if it were always there. But the corpus is only what we have been given to hear. And then one day a closet door flies open, a stack of tapes fall out, and a dilemma begins. A fair amount of Coltrane’s music has been released after the fact, but nothing that would seem, from a distance, quite so canonical as Both Directions At Once, which is 90 minutes worth of (mostly) previously unheard recordings made at Rudy Van Gelder’s studio on March 6, 1963—the middle of the classic-quartet period. The Van Gelder studio, in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, can be considered part of the framing device. It was where the group did nearly all its studio work. For reasons of acoustics, it had a 39-foot-high, cathedral-like, vaulted wooden ceiling, fabricated by the same Oregon lumber company that made blimp hangars during World War II. Coltrane’s music during that period, possibly encouraged by the cathedral-like room, became blimpier and churchier. Why have we not heard these tapes before? It’s hard to imagine that they could have been blithely ignored or forgotten. The 2018 answer is that mono audition reels of the session were only recently found in the possession of the family of Coltrane’s first wife, Juanita Naima Coltrane. (Impulse! didn’t have the music; the label’s master tapes may have been lost in a company move from New York to Los Angeles.) The 1963 answer is unknown, and probably more complicated. Coltrane’s contract with Impulse! called for two records a year. Whether that day’s work in March was to be conceived at the time as a whole album, or most of one, is uncertain. The extent to which you believe the record’s subtitle—The Lost Album—might be the extent to which you are excited by the news of Both Directions. I can’t quite do it, but there are other reasons to be excited. It may be hard to hear as a coherent album for back then, though it is easy to hear it as one for now, in our current, expanded notion of what an album is. The music does not seem, in its context, to be a full step forward. It’s a little caught between shoring up and surging forth. (The after-the-fact title—alluding to a conversation Coltrane had with Wayne Shorter about the possibility of improvising as if starting a sentence in the middle, moving backward and forward simultaneously—helps turn a possible liability into a strength.) It can give you new respect for the rigor, compression, and balance of some of his other albums from the period. It is at times, as Coltrane’s son Ravi pointed out, surprisingly like a live session in a studio; parts of the music sound geared toward a captive audience. That may be the best thing about it. Included on the album—which comes either as a single-disc version or a double-disc with alternate takes, both including extensive liner notes by historian Ashley Kahn—is a sunny, bright-tempo melody (the theme from “Vilia,” written by the Hungarian composer Franz Lehár for the operetta The Merry Widow); a downtempo, minor-key, semi-standard (“Nature Boy,” from the book of eden ahbez, the California proto-hippie songwriter); one of Coltrane’s best original lines, in four different takes (“Impressions,” which he’d been working out in concert for several years); a couple of pieces for soprano saxophone which are representative but not stunning (“Untitled Original 11383,” minor-key and modal, and “Untitled Original 11386,” with a pentatonic melody); “One Up, One Down,” a short, wily theme as a pretext for eight minutes of hard-and-fast jamming; and “Slow Blues,” about which more in a minute. Coltrane was already building albums from disparate sessions, a practice that would soon yield 1963’s Impressions and Live at Birdland, two records that set live and studio tracks side by side. He may have been stockpiling without a clear purpose; he also had to consider what would sell. Since his recording of “My Favorite Things” in 1961—a hit by jazz terms—Coltrane had become recognizable. His subsequent working relationship with Bob Thiele, the head of Impulse!, was based on the notion that he could expand that audience, not shrink it. Six months before the Both Directions session, he’d made a record with Duke Ellington; the day after it, he’d make another with the singer Johnny Hartman. He was entering the popular artist’s paradox of striving to repeat a past success and trying not to run aground on retreads. The sense of strength and inevitability we associate with Coltrane’s music didn’t just tumble out. It was likely a byproduct of diligence, restlessness, exhausted possibilities, obsession and counter-obsession. He thought about progress. He passed through serial phases of exploring harmonic sequences, modes, and multiple rhythms; when he acknowledged one phase in an interview, he was generally looking for the next. At the height of the classic quartet, he often didn’t have the time or psychic space for study and practice. “I’m always walking around trying to keep my ear open for another ‘Favorite Things’ or something,” he told the writer Ralph Gleason in May, 1961. “I can’t get in the woodshed like I used to. I’m commercial, man.” More: “I didn’t have to worry about it, you know, making a good record, because that wasn’t important. Maybe I should just go back in the woodshed and just forget it.” At the time, a record like Both Directions might have seemed an open admission that he could have used less worry and more woodshed. What he meant by “another ‘Favorite Things’” might have been a similar act of counterintuition: a sweet, sentimental tune made paranormal, a curiosity that could break out beyond the normal jazz audience and anchor a hit record. If “Vilia” was intended for that role, it isn’t strong enough. “Impressions,” on Both Directions, in its first known studio recording—especially take 3—sounds sublimely focused. But I’m not sure Coltrane plays it here any better than he did sixteen months earlier at the Village Vanguard, the live version he’d choose later in 1963 when finally issuing the tune, on the record of that name. (It’s complicated, I know.) “Slow Blues” is the one. There is no narrative here, as there sometimes was with Coltrane’s originals; it is not expressly about love or hardship or religious joy. But Coltrane turns himself inside-out. First, he phrases in bare, hesitant strokes, using negative space; then he begins to whip phrases around, repeating them up and down the horn in rapid, shinnying patterns, reaching for inexpressible sounds, getting ugly. (McCoy Tyner’s solo, directly following Coltrane’s, is tidy and elegant, thorough in its own radically contrasting way.) There is the idea of the “new,” and then there is something like this track, which transcends the burden of newness. I imagine three possible problems someone might have had with putting “Slow Blues” on a record in 1963. One is that, at 11 and a half minutes, it would have taken up a third of the record. Two is that a long blues probably wouldn’t be properly commercial unless there was some sort of story attached to it. And three is that, as was the case with “Impressions,” “Slow Blues” doesn’t explicitly show progress. Hear Coltrane on the long, slow “Vierd Blues” from the Sutherland Hotel in Chicago in 1961. It’s not great sound quality, but it is great in every other way. “Slow Blues” grows from the same root. It’s no “better,” really, but it’s better to have more of it, and better recorded. It is possible to take in Both Directions At Once, some of it middling by Coltrane’s standards and some of it extraordinary by anyone’s, without much thought about sellability or progress. In an ideal case, both qualities are overrated anyway. This is an ideal case.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-coltrane-both-directions-at-once-the-lost-album/,Impulse!,2018.0
19,Gorillaz,The Now Now,"Electronic,Rock",6.8,June 29 2018,Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,"At 50, Damon Albarn is still writing songs for the world’s most popular cartoon band because he believes in the romantic idea that an international charting group can change the world. Cartoons appeal to young people, which makes illustrator and co-founder Jamie Hewlett’s multicultural avatars—2-D, Russel, Noodle, the “imprisoned” Murdoc, and stand-in bassist Ace—a Trojan horse for the kind of politics that people prefer not to hear from millionaires. The records range from eco-centric protests to dystopian party playlists, all full of Albarn’s auteur charm and a faint scent of calculation, as if they’d been executive-produced by a bohemian pop-cultural think tank. It’s hard to resent someone as melodically adept as Albarn, or so obviously in love with their work. On The Now Now—Gorillaz’s second album in two years, and Albarn’s fourth in five—he writes simple, mostly upbeat songs with words of exhaustion. Adrift from the group’s grand concepts, this is their least ambitious and most plainly enjoyable music in years: written on tour, hashed out by Albarn and Hewlett at their studios, and recorded in the space of a month. It is, in the band’s telling, a solo album by Albarn’s character 2-D. It sounds, to the less imaginative, like an outlet for the daydream funk, playful psych-pop, and upscale disco that presumably soundtrack Albarn’s rare days off. When Gorillaz records do grate, it’s usually thanks to a kind of sarcastic opulence, as if they’d been dictated by a man in a poolside recliner who won’t put down his iPad. Even when they’re on form, there’s something not quite right about their version of pop. The album opens with “Humility,” which sounds like an A.I.-generated summer bop: basslines bounce, synths rush, and George Benson riffs frolic like dragonflies. Everything is in its right place, yet the tune, as well as plenty here like it, conjures the ennui that descends when you finally arrive at the beach and wonder, Is this it? It is. The Now Now is programmed fun, the affable kind that never threatens to whisk you away, but its wrongness is oddly compelling and part of Gorillaz’s world-building dexterity. The Now Now succeeds partly because of its scarce guest list (Snoop Dogg and Jamie Principle, on “Hollywood,” are the only vocal features), relative to last year’s overstuffed Humanz. The allure of isolation defines the record—Albarn wrote it in penthouse hotel rooms—and the motif fits his themes of modern politics and technology. “Calling the world from isolation,” the album begins, a mantra that shape-shifts to allude to Brexit, gun laws, and other political specters. It’s handy that these themes are, with Albarn’s light touch, mostly interchangeable, because they later become entangled with the subplot of a sabotaged relationship. “Baby I just survived, I got drunk, I’m sorry, am I losing you,” he groans on “Fire Flies,” a come-back plea that might as well be Britain sending a rueful late-night text to the EU. After endless observational laments, it’s a welcome personal flourish, albeit undermined by plodding space-funk that’s barely more convincing than its penitent narrator. Given his penchant for the music of Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it’s fascinating that Albarn remains such a sucker for generic pop-house and boom-bap beats. Gorillaz may be the only band in the world that could be improved by Diplo: Their rhythmic homogeneity—along with the space-station filters on Albarn’s already glum vocals—sometimes keeps these otherwise masterful pop confections grounded. Often the best songs are, accordingly, the folksiest, like “Souk Eye” and “One Percent,” fingerpicked acoustic numbers embellished by android whirrs and longing synths. They might have populated a follow-up to Everyday Robots, Albarn’s 2014 solo LP, were it not for their fairytale twinkle—the sense that everything is at once awful and full of magic, a quality that animates all of Gorillaz’s most apocalyptically pretty work. Albarn had a shot at rehabilitating his languid balladry on Everyday Robots, his first latter-career album to let his melancholy just exist without ornamentation. The cartoon band can catch you off guard like that, in a summer pop playlist or a branch of Urban Outfitters, which makes the project, in a strange way, a more suitable solo concern than Albarn’s proper solo work. He’s his own institution now, neither a dilettante nor a polymath, comparable to none, still with a schoolboy eye for the absurd and an interest in almost everything. It might be too humble for its own good, but The Now Now is the rare commercial sojourn that feels like a product of real fascination.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gorillaz-the-now-now/,Parlophone,2018.0
20,Nas,Nasir,Rap,6.1,June 20 2018,Stephen Kearse,Contributor,"It’s hard to discern whether Nasir was even Nas’ idea. When Kanye West announced he’d be producing it, it felt like a personal milestone for him more than a fleshed-out collaboration. Nas clearly obliged, but it’s hard to imagine Nasir is the album Nas bragged about on the 2016 DJ Khaled song “Nas Album Done.” The record was not done at the time that track was released, but the sheer brashness of Nas treating a completed album like a plutonium cache indicated that he was feeling himself. But on Nasir, even as he tackles classic Nas subjects like police brutality, managing money, and conspiracy theories, a noxious cloud hangs over everything: Nas is bored. He opens the album with the perfunctory enthusiasm of a waiter describing the daily special to her 30th table that night. “Escobar season begins,” he says flatly, quickly passing the mic to Diddy, whose raucous presence, by contrast, is immediately felt. A sped-up loop of the main theme of The Hunt for Red October gives “Not for Radio” some cinematic and regal flair, but Nas lumbers through his verses. Weaving together outsized paranoia (“They try to Hyman Roth me/John Fitzgerald me”), textbook hotepisms (“Black Kemet gods, Black Egyptian gods/Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard”), and boilerplate faux-deep commentary (“Shoot the ballot box, no voter cards, they are all frauds”), he builds to a doofy litany of falsehoods and unsolicited history lessons. On the surface, lines like “Fox News was started by a black dude” (it wasn’t) and “Edgar Hoover was black” (he wasn’t) are standard Nas soapboxing; messianic titles aside, Nas has very rarely claimed to be anything other than one guy trying to move the masses by sharing what he believes. But there’s an emptiness to these provocations. Nas sounds less like a street preacher touting with conviction and urgency, and more like an online commenter shitposting in search of a jolt of entropy. It’s not quite trolling, but there’s an abandon to his claims, a lack of consideration. It’s lazy writing. “Cops Shot the Kid,” a bouncy track built around a rickety sample of Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” is more purposeful. Nas flits between irritation and resignation as he chronicles the dread and terror of being black in America. He’s been on this beat since he rebuked a “foul cop” who shot an allegedly unarmed man on Illmatic’s “Halftime,” and you can feel the history in his voice. “Y’all are blowing my high,” he laments as cops circle around some city kids enjoying a hacked fire hydrant. The song falters when Kanye dips in to detail the “other side” of cops killing black kids. Whereas Nas’ verse had setting, character, and mise en scene, Kanye’s is all stage directions. “I know every story got two sides,” he raps to the clouds. It’s clear which side he wants to empathize with, but considering his recent comments about slavery and his sloppy verse on Pusha-T’s Daytona (“Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?”), his verse is distracting. The fact that it wasn’t cut feels negligent. It’s easy to pin this lack of focus on Kanye’s domineering vision of Nas, but Nas never really demands the spotlight. Abandoning the keen eye for details that he honed from his famous project window perch, Nas instead offers bland reports from the Met Gala and somewhere in the south of France; his narratives have the excitement of a geo-tag. Luxury items, artisanal foods, and women are rendered crudely, without flourish or even appetite. “Having drinks in Vegas, my business,” he boasts on “Bonjour,” the beverage and the business omitted. When Nas does find inspiration, his passion is outrageously misplaced. “Everything,” the centerpiece of the album, is essentially a bizarro version of “If I Ruled the World” where, instead of outlining a black utopia, Nas rails against… child vaccinations, inclusion, and the ghosts of rich white people. “If I had everything, everything/I could change anything,” Kanye croons, driving home the aimlessness of the song. They covet the power to shape the world, but not the responsibility. In the rare moments where Nasir achieves coherence, Nas is often concerned with the precarity of his successes. “Adam and Eve” and “Simple Things” contain multiple allusions to loss, longevity, and humiliation. Nas frets often about his children missing out on his gains, and his own peace of mind being threatened by his indiscretions or generational trauma. Kelis’ recent allegations of abuse during her marriage to Nas can make these nods to broken families and debts feel like elisions and barbs, but that is probably too generous. The writing is so meandering and mechanical that little here feels intentional, even the gaps. And strangely, that’s the bittersweet takeaway: Nas the meticulous observer has been supplanted by Nas the nervous rambler. It doesn’t feel like an accident.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nas-nasir/,Mass Appeal,2018.0
21,Neko Case,Hell-On,Folk/Country,7.7,June 5 2018,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"For all of Neko Case’s masterfully delivered tales of killer animals and sentient weather patterns, her decades of work have revealed an increasingly human worldview where mercy is shown only to those who deserve it. She sings of bloodshed and mystery and revenge, but in her albums there are also pleas for basic compassion that are intimate and deeply felt. “I’m a man,” she sang in a definitive lyric from her strikingly personal album from 2013, The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight. “It’s what kind of animal I am.” Five years later, Case returns with Hell-On, her most collaborative release to date, featuring pop producer Björn Yttling (of Peter, Bjorn and John), gruff-voiced alt-rock veterans Mark Lanegan and Eric Bachmann, and bandmates from the New Pornographers and case/lang/veirs (k.d. Lang and Laura Veirs). The added company is felt throughout: No other album in her catalog is so musically rich and orchestrated. Its eclectic nature sometimes takes the spotlight from Case’s inimitable alto—usually the central force of her records—but it also highlights the unmistakable identity of her writing. As the scenery shifts, Case spends these songs siphoning wisdom from horror and searching for connection amid human cruelty and chaos. “Be careful of the natural world,” she cautions in the opening title track. You’d be wise to take her advice. If there’s a theme running through the record’s dense, disparate tracks, it’s confronting primal fears head-on. In a deceptively upbeat song called “My Uncle’s Navy,” she includes a trigger warning: “If you’re tender-hearted, you should stop the tape.” Then, she recounts an early trauma about a relative mutilating animals to scare young girls. Case revisits the scene from various angles, questioning the adults who could have stopped him and analyzing the way sadism evolves when left unchecked. “Bullies are not born, they are pressed into a form,” she reflects. What remains so disturbing to her isn’t the violence so much as the way it can be imposed upon us, without consent or explanation, at a formative age. Hell-On doesn’t carry the autobiographical precision of The Worse Things Get. Its songs are knottier and more elliptical. While more uptempo tracks like the righteous “Last Lion of Albion” and the loping dust storm of “Dirty Diamond” lack the effortless drive of her old power-pop numbers, they make up for it in texture. Hell-On’s many moving parts invoke a wide palette of fragmented follow-up albums: the arrangements on Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk that sounded like three different bands playing (and breaking up) at once; the moments on Destroyer’s Poison Season that seemed pieced together from shattered remains of pop standards. Hell-On is a record that can feel equally fragile and impenetrable, its songs like complex universes connected only by proximity. Case’s gift as a songwriter has long been her ability to burrow small moments into your consciousness: She finds resonance in simple, ambiguous phrases—“I’m free to covet all I please,” “You never held it at the right angle”—where other artists build hooks out of their most universal insights. Here, these mystifying lines come packed together more tightly in songs that rarely cover the same ground twice. At some point during the nautical waltz of “Winnie,” Beth Ditto comes center stage to sing the most triumphant chorus to ever appear on a Neko Case record—the aural equivalent of a celebratory group hug after a decathlon. “We were warriors,” she belts with just the right amount of ceremony. But that melody never recurs, and by the end of the song, Case is back alone at the microphone singing in a quiet, mournful coo. Stories are more exciting, she discovers, when every part is not treated like its climax. During the recording of Hell-On, Case endured a series of calamities. First, her house burned down. (Thankfully, no one—including the myriad animals she cares for—was injured.) Next, a journalist included her name and address in a news report about the fire: a terrifying prospect, considering Case was dealing with a stalker at the time. These events are never addressed directly in the lyrics, but the ongoing struggle darkens the record. Feelings of fear and exhaustion seep through nearly every song. On a previous album, the karmic apocalypse in “Bad Luck,” with its punchline, “So I died and went to work,” might be a moment of levity. Here, it sprawls uneasily and cycles through peppy, crowded verses that start to feel like a compulsion. In other tracks, she gives the microphone over entirely to her accompanists, retreating momentarily in their presence. “You are beautiful and you are alone,” went a borrowed mantra on her last album. Hell-On takes the opposite angle: As ugly as things get, at least we have each other. With this outlook, Case is empowered. In the dazzling ballad “Halls of Sarah,” she sings, “Our poets do an odious business loving womankind/As lions love Christians.” Through these songs, she attempts to correct the poets, scavenging for what she refers to as “the warmth of your species,” some common kindness uniting us. While writing this record, Case took inspiration from Adrienne Mayor’s The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World, a thoroughly researched book that offers proof of a long-ignored civilization. Hell-On, with its embattled stories and restless spirit, comforts by offering a similar affirmation: The myth is all the more beautiful and strange if it’s real.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/neko-case-hell-on/,Anti-,2018.0
22,Aretha Franklin,Spirit in the Dark,Pop/R&B,9.0,May 20 2018,Nick Marino,,"Professionally speaking, Aretha Franklin had nothing left to prove. She’d shaken off a slow start in the music business after squandering years of her prime singing schlocky jazz on Columbia Records for a producer who once said, with a straight face, “My vision for Aretha had nothing to do with rhythm and blues.” She’d cemented her legend with “Respect,” a minor Otis Redding track that she elevated to a social-justice masterpiece. She’d established her voice as one of the 20th Century’s most distinctive instruments, right up there with Louis Armstrong’s trumpet. On a personal level, it was another story. She had sung two years prior at the funeral of her family friend Martin Luther King Jr., and his assassination had left her shaken. She had recently separated from her husband and manager, Ted White, a volatile svengali who’d transitioned into the music business after a stint as a pimp. And she was already carrying another man’s child—her fourth, having become pregnant the first time at age 12, just two years after her own mother dropped dead of a heart attack. Through this trauma came Spirit, a cathartic 1970 testimonial documenting the fusion of house-wrecking gospel and gut-wrenching soul that made Aretha Franklin Aretha Franklin. It is not her most famous record. It is not her top-selling record. What it is is her truest record, the one that best captures her essential ache—the pain of a black woman clamoring for freedom from the domineering men who suffocated her childhood, manipulated her career, mangled her personal life, and more broadly speaking oppressed her race and robbed her dignity. It’s an assertion of personhood, a monument to resilience in the face of pain. As if to make all this explicit she closes the album with a cover of B.B. King’s “Why I Sing the Blues,” though when it finally arrives the song is redundant. If you’ve been listening, you already know why. Franklin grew up in Detroit playing piano and singing in church for her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin, a powerful Baptist preacher so charismatic that nurses carried smelling salts to revive parishioners overcome by his word. The reverend’s sanctuary sat on Hastings Street, which at the time was Detroit’s black entertainment district, home to the bars where blues legend John Lee Hooker used to gig. The Franklin home was itself a kind of private club, a place for musicians like Nat Cole and Dinah Washington to relax after hours. Knowing he had a prodigy in the house, Franklin’s father used to wake her in the middle of the night and trot her out to perform for his tipsy guests. The parties gave young Franklin an early lesson in the ways sacred and secular life commingled. At age 18, Franklin turned pro and embarked on a quest to integrate the passions and inflections—the blackness—of gospel music with the bourgeois politesse of the white pop charts. Columbia thought she could compete with Barbra Streisand. Franklin agreed, as did her new husband and manager. Ted White was a man with a huge square head, a taste for custom suits, and a temper. Etta James once compared his relationship with Franklin to Ike Turner’s with Tina. White insisted that his young bride tour and record constantly; between 1961 and 1970, she released 19 studio albums. After years without a breakthrough on Columbia, White did manage to orchestrate Franklin’s 1966 move to the R&B-minded Atlantic Records, where she began her torrential creative streak with 1967’s I Never Loved a Man, but by then their relationship had frayed. In 1969, the two divorced. Restraining orders were filed. At one point, enraged that Sam Cooke’s brother Charles had visited Franklin at home, White pulled a gun and shot him in the crotch. The outside world provided no safe haven. Violence rained all around her. King was murdered in Memphis in the spring of 1968. A few months later, Franklin performed the national anthem at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, only to see it engulfed in riots. A few months after that, almost 150 people were arrested and one police officer killed during a black-power congregation at her father’s Detroit church. Released after this period of profound turmoil for her country, her career, her race, and her family, Spirit in the Dark stands as a statement of triumph for having come through, survived, gotten over. Franklin doesn’t make it look easy; she reminds us that it’s difficult. The LP’s very first cut, “Don’t Play That Song,” is all about trying and failing to forget old hurt. The grainy black-and-blue cover photo resembles nothing more than a bruise. She recorded most of the album in Florida, and still today it sounds so steamy you have to crack a window. Most artists start their careers rough and eventually smooth out; Franklin went the other direction, rasping her voice, heading from slick cosmopolitan Detroit all the way down below the Mason-Dixon line. In an exquisite North-meets-South anecdote that became music-industry lore, at one point during the Spirit sessions, Franklin spilled a bag of pig’s feet in the lobby of Miami’s posh Fontainebleau hotel and refused to pick it up. Her band hailed from across the region. On electric guitar: Duane Allman, the virtuoso longhair just a year away from fatally crashing his motorcycle back home in Georgia. On organ, bass, and drums: the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, a squad of Alabama ringers who’d cut their teeth with Wilson Pickett and Percy Sledge. Singing backup: Almeda Lattimore, Margaret Branch, and Franklin’s cousin Brenda Bryant, a trio that could mimic a Mississippi tent-revival choir. And then on piano: the 27-year-old soul queen herself. It’s easy to forget—because her voice makes us forget—that Franklin has always been a formidable pianist. But she could hang with anybody. “Don’t Play That Song” opens with her at the keys, thumping out chords. The second track, “The Thrill Is Gone (From Yesterday’s Kiss),” begins exactly the same way. In all, seven of the album’s dozen songs start with the sound of her piano summoning a divine vibration, making her seem like both the bandleader and minister of her own personal tabernacle. In contrast with Sam Cooke, who left faith music in the dust when he crossed over to pop, Franklin found ways to bring the genres together. Spirit in the Dark embodies the synthesis. “You and Me” is either an ode to monogamy or a devotional to the Lord. The ecstatic title track is either a paean to the holy ghost or a first-person account of a rafter-shaking orgasm. If you’re not paying attention, “Try Matty’s” sounds like it could be a joyful hymn. It’s a hymn alright—to a barbecue joint. The effect isn’t so much about ambiguity, making us guess which thing she really means. Aretha Franklin is more about duality, making us believe both things at the same time. Three-and-a-half minutes into “The Thrill Is Gone,” as Franklin contemplates emancipation from a soured relationship, her choir kicks in to “thank God almighty, I’m free at last.” Suddenly the song is enlarged. And yet somehow exhuming MLK doesn’t make “Thrill” any less of a breakup song. If anything it becomes more of one, equating the emotional wreckage of failed romance with a nation’s collective grief over a national tragedy. Intimate loss can be all-encompassing, the song suggests, and all-encompassing loss can be acutely intimate. The goodbyes don’t stop there. “Like the dew on the mountain,” Franklin sings, “like the foam way out on the sea, like the bubbles on the fountain—you’re gone forever from me.” That’s a little number called “One Way Ticket,” and it’s supposed to be one of the happy songs. When decoding so much material about regret and liberation, it’s impossible not to read into Franklin’s personal life. And yet at a certain point, her music—like all music—is less about the specific content and more about the general feeling. It’s the relief we all get when finally moving on from something bad, the exhaustion and exaltation. It’s the masochism of being glad for the pain, because pain is how we know what we had was real. It’s the euphoria Franklin conveys in “Pullin’,” co-written by her sister Carolyn before she died of cancer at age 43. The words come off as an open letter to an ex-lover. The music comes off as a jamboree. Again the tune opens with Franklin’s piano. Again she sings a gospel melody, climbing and dipping and wailing. Again she calls to her backup singers and they respond to her, and again, and again, and soon the tempo is racing so fast that the song lifts off its foundation to become a kind of divine dialogue we don’t so much listen to as a witness. “Pulling,” she sings. “Harder. Higher. Harder. Higher. Pulling. Moving. Pulling. Harder! Pulling. Higher! Moving. Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Go ahead! Higher!” The woman will not quit. She’s broken free now, free of the earth and its chains. She’s ascending to heaven, pulling harder, lifting higher until she levitates in a state of transcendence, still singing, still wailing, crying out to God and man alike in a joyful noise borne of suffering. She continues like this until her formidable band, by now apparently crippled with fatigue, stumbles to a halt. A hi-hat shimmers, a kick-drum thuds, and then in one of the great mic drops of all time, the diva Aretha Franklin, returned to earth now in a state of grace, turns to her sidemen—or maybe directly to us—and utters a single word: “Well?”",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aretha-franklin-spirit-in-the-dark/,Atlantic,1970.0
23,Leon Bridges,Good Thing,Pop/R&B,7.2,May 8 2018,Olivia Horn ,Contributor ,"Leon Bridges never set out to be a nostalgia act. Growing up in the ’90s, he was devoted to the R&B of Usher and Ginuwine and his earliest performances at open-mic nights in his native Fort Worth were of neo-soul songs sketched out over readymade beats. Though his debut album, 2015’s Coming Home, was a study of early ’60s soul music written at the altar of Sam Cooke, Bridges strives to be considered among his contemporaries as well as his forebears. He’s shared bills with One Direction expats, appeared on songs with Macklemore and ODESZA, and popped up in a music video with Portland rapper Aminé. Perceived obligation pulled Bridges into the fold of traditional soul music, he’s said: As a young singer considering the profound legacy of black musicians like Cooke and his peers, Bridges felt compelled to pay them homage. If Coming Home was a remittance of dues, then, Bridges’ sophomore album, Good Thing, is a widening of horizons. His music remains broadly “retro” with a veil of analog fuzz built into the tracks, horn licks and references to the American South, and those buttery, laid-back vocal runs that drew a line from Bridges to his idol in the first place. But his temporal fixation has loosened, making room for a more elastic, eclectic approach to songwriting that feels perfectly contemporary. This new adventurousness is most apparent in songs like “If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be)” and “You Don’t Know.” The former, a flirty, guitar-heavy funk number with a winsome opening line about being hotter than Texas, reveals its affinity for pop with plummy string synth and a bouncy four-count intro that tips its hat to Pharrell. Right on its heels, the equally upbeat “You Don’t Know” pairs Bridges’ dreamy falsetto with a boisterous disco track. These are the first entries in Bridges’ catalog that are, without question, meant for dancing, full of hints that he’s gunning for a spot in the same pop radio pantheon that he worshipped as a kid. In this pursuit, producer Ricky Reed—who in the past year has worked with Kesha, Maroon 5, and DNCE—is a worthy partner. It’s easy to point to Bridges’ major label credentials and call his crossover a commercial ploy, but with his upper-range theatrics and ineffable charisma, he makes a convincing pop vocalist. The biggest payoffs on Good Thing aren’t born of its highest-energy moments, but of the tender touches in Bridges’ voice. Part of Coming Home’s charm was its leading man’s sweet, simple take on romance. Bridges wanted nothing more than to be a better man for his baby, to swim the Mississippi River to prove his love—heartwarming, if quaint-sounding, sentiments. On Good Thing, Bridges has kept his heart on his sleeve but updated his parlance to something a little less affected, a little more believable. On standout single “Beyond,” he gushes about seeing his partner’s face in the light of day, not just her body at night. On “Forgive You,” a stunning, sweeping offering of absolution, he captures the exquisitely affecting memory of sliding a pillow under his sleeping lover’s head. “Shy,” a lovely slow-burner, meets introversion with patience and compassion. And notably, on this record, Bridges spares us the euphemisms when it comes to sex: “Sometimes I wonder what we’re holding on for/Then you climb on top of me and I remember,” he sings on “Mrs.” He remains the gentleman and doesn’t elaborate much further—but it’s clear that what he’s singing about here is real love, both the physical and the emotional of it, where before he was caught up in the idea of courtship. And while Bridges may still harbor old-school fantasies about wifing and child-rearing (“Will she have my kids/Will she be my wife?” he wonders aloud on “Beyond”), he’s speaking about them in language that feels like his own, instead of in words borrowed from generations past. That authenticity makes the difference between songs that are charming and songs that are genuinely moving. For Bridges, it’s the difference between being an act and being an artist.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/leon-bridges-good-thing/,"LisaSawyer63,Columbia",2018.0
24,Post Malone,Beerbongs & Bentleys,Rap,5.6,May 3 2018,Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,"At his Coachella set this year, Post Malone indulged in a little score-settling. He ran down some of the insults his critics hurled at him early in his career—“one-hit wonder,” “culture vulture,” “piece of shit”—during a heated rant that boiled down to: Look at me now. He certainly has reason to gloat. With his recent hits, he’s not only vanquished any lingering notion that his breakout single “White Iverson” was a fluke, but proven himself one of the most perceptive figures in pop right now, an artist with a better understanding of commercial winds than even most of the rappers he cribs from. Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, and their peers may have ushered in rap’s current rock-star era, but none have run quite as far with the premise as Post Malone. For Post, “rock star” is less a genre signifier and more a declaration of mass appeal. His music is melodic trap, mostly, yet its rugged sensitivity is so universal that much of it could slot into rock or even country playlists, too. He only rarely uses guitars, but they’re often implied. And while there isn’t so much a hint of twang on his stature-cementing sophomore album, Beerbongs & Bentleys, based on his guttural, belted delivery on opener “Paranoid,” it’s not a stretch to imagine him doffing a cowboy hat for a cheering arena. Twenty years after Whitey Ford sang the blues, this Bud Light-loving party animal with a gold grill and Willie Nelson braids has rewritten the rules of gravity for a crooning white rapper. With its impassive descriptions of womanizing, pill-popping, and property destruction, Post’s smash 2017 single “rockstar” sets the tone for Beerbongs & Bentleys. “Party going in with the threesome/Raw dog, prolly have three sons,” he raps on “Takin’ Shots.” On the champagne-clinking Swae Lee feature “Spoil My Night,” Post points out which woman he wants his handlers to deliver to him like he’s a diner at a lobster tank (“I ain’t even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies,” he enthuses). If Beerbongs’ hotel trashing, groupie-banging brand of debauchery sometimes feels like a throwback to the Mötley Crüe days, that may be deliberate: Tommy Lee even drums on “Over Now,” a rare overture to the rock fans Post Malone otherwise mostly courts with dog whistles. The difference between rap’s current class of rock stars and the archetypal rock stars of the ’80s, of course, is that serious rappers aren’t allowed to enjoy their stardom. Success is a burden, modern rap songwriting conventions insist, and Post is never less convincing than when he fans the notion that he, too, resents his fame, as if it were possible that anybody who scaled the industry so purposefully never volunteered for it. At his nadir, Drake pushed his fame’s toll tropes to the point of self-parody, but even he never wrote a song as naked in its messaging as “Rich & Sad.” At times it’s almost impressive how long an album called Beerbongs & Bentleys can go without cracking a smile. It is more assured and impressive than its predecessor, Stoney, but it’s also more exhausting. At 64 minutes, it repeats itself quite a bit, both thematically and sonically. Post has learned to do more with his voice, but he does it too much: He sings like a contestant on “The Voice” pleading not to be cut, overplaying every ache, quiver, and twitch. Especially in the album’s dour, mostly guest-free final stretch, it’s hard not to feel crushed under the weight of his undulating Adam’s apple. The irony is Post sounds best when he isn’t trying quite so hard. “Rockstar” and its follow-up single “Psycho” have an ease to them, an unlikely grace. Each pairs the rapper with a spacious, unhurried beat and simply gives him room to ponder thoughts and chew syllables. It’s hardly a profound formula, but it plays to Post’s greatest strength: his melodic instincts. His best hooks are so tuneful and airless they directly target the ear’s pleasure centers. Too often, though, Beerbongs overplays its hand, twisting potentially breezy songs into something false and performative. For an artist whose secret weapon is his light touch, Post Malone lays it on mighty thick.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/post-malone-beerbongs-and-bentleys/,Republic,2018.0
25,J. Cole,KOD,Rap,6.3,April 24 2018,Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,"Listening to a J. Cole album can feel like listening to a very intense young lawyer attempt to win a difficult case. Throughout his career, Cole’s raps have often been self-serious and polemical, with their success depending on the overall strength of his argumentation above all else. And while many of his individual claims can be convincing, you often get to the end of a song and think something like: Wait, did he really just argue that corporations take taxes and use them to buy and spread guns? Few artists stake so much on their ability to persuade an audience of their worldview, particularly when that worldview is so absolutist. You do not listen to J. Cole to enjoy his wit or his stories, but to partake in his wisdom, which often involves an element of moral panic: On his new addiction-themed album, KOD, he loves to suggest that people should abstain from things—smoking, drinking, online dating. Sometimes, he’s persuasive, but just as often, he simply seems self-righteous. For a talented technical rapper with reverence for hip-hop’s history, Cole has never really been playful. (His previous album, 4 Your Eyez Only, was all about death.) Aside from his weakness for corny punchlines, his verses are frequently free of the word games that his top-tier peers revel in. But even so, Cole is capable of making a strong case for his beliefs. When he does, it’s thanks to the emotional appeals he embeds in certain songs. On “FRIENDS,” he confesses to his dependence on weed before calling out specific friends who abuse drugs; in asking them to stop, he mostly ditches his sanctimony. On another standout, “Kevin’s Heart,” Cole uses the pint-sized comedian’s very public infidelities to reflect on the challenge of monogamy: “My phone be blowing up/Temptations on my line/I stare at the screen a while before I press decline.” Cole is most effective when he keeps things personal rather than turning up his nose at the choices of others. Other songs work because of the North Carolina rapper’s technical ability and skill behind the boards. Previously, when Cole has wanted to make a statement, he’s asked all collaborators to leave the room. The new album, like his would-be magnum opus, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, is absent of other artists (save kiLL edward, a mysterious guest whose voice, when sped up, sounds like J. Cole’s), and Cole produced much of it himself. “ATM” and the title track are potent reminders of the way he can rip up a song with his flow alone. Cole is friends with Kendrick Lamar, and KOD, with its stripped-down production, snare-drum flows, and focus on virtue and vice, can feel like a pale shadow of DAMN. Unlike the Pulitzer winner, Cole is far more predictable and accessible. Cole simplifies lust on “Photograph,” where he again reminds us that his ideal woman is a holy Madonna who is sexy but never shows too much skin. He’s thoughtlessly proud on “The Cut Off,” in which he commends himself for his generosity after talking about how tempted he is to become violent. And on “BRACKETS,” he boils down a complicated topic in order to make a difficult argument work. The song ends with the story of a mother who loses her son. On the day of her son’s funeral, she remembers she has to pay her taxes, which she believes indirectly funded his death. Much like DAMN., the song uses the cyclical nature of time to make a point—that taxes are evil. But unlike Kendrick, Cole jury-rigs the narrative to make his case. Specious as they may be, songs like “BRACKETS” help us understand Cole’s appeal: He unites his audience against bogeymen like taxes, or the government, or white teachers in black schools, or a new generation of rappers. If you agree that those things are unequivocally Bad, you might be willing to listen when he tells you what not to do. The most personal song on KOD is about his mother, Kay, and it combines the emotional appeal and evocative detail of the album’s best tracks with the selfishness of its worst. On “Once an Addict (Interlude),” Cole recalls his mom drinking too much after his stepfather had a child by another woman—even pinpointing the Marvin Gaye and Al Green songs she was listening to at the time—as he regrets his own callous reaction (“Why she always using me for a crutch?”). But while those elements make the song powerful, Cole expresses a surprising lack of empathy for his mother’s troubles, even with the benefit of hindsight, and is hamstrung by clumsy lines (“Maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals”). Listeners are asked to think about the rapper’s pain, rather than his mother’s. Kay has encouraged her younger son to use her struggles as a warning to others, which he has done in the past. But there’s more to her story. She worked hard raising two sons by herself, working as a mail carrier to the point where her feet ached. One of those sons became a successful rapper, bought her a house, granted her the opportunity to stop carrying mail and to pursue acting, to meet Barack Obama and Afeni Shakur. In its haste to show the ugliness of her addiction KOD’s portrait of her glosses over any and all explanatory or redemptive details. It misses many other things too, when it conflates healthy and abusive self-medication, or refuses to make a distinction between marijuana, alcohol, and harder drugs. Because Cole is so often trying to convince us, he frequently only tells one side of the story, concealing the full picture in order to win an argument that nobody started.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/j-cole-kod/,Dreamville,2018.0
26,Kali Uchis,Isolation,Pop/R&B,8.6,April 11 2018,Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,"Kali Uchis opens Isolation with a breezy Brazilian-jazz intro, psychedelic and motoring, as she coos birdlike about physical intimacy. Rio singer/goddess Flora Purim immediately springs to mind, and its ambitious vocal runs invoke cocktails and caftan weather, like Uchis recorded it by the beach. It’s an empathetic way to welcome a listener into an album, but more than that, it’s a statement piece: pointed evidence of the way she’s deepened her range en route to her debut album. “Just come closer, closer, closer,” she intones. Kali Uchis did not come to play. The 23-year-old Colombian-American singer has spent the last six years in the flourishing landscape of West Coast soul. She was often compared to Billie Holiday for her resonant alto and ability to imbue a dreamy love track with a wistful melancholy without giving up any of her power. That quality naturally invited comparisons to Amy Winehouse, too, but Uchis is slightly more plain-sad than self-destructive. Her ability to shimmy between genres has been exemplified by her omnivorous taste in collaborators—Snoop Dogg, who helped put her on in 2014, Colombian superstar Juanes, and Miguel, with whom she sang one of the best tracks on his 2017 album, War & Leisure. She has a baseline in R&B and often veers into the territory we used to call neo-soul. But Isolation projects how far out there she’s willing to go, exploring doo-wop, funk, bedroom pop, and reggaetón with equal enthusiasm and reverence while painting a fuller picture of herself as a dreamer, the femme fatale with around-the-way swagger who takes no shorts. The track most congruous with her past work—most specifically, her 2015 EP Por Vida—is the lo-fi surprise “In My Dreams,” which finds the Gorillaz calling upon the ghost of 2003 for its Casiotone-adjacent, ice-cream-twee production. She makes her voice uncharacteristically chirpy on the sardonically escapist lyrics: “Everything is just wonderful here in my dreams,” the subtext being that life is not so rosy. To emphasize that, Damon Albarn pops in to inject the affair with a slightly more pointed missive that “The moments we are happiest/Are the moments that we don’t exist.” It makes for a solid mission statement on an album where good news always comes with caveats. That notion is underlined in “Your Teeth on My Neck,” a deceptively perky indictment of industry vampires, labor exploitation, and general inequity, with a live-jazz backing by Los Angeles’ Wldrness. “What do you do it for, rich man keeps getting richer taking from the poor,” she sings, her voice a soaring scold. “You gotta get right.” Uchis has always been interested in speaking truth to power, and she mines her personal narrative—binational upbringing, immigrant parents, living out of her car—for a slyly political backdrop that feels neither too obvious nor preachy. That wisdom and storytelling acumen in her music feels strongest here on “Miami,” in which she and boricua rapper BIA narrate an immigrant perspective against a gossamer backdrop of the city that basically invented bisexual lighting. With languorous swing, Uchis parallels immigrant hustle with the rudely empty promise of the American dream, as in the line, “Why would I be Kim, I could be Kanye/In the land of opportunity and palm trees.” It’s a type of cinematic storytelling that feels almost vintage in this era of diaristic confessionals. Plus, it’s always nice to hear this kind of devotion to the concept of making a song about Miami that would sound great driving around Miami. “Miami” features production from TV on the Radio’s Dave Sitek, Frank Ocean collaborator Om’Mas Keith, Drake hitmaker DJ Dahi, and it’s a gleaming example of the veritable brain trust of musical talent assembled here, all serving the same purpose of showcasing Uchis’ fascinating confidence as a singer. Even as the album traverses genres, it’s united by a slinky desert vibe, a document of the way young Angelenos have opened up the way for sounds and genre to gloop in on each other like a lava lamp. In the early 2000s, this often manifested in navel-gazing and weeded beat experiments whose prime objective was headiness. But this generation—here, including Isolation guests like Tyler, the Creator, the Internet’s Steve Lacy, and BROCKHAMPTON’s Romil Hemnani—has found a way to make that style of experimentation inviting and friendly through an openness that is intellectual, but doesn’t depend on intellectualism as its prime objective. As a uniting force, Kali Uchis could not be stronger, nor as nimble with her ability to match lush beats with an even lusher voice. Isolation is a star turn from an artist who has proven she’s ready for it.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kali-uchis-isolation/,Virgin EMI,2018.0
27,Johnny Cash,American Recordings,Folk/Country,8.2,April 8 2018,Kaleb Horton,Contributor ,"When people ask where my grandpa is from, he doesn’t name a town. He says he was born “across the river from Johnny Cash.” There’s only one story my grandpa ever tells about his childhood. It’s 1955, in Arkansas, and he’s standing on his motorcycle, prying a bathroom window off the wall with a pocket knife and a screwdriver. He never got more than a fifth-grade education, but he’s breaking into a high school. He’s doing this because “I ain’t paying no two dollars for a concert.” The concert? Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. Elvis, he’s pretty good, my grandpa recalls. He’s alright except for the foolish hip movements. But Johnny, he’s got presence. He was there from day one, from the first day “Cry, Cry, Cry” got played on the radio. He bought every record. He knew every producer Johnny ever worked with, every sideman he ever played with, every man down and woman gone. He saw in Johnny not just the Southern man to emulate, but something close to a holy figure. Johnny Cash was the only infallible man on earth. Until 1994. The popular story goes like this: It’s 1994 and Johnny Cash’s career is all but dead. It’s a ghost haunting Billy Graham crusades and the dinner theaters of Branson, Missouri. He spent the 1980s a lost soul, recording bad music (“The Chicken in Black”) and watching the embers of his career fly away into the night. But then Rick Rubin, a bearded and inscrutable mystic, a man known for producing hard rock and hip-hop, brings him back to life in a house overlooking the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California with a brilliant idea that no one had ever thought of before—put Johnny Cash in a living room, hand him a guitar, set up a microphone, ask him to play the songs he loves, not for anybody else, just for him. Cash’s face lights up. He sings gutbucket songs about sin and redemption, and in the blink of an eye, Johnny Cash is himself again. He snaps out of his coma. He makes American Recordings, and all the critics love it. Hell, everybody loves it. He’s playing South by Southwest and Glastonbury and he’s on the road to becoming an eternal symbol of punk rock and anything that’s real, man, you know, authentic. Rubin is a miracle worker and he encourages Johnny Cash to make the best music of his life. This is the door Johnny Cash walks through to dethrone Hank Williams as the king of country music. But the true story of American Recordings is messier than that. It’s true that Johnny Cash had it rough in the ’80s. Columbia didn’t know what to do with a legacy act from 1955 and reluctantly dropped him, then the label he went with afterward, Mercury, treated him like he didn’t exist. Nobody was hearing his albums. One possible reason is that the country music business in the ’80s was making some historically terrible shit because of Urban Cowboy, a John Travolta vehicle easily summarized as Saturday Night Fever in cowboy boots. For the first half of the decade, the prevailing style bent toward the slick, the saccharine, the easy-listening. This was an environment that had little room for Johnny Cash, who came from the pill-guzzling highway to hell that Sun Records paved. But he had also been recording for decades, and his operating expenses were enormous. His distractibility was enormous. He was on and off pills, he had to play shows with the country supergroup the Highwaymen and he starred in a remake of the John Ford film Stagecoach and he was in his fifties and he had this thing going on with his jaw and, well, it happens. Despite all this, and in defiance of conventional wisdom, his material in the ’80s wasn’t all bad. “The Chicken in Black” is the sound of a brain breaking, but if you dig a little, you find that he also sang songs by some of country and folk’s best songwriters, from Billy Joe Shaver to John Prine and Guy Clark. In 1983, one year after it came out, he covered Springsteen’s “Highway Patrolman,” one of the toughest Springsteen songs to cover because of its ambiguous morality. It became one of the most artistically successful and satisfying covers of Cash’s entire career. More accurately, the problem with his ’80s work was the lack of a rudder. His shows weren’t great, he had gotten corny, and nobody in the business was really advocating for him. He needed somebody to say, “You’re great, and your best work is ahead of you.” A Rocky without a Mickey, he spent too much time looking at his rearview mirror. Luckily, new people were taking notice of Cash in the ’80s. New scenes, far away from Nashville. Nick Cave covered him on two albums in ’85 and ’86. In ’88, a British punk tribute to Cash called ’Til Things Are Brighter was released. It featured Pete Shelley of the Buzzcocks, Marc Almond of Soft Cell, and Jon Langford of the Mekons. It caught the critical eye of NME and Cash loved it. And in 1992, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, one of only a handful of country singers ever invited. And then in 1993, Bono asked him to record lead vocals for a song on the new U2 album. Fucking U2. Six-years-after-Joshua-Tree U2. And it wasn’t just any song, it was album closer “The Wanderer,” pure Johnny Cash fan fiction, a post-apocalyptic Christian epic that had only-Johnny-Cash-could-even-attempt-this lines like “I went out walking with a Bible and a gun.” A Johnny Cash comeback felt like a very real possibility. One problem. Branson. Poor Johnny got entangled in a deal to build a $35 million tourist trap in Branson called “Cash Country” and a theater with his name on it that would be his home base for live shows. The deal went bust, construction problems, new investors came in, and it became the Wayne Newton Theatre. Cash still had to play a bunch of dates there even though he was off the project. He had no choice. The money was too good. All this is in the back of his head when he plays the Rhythm Café in Santa Ana, California in February ’93, the last show before he heads back to Missouri. He can hear Branson, and it’s the sound of wolves. There’s only one relief, and it’s that Rick Rubin, Def Jam co-founder, producer of the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy, wants to meet him after the show to make an album. Cash is listening. He thinks Rubin wears clothes that “would have done a wino proud,” but he likes his individualism, and he knows that his own back is against the wall. So he goes to the hills above the Sunset Strip. He sits down in Rubin’s living room and plays songs that mean something to him, just him and his guitar, and Rubin rolls the tape. In three days, they’ve got north of 30 songs. Cowboy songs, folk songs, and old songs figure heavily. You know, songs about God, murder, trains, and everything else that makes America. Some of these songs are originals that Cash has been protecting from the black hole down which Mercury sent his music. These lock-and-key songs are the best. “Drive On” is a look at the inhumanity of Vietnam, about the soldiers who see their buddies die and have to walk on anyway. The strong vocal performance and catchy melody sound subversive in a way Cash hadn’t in a long time, as though they’re covering up brutality and PTSD. “Like a Soldier,” a song about a man trying to find salvation and forgiveness after a hard journey and a lot of mistakes, has beautiful lyrics Cash was wise to hide from Mercury. There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memory
Faces that I wish would not come back at all. Rubin’s excited by all this, but he’s still looking for the Johnny Cash who committed a murder in Nevada just to see the life drain from an innocent man’s eyes. When Cash plays an updated version of the murder ballad “Delia’s Gone,” he finds him. It’s based on an old folk song, he’d recorded it before, but there’s new life in it now. The protagonist is not terribly penitent, and he describes his crime in vivid detail, how much he hated Delia, how he tied her up and grabbed his “sub-mo-sheen.” It’s a murder ballad where the sinner finds pleasure in his sin. It’s Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, not Johnny Cash at a Billy Graham crusade. It’s a huge breakthrough, but Cash can’t stay because he has to do 40 dates at the Wayne Newton Theatre. Not even Edward Hopper could capture the alienation of Johnny Cash at seeing the buses of tourists and retirees showing up strictly for photo opportunities and trinkets, all while having to weather half-empty matinee shows and fight constant physical pain. This is the hell he’s trying to escape. So when he comes back to L.A. in the summer of ’93, naturally he slams out two dozen more songs in a few days, because no way in hell is he going back to Branson. He does Leonard Cohen’s “Bird on the Wire” and another Cash original, the salvation from the sin, “Redemption.” It’s a sanctified song about the power of the blood of Christ, and it grounds the album with an earnest devotion to God that every good Cash album needs. The story of sin cannot be told without the story of salvation. You’d think this was conceived as an acoustic album, but after Cash finishes recording, Rubin experiments with adding instrumentation from Mike Campbell of the Heartbreakers and Flea and Chad Smith of the Chili Peppers. It doesn’t really take, and he decides he prefers the iconic idea of Johnny Cash alone with his guitar. He sends Cash off to the Viper Room to play an insanely exclusive solo show for approximately zero people who deserve to be there, gets a couple live cuts to finish off the sucker, and names the finished album after his own record label, American Recordings. Cash preferred Late and Alone. Too bad. It doesn’t storm any charts after its release on April 26th, 1994, but Rolling Stone gives it five stars and raves about it. This is the mythic Johnny Cash, the tortured cowboy out on the prairie picking out “Oh Bury Me Not” in front of a campfire and seeing God on the horizon. Meanwhile, Nick Cave and U2 cohort Anton Corbijn makes a video for “Delia’s Gone” that gets actual MTV play. It stars Kate Moss and imagines Johnny Cash as Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter. You don’t need to see “LOVE” and “HATE” tattooed on his knuckles because you know it’s there. While all this makes him seem cool, it doesn’t translate to sales. The album peaks at a humble No. 23 on the Billboard country charts, though it does reintroduce Johnny Cash to rock audiences, to people who may conceivably own a Nirvana album. And it works, and leads to better, and better-selling, music later. Half the fun of American Recordings is knowing that it’s not the end of something, but the start of something. It sends him down a road that ends with him writing some of the best songs he’ll ever write and it nets him an immortality-cementing hit in 2002 with “Hurt.” Which, by the way, is unthinkable. To begin your career in 1955 and have a hit in 2002 is like starting out in 1971 and having a hit in 2018. Who the hell could even do that? Well, Johnny Cash, but not Johnny Cash without Rick Rubin. The album is good, but more importantly, it’s a shrewd marketing idea. The triumphant rebirth of the man in black, a tortured soul who sings about killing and being forgiven for killing. It’s showbizzy, of course. No man can be as “authentic” as Johnny Cash without a pretty firm grasp of how to work his audience. He had to stare at the grimy lights of the Sunset Strip to be the ancient voice of the dirt he’s known as now. A mythic American artist must be created and curated and rebranded, and Rick Rubin was in the right place at the right time to help Cash get there. And Cash knew he had a choice between giving this his best shot or withering in Branson. It’s hard to deny he chose wisely. In hindsight, the album is not the unqualified success it was made out to be in 1994. I firmly believe people wanted Johnny Cash to come back so bad that they willed this album into being what they wanted it to be. While “Delia’s Gone” captures the sinful giddiness of “Cocaine Blues,” while his original compositions are truly great Johnny Cash songs, and while the general mood of a frontier campfire is cool and transportive, there are weaknesses. There’s the Danzig song, “Thirteen,” the first of many gimmicky alt-rock collaborations Rubin would prod Cash into doing. The lyrics read like they were written in 20 minutes, which they were. And Cash has a booming, powerful voice but one thing he doesn’t have is a lot of vocal nuance. So when he tries out Loudon Wainwright III’s satiric “The Man Who Couldn’t Cry,” the smartassery those lyrics demand never shows up. And “Down There by the Train,” a beautiful Tom Waits composition written specifically for Cash, a Baptist epic of redemption where even John Wilkes Booth can feel God’s grace, doesn’t quite work either. Maybe because it’s too long. Maybe he could have sung it quieter. Maybe it needs an organ. The album’s real overarching problem is having Johnny Cash play guitar by himself with no accompaniment. While the man did innovative things with the guitar (the paper trick is cool, come on) and kept good rhythm, the fact is that he couldn’t play. This is an acoustic guitar album with almost no acoustic guitar on it. It sounds a cappella in places if you’re not paying close enough attention. His vocal power has to carry him wherever he goes, and there are some songs where that’s just not possible. It’s a problem Cash and Rubin eventually solved by recruiting the Heartbreakers to play on pretty much every subsequent song Cash recorded, to lend momentum, dramatic shading, and emphasis to prop up Cash’s delivery. This album has no such fix, so it occasionally drags when you divorce it from its story, that Johnny Cash is back. It’s good, but now that Cash is gone, it’s no starting place to understand his work. If you want to understand his appeal, there’s still only one definitive starting place, and that’s the prison albums, where country, gospel and rockabilly get soaked in ethanol. My grandpa never bought a Johnny Cash album after American Recordings. He didn’t like this album because it was the first time he ever heard Johnny Cash sound weak, and he didn’t want to hear that. It was a Johnny Cash my grandpa didn’t want to know existed, a Johnny Cash who could die soon. It sounded to him like a man revealing himself too much, being too vulnerable. That generational divide is important. I have problems with every Johnny Cash album Rick Rubin produced, though I like all of them. Rick Rubin is a savvy marketer and a sporadically excellent producer but his cover suggestions were never as smart as he thought they were, and I don’t think the world needed to hear Johnny Cash cover Depeche Mode. But that mistake is probably the reason we have “Hurt” and “The Man Comes Around,” Cash’s definitive song about God, so on balance I look the other way. American Recordings is flawed, and it’s not a masterpiece. Nearly a quarter-century on, it’s just a good Johnny Cash album. But it brought him back to the ground, and that was necessary. He was no longer Johnny Cash, towering celebrity. He was Johnny Cash, human being. His vulnerability, his fallibility, was relatable. He didn’t sound perfect, but he sounded like himself again. And he was comfortable being himself again. There are two dogs on the album cover. He named them Sin and Redemption.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/johnny-cash-american-recordings/,American Recordings,1994.0
28,Kacey Musgraves,Golden Hour,Folk/Country,8.7,April 2 2018,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"Kacey Musgraves’ third album goes down so smoothly that it might not even scan as a total reinvention. Throughout the songs on Golden Hour, the East Texas singer-songwriter is radiant, awestruck, taking the scenic route to the bar just for the hell of it. After Musgraves’ previous two albums, which felt like they were cut from the same home-sewn flannel cloth, she now ventures beyond the front-porch hum of country music. The new Kacey Musgraves needs strings, vocoders, disco beats. And if this sounds like a left turn for the lovable cynic who once characterized the world as an absurd beauty contest, a vicious cycle, a bad party, and a toxic boys’ club, well, that’s kinda the point. Since her last proper album, 2015’s Pageant Material, the now 29-year-old singer-songwriter has changed her perspective. There was a spirited Christmas record, a creatively charged acid trip, and a rustic country wedding. It’s like Musgraves’ life was given the season-finale treatment: a series of climactic turns that left her standing misty-eyed on a cliffside, bellowing “I get it!” at the sunrise. She’s updated her music accordingly. On Golden Hour, everything sprawls and swells and gushes, a gaping sky that makes the sonic landscapes of her previous albums feel like mere set dressing. For these songs of hope and wonder, she nods to meticulous folk epics like Beck’s Sea Change, or Sufjan Stevens’ Seven Swans if it was re-cut for an IMAX screen. She’s settled on enlightenment as a new resting state. The result is Musgraves’ most accessible record and her most ambitious, a magnetic, comfortable culmination of her pop and country instincts. While dynamic enough to house both the stirring, alone-at-the-piano fragment “Mother” and a full-on country-disco kiss-off in “High Horse,” Golden Hour is alluringly cohesive, both lyrically and musically. In “Wonder Woman,” she confronts a partner’s unrealistic expectations and gives a simple counter: “All I need’s a place to land.” Throughout these songs, she finds one. Despite the grandeur of its music, Golden Hour offers Musgraves’ most understated songwriting, a refreshing evolution as stars like Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga accidentally turn Americana-pop into grim satire. In the stunning single “Space Cowboy,” she weaves in at least a dozen genre tropes without drawing any attention to them. Instead, you’re left dazzled by the way her bold, drawling voice can cut through simple ideas—“Sunsets fade/And love does too”—like she’s the first person to notice, and you’re the first one she’s telling. Sometimes, that familiarity belies the complexity of these songs. Tracks like “Love Is a Wild Thing” and “Oh, What a World” swirl around the positive messages in their titles in a state of euphoria. Musgraves includes precious few of the subtle details that made her 2013 breakthrough, Same Trailer Different Park, feel so instantly familiar. On a previous record, she might have provided a tour of the neighborhood that landlocks the star-crossed home-bodies in “Lonely Weekend,” or cracked a stoner joke about the “plants that grow and open your mind” in “Oh, What a World.” In the places where you’d expect Musgraves to land her punches, she sometimes offers just a wistful sigh. But if the tension in her earlier work came from her sharp observations and underdog spirit, there’s something more complicated at play here. “Is there a word for the way that I’m feeling tonight,” she asks in “Happy & Sad,” attempting to pinpoint the creeping melancholy undercutting an otherwise blissful evening. Golden Hour is an album-length ode to not having the right words, to being overcome by the moment and surrendering to it. Musgraves’ songwriting melts seamlessly between celebration—in heart-eyed-emoji anthems like “Butterflies” and “Velvet Elvis”—and elegies for when those feelings start to dim. The cinematic arrangements rarely distinguish between those two modes, coating the album in a pristine, sepia glow that makes tales of solitude like “Lonely Weekend” seem downright inviting. There’s a subtle awareness throughout these songs of what happens as soon as the golden hour ends, how quickly that burst of light can fade without a trace. In the title track, Musgraves compares her contentment to a temporary trick of the light: “All that I know,” she admits, “Is you caught me at the right time.” Less concerned with outside forces than internal balance, Golden Hour stands as an assured, artful snapshot of a particular rush of feelings, but its wisdom speaks volumes to Musgraves’ ongoing evolution. “If you’re ever gonna find a silver lining,” she sang in the first track on her major label debut, “It’s gotta be a cloudy day.” Even then, she suspected that ecstasy is most rewarding when it’s hard-won. On Golden Hour, she wears the sunlight well.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kacey-musgraves-golden-hour/,MCA Nashville ,2018.0
29,Miles Davis,Get Up With It,Jazz,9.6,March 11 2018,Andy Beta,Contributor,"One autumn in New York, in 1972, the most famous jazz musician in the world tried to take a right turn at 60 mph off the West Side Highway and totaled his Lamborghini Miura. A bystander found Miles Davis with both legs broken, covered in blood and cocaine. Even after the crash, Miles had a bleeding ulcer, a bad hip, nodes in his larynx, and a heart attack while on tour in Brazil. He spat blood onstage, his legs in so much pain he had to work his wah-wah and volume pedals with his hands, and offstage, he self-medicated with Scotch and milk, Bloody Marys, Percodan, and more cocaine. “Everything started to blur after that car accident,” Miles later wrote. His trajectory up to that point was a blur of a different hue. From teen sideman to Charlie Parker’s bebop revolution to a solo career that’s better compared to Pablo Picasso than other jazz musicians, Miles instigated entire paradigm shifts in music. Or, as he hissed to a matron at a White House dinner in the 1980s: “I’ve changed music five or six times.” Most narratives point to iconic albums like Birth of the Cool, Relaxin’ With the Miles Davis Quintet, Kind of Blue, Sketches of Spain, Miles Smiles and Bitches Brew, but his 1974 album Get Up With It hangs like an ominous storm cloud over them all, the one that fans of his other works might hesitate to name, his last studio album before he fell mute for the rest of the decade. Like Orpheus grieving in the underworld or Marlow going up the river, Miles went to a place that forever altered his DNA. When he finally returned to the studio, he never sounded the same. Starting with Bitches Brew in 1970, Miles proceeded to drop eight double albums as well as audacious efforts like A Tribute to Jack Johnson and On the Corner, each one deploying a strategy that undercut his audiences’ expectations. With Get Up With It, Miles began the most defiant shift of his storied career, dropping a totemic yet untidy leviathan that rebuffed jazz fans and critics alike. Each song careens between extremes, as Miles presages everything still to come: ambient, no wave, world beat, jungle, new jack swing, post-rock, even hinting at the future sound of R&B and chart-topping pop. For many modern fans, it’s his heaviest era, but Miles himself offers little insight into his mindset of that period, the music barely mentioned in his 1989 book Miles: The Autobiography. Instead, he writes: “I was spiritually tired of all the bullshit…I felt artistically drained, tired… And the more I stayed away, the deeper I sank into another dark world.” The sessions that comprise Get Up span four years and include a roster that reflects Miles and the transitory nature of his ever-molting priorities: Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Billy Cobham, Al Foster, Airto, John McLaughlin, Reggie Lucas, Pete Cosey, James Mtume, David Liebman, and many more appear. Behind them sat producer and editor Teo Macero, who shepherded hours of sessions and chaos into something majestic. The stabilizing force, however, was teen bassist Michael Henderson, lifted from Stevie Wonder’s band and dropped in to anchor each iteration of Miles’ groups for the next seven years. Deemed too simplistic a player by the jazz cognoscenti, Henderson’s funk vamps function like simple machines, wedging between the beats to pry open more space, each cycling riff tightening like a screw. By this point in the ’70s, Miles was moving away from jazz fusion’s popularity to something more primal and sanguinary. His band grew more Afrocentric, and thanks in no small part to his wife of one year Betty Davis (née Mabry), Miles started listening to Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, and Sly and the Family Stone. But he also had an ear tuned to Aretha Franklin, Ann Peebles and—in one of his inimitable turns of phrase—told DownBeat magazine, “If Al Green had one tit, I’d marry that motherfucker.” Still, beneath all that, another sound was stirring, one that hearkened back to his East St. Louis childhood. Early in his autobiography, Miles talks about “That roadhouse music, or what some call honky-tonk…that shit that they play in black ’bucket of blood’ clubs…the fights that were likely to jump off in those clubs.” Moving towards the downbeat of funk also meant moving to that ur-throb pulsing beneath it like a pulmonary vein. “I was trying to play the music I grew up on now, that roadhouse, honky-tonk, funky thing that people used to dance to on Friday and Saturday nights,” he wrote of his impetus for much of the ’70s. “It has to get down inside your body, up into your blood before you can do it correctly.” So Miles got Hancock, Jarrett, and McLaughlin to submit to the jerky strut of “Honky Tonk” and hopped on “Red China Blues,” a bit of Sonny Williamson-meets big band boilerplate that serve as the album’s obvious outliers. During these sessions, Miles began to seek an emphasis on rhythm above all else. “Miles left post-bop modernism for the funk because he was bored fiddling with quantum mechanics and just wanted to play the blues again,” Greg Tate posited in his essay “The Electric Miles.” For the remainder of the ’70s, Miles was one of reduction as well as negation. For all of its two-hour runtime, Get Up barely features his trumpet, a trend already reflected in his live shows of the time. After decades of the finest pianists in jazz serving as his sidemen, Miles himself moved to the electric organ. Miles’ organ playing didn’t have the nuance, shade, and heights of his trumpet, but with the electric organ, vast new chasms opened up to him: seismic drones, durative noise blasts, a sense of deep space and foreboding void that the trumpet otherwise punctures. Dark arts arose from his keys, as Sly Stone’s bassist of the time recalled during one coke-fueled night: “[Miles] got on Sly’s organ and started to voice these nine-note, ethereal crazy chords. Sly…came out yelling, ’Who in the fuck is doing that on my organ? Miles, get your motherfucking ass out…Don’t ever play that voodoo shit here.’” Rather than run the voodoo down, now Miles could conjure it all by himself. How else to get that vertiginous, heart-strangling fear and magnificent malefic-ness of “Rated X”? Full of dread and a speedball of drums, conga, and tabla, it’s a track that plays with the ideas of no wave, post-punk, and techno at its most brusque. But Macero’s editing style (dropping out the rhythm section entirely and letting the keys levitate in mid-air) also anticipates the modern horror movie aesthetic, the flickering cuts akin to the terror of an approaching tornado, bloody machete, or unmoored jet turbine. For the better part of “Maiysha,” Davis’ keys act as breezy as any other jazz organ trio (think Groove Holmes or Big John Patton), though ten minutes in, lead guitarist Pete Cosey enters and the two hit a tone kin to electrocuting a tomcat. In Cosey, Miles found a sparring partner unlike any other. There had been the likes of Parker, Coltrane, Shorter, even McLaughlin in the past, but only Cosey could range wider and push Miles deeper, from country blues to Muddy Waters, microtonal tunings to Hendrix at his most atonal. Cosey was an imposing force with his thick shades, towering afro, and an array of pedals and synthesizers that melted futuristic noise and old ghosts together that made him demiurge to metalheads, noiseniks and punks alike. Hearing Cosey and Miles trade solos on the furious “Mtume” is like relishing the bloody spray of each landed blow in a heavyweight fight. Miles veered in tone from lines chopped like a coke rail to higher than a chemtrail. To Cosey, the music warranted such extremes. “That music was about life,” he said in one interview. “It dealt with cleansing. It dealt with rising and falling. It was extremely cerebral, but it was earthy at the same time.” Get Up With It’s crushing emotional gravity comes from two 32-minute pieces that are unlike anything else in Miles’ catalog, much less the history of jazz, ranging from despair to rage, pride to anguish, ecstasy to abject sadness. There’s the frenzy of “Calypso Frelimo,” which takes its name from the Mozambique political party seeking independence from Portuguese colonial rule. It sounds like a riot in the middle of a block party. Miles layers his wah-wah horn and electric organ into an ebullient Caribbean theme as Henderson holds down the low-end with Mtume and drummer Al Foster. Densely polyrhythmic yet melodically slick, with incandescent solos from Miles, Cosey and tenor saxophonist Dave Liebman race through the din. They never break away from the matrices that band lays down, they illuminate every hectic angle of it. For a certain generation, the triplet bass figure that Henderson drops ten minutes in feels instantly familiar. It brings up images of your childhood living room as well as a subterranean realm, so closely does it resemble Koji Kondo’s theme for the underworld levels of “Super Mario Bros.” Tate calls the work a “dub fugue,” centering on that cavernous bass throb and a telling juxtaposition of Caribbean elements and European ones that reflects back on the title itself. The massive piece suggests a Pangaea that connects the Caribbean rhythms of reggae and calypso to African-American jazz and back to Africa herself. And then there’s the elegy of “He Loved Him Madly.” Recorded a month after the passing of Duke Ellington, its title taken from a Christmas card greeting Duke sent to Miles the year before. It both summons the ghost of Duke’s “jungle style” big bands and anticipates the forsaken pall of dark ambient. Assembled from five separate takes, Macero wove the seemingly aimless recordings into a magnum opus, one that Brian Eno later hailed as “revolutionary,” finding in its half-hour descent “the ‘spacious’ quality I was after” for his own future ambient work. It’s a eulogy to Duke that seems to emanate from across the River Styx. Mtume’s congas flutter like bats across the stereo field, Cosey spins out cobwebs on guitar, with Macero’s spacing suggestive of a gaping void in the center of the piece. Miles looms around C-minor on organ, and when his muted trumpet finally sounds at the midway point, he channels longtime Ellington trumpeter Cootie Williams, seeming both close as a whisper and a distant wail. Erotic and ethereal at once, a second solo comes as the band starts to quicken, only to have it all turn phantasmagoric by song’s end. Less than a year after Get Up With It’s release, Miles plunged deeper into “another dark world,” one where no sound escaped for the next seven years. Lurid stories abound about his reclusive, sordid, filthy lifestyle holed up in his Upper West Side brownstone during those years, as well as numerous run-ins with the law and fears of his imminent demise in the press. He had burned a bridge, one that had led him to the brink of madness. “You can’t know how terrifying it is to be in the middle of all of that, it’s endless sound,” he confessed to one interviewer at the time. “Music is a curse.” During that same span, his Get Up With It bandmates also stepped away from that endless sound, instead infiltrating the realms of R&B and pop, scoring frothy hits ranging from “You Are My Starship” to “Never Knew Love Like This Before.” Guitarist Reggie Lucas worked with a new singer named Madonna, writing “Borderline” and producing her debut album. And together with percussionist Mtume, they formed the funk band Mtume, responsible for that ode to gumilingus, “Juicy Fruit.” The demented, paranoid, self-imposed exile of Miles Davis was a tragedy, a genius turned into a man as shell-shocked as any Vietnam War veteran. When he returned to the studio in 1981 with the turgid and slick The Man With the Horn and his subsequent ’80s work, Miles sounded like a doppelgänger of his former self. He and his band had willingly gone to the darkest places of the soul during Get Up With It and—as he notoriously did to his audiences at his peak—now he willingly turned his back on it. Dipping into elevator music takes on “Time After Time” and “Human Nature,” Miles also continued to play the blues, but a more bloodless version of them. Much like Sly Stone before him, Miles ventured into the heart of darkness with Get Up With It and wrestled with the devil for his gun. But in coming out on the other side of this music, Miles and his band were irrevocably transformed. Or as he would realize near the end of his life: “You don’t change music, music changes you.”",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/miles-davis-get-up-with-it/,Columbia,1974.0
30,Nipsey Hussle,Victory Lap,Rap,7.8,February 24 2018,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"It’s taken Los Angeles MC Nipsey Hussle longer than most to create his moment. The seasoned mixtape veteran has been on the indie-rap circuit for almost a decade and was once touted as a future star. When fame didn’t come, he made his own seat at the table, infamously selling copies of his Crenshaw tape for $100 each and getting JAY-Z to endorse him and buy 100 of them. He parlayed his rap successes into local business ventures—including a hair shop and a “smart store” for his clothing line—and became a hometown hero who turned his talent into a small merchandising empire. Victory Lap, his first album on a multi-project deal with Atlantic Records, is more than six years in the making. It is formally his “debut album” but functionally his big cash in. Bridging several generations of West Coast rap, Victory Lap uses his cache of war stories to power the most gripping entry in his catalog, recouping an investment. His raps are still riddled with flashbacks to gangland survivalism, but he’s focused on his pivot to legitimacy, how he flipped Cripping on Crenshaw into a lucrative indie-rap career and then flipped that into an entrepreneurial enterprise. Black capitalism is foremost on his mind these days; he wants to build up his community and get others to follow, advocating for the grooming of more strong black men. But Nipsey’s ambitions can be more problematic than they seem on the surface: He has used his enthusiasm can to fuel homophobia, denigrating many of the men he claims to want to empower. There are nuggets to take aways from his lectures, but the primary lesson to be learned here is just how ingrained “toughness” is in representations of manhood. As statements go, Victory Lap is more of a remembrance than a celebration. From digging up $100,000 his brother buried in his mother’s backyard for safekeeping only to discover half the money had molded to fighting off surprise challengers trying to steal jewelry from his entourage in Vegas, the album painstakingly documents the life of a reformed bruiser turned hood economist. Self-taught and self-funded, Nipsey fought to escape the cycle of an existence measured only in summers—time spent as “the man” on the block or serving sentences in the pen. He has been chasing sustainability since he was a teenager, and now that he has it, he’s appreciative, relieved even. He doesn’t just bask in his moment, though, he challenges others to pursue the same goals, as on “Million While You Young,” which equates money with salvation (“I can tell you niggas how I came up/Similar to climbin’ out the grave, huh”). His flow is effortless, letting off stream-of-consciousness musings on death and loss that carry anxiety and paranoia within: “All my partners steady passin’, tryna wiggle through this madness/Tryna fight this gravity at times and I swear I could feel it pull me backwards/Puttin’ thousands on they caskets, tryna pick the right reactions/I appreciate the process, but I’m so conflicted about the status,” he raps on “Status Symbol 3.” Ghosts of lost friends and loved ones haunt his raps, the echoes of shots fired long ago still ring in his ears, and his verses are full of close calls.  There are subtle tensions within even his most gaudy tales, as no win has come without consequence or sacrifice. But his raps aren’t just a mark of persistence, they are a push to improve—both his state of mind and quality of life. Nipsey’s rhymes are designed to string out little observations until they form a big idea. They aren’t instantly quotable, but they slowly unspool to reveal kernels of fortune-cookie wisdom. “This ain’t entertainment, it’s for niggas on the slave ship/These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with,” he raps on “Dedication.” The remarks don’t always connect or make sense in sequence but they can create powerful impressions. He stays on-message almost the entire record, promoting the expansion of black wealth. On “Last Time That I Checc’d,” which is in part an homage to Jeezy, he salutes hustlers in the streets trying to feed their kids and single moms struggling to make ends meet. But he calls for more “black owners” and presents himself as the template. Debuts are usually albums of firsts, but Victory Lap is full of sequels and standards. When it isn’t heavily indebted to his West Coast forebears Snoop Dogg, Ice-T, and Dj Quik, or literally adding a follow-up in a song series—“Blue Laces 2,” “Keyz 2 the City 2”—it is returning to Nipsey’s well for hard-nosed bully rap. The hour-long album honors all the work he’s put in and looks back at all he’s achieved, but it also looks forward to all he has yet to build and all those he can still inspire. His tactics can be tone-deaf and without nuance, but he knows exactly who he’s speaking to and for.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nipsey-hussle-victory-lap/,"All Money In,Atlantic",2018.0
31,OutKast,Stankonia,Rap,9.5,February 11 2018,kris ex,Contributor,"They always had chips on their shoulders, a grievance born of their distinctive authorship mixed with the civic pride of scrappy underdogs. They were André “3000” Benjamin and Antwan “Big Boi” Patton, but they went by an increasing array of colorful names—like Possum Aloysius Jenkins and Daddy Fat Sax—which seemed to exist only to expand minds and expectations while capturing the ideas that emanated from their craniums. They had emerged from southwest Atlanta with styles that were unforeseen, but quickly copied—the Kangol hats they wore in the video for “Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik” were soon seen atop the domes of Sean “Diddy” Combs and the Notorious B.I.G. after having been out of vogue for years. On the intro to Stankonia—their fourth album, a thrill-pushing auricular splattering of mindfunks and ideascapes—they mimicked those copying them by playfully reinterpreting the Atlanta “bounce” that had been spreading as the distraction of babies. Big Boi exhaled smoke and lamented, “Niggas ain’t even from the A-Town.” Identity and location—and defining and observing the two on their own terms—have always been key with OutKast. All of their albums began with a disembodied intro track as a prelude, followed by a State of the OutKast declaration that proved that, as André would famously go on to say at the 1995 Source Awards, “the South got something to say.” Tellingly, André confessed, “I gots a lot of shit up on my mind,” on “Myintrotoletuknow” from their 1994 debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. Their voices spat out harsh rhymes and stretched out melodic moments, but they also spoke about things widely and deeply, respecting and commenting on everything going on hip-hop, largely by ignoring everything going on in hip-hop. Their sonic brashness and directness had Public Enemy’s Chuck D in its DNA, their fashion had antecedents in the Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five meeting Afrika Bambaataa’s Soul Sonic Force, the subversive whimsy of De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest were their forebears, giving the group a musical intensity and breadth incomparable to any other major hip-hop act before or since. Those are weighty statements, but OutKast was OutKast—singular, inimitable, and unpredictable. Their debut was an album bursting with the funk descended from the Isley Brothers, Isaac Hayes, and Curtis Mayfield in a way that was smoother than Dr. Dre’s G-funk stylings, more organic than Puff Daddy’s wholesale sampling of ’80s R&B, and more fluid and adventurous than hometown icon Jermaine Dupri’s sleek soul and pop arrangements. It was the music of Southern hip-hop, the “country rap tunes” pioneered by the late Pimp C, outfitted to a weary worldview that was cautious and specific about local dealings and paranoid about the greater world, but ultimately hopeful on universal levels—or, at least as hopeful as “Crumblin’ Erb” while “niggas killin’ niggas” can be. Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was a revelation to hip-hop: Two dope boys in a Cadillac rapping just as well as, if not better than, just about anyone around them, sharing untold tales of Atlanta slums and Georgia red clay and opining on race in a way that introduced the concept of the Dirty South a year before they’d give it a name with the Goodie Mob. OutKast’s arrival was as eye-opening as N.W.A.’s had been in the late ’80s and their next project, ATLiens (1996) quickly vaporized any notions of sophomore slumps song-by-song, rhyme-by-rhyme. With their third album, Aquemini (1998)—a total fuck-you to any ideas of limitations on what a street-rooted hip-hop album could sound like, think like, and talk about—they ascended to rare air: musical acts who have been able to pull off a hat-trick of commercial and critical hits with their first three releases. In this way, 2000’s Stankonia was set up to be a victory lap—the group really had nothing left to prove. Each album had further refined their mastery; each one was a tour de force in its own right. But where Aquemini seemed to be rejecting most radio leanings with sprawling jam-session numbers like “SpottieOttieDopaliscious,” “Liberation,” “Synthesizer,” and “Chonkyfire,” Stankonia found OutKast catering to a mass market without seeming to give it much thought. The album’s two most indelible hits—“So Fresh, So Clean” and “Ms. Jackson”—are unrepentant earworms that feel like natural extensions of the group’s sound, not crossover attempts. Both songs are full of layered and complex intonations: “So Fresh” simply speaks on haberdashery and hoes, while “Jackson” went on to win a Grammy, despite being a somewhat heady and sincere dedication to their baby mama’s mamas. Produced by their longtime collaborators and mentors Organized Noize, “Jackson” is one of the best radio singles they’ve ever produced as a duo. It has to be mentioned that the group, along with their longtime DJ, Mr. DJ, had begun handling the bulk of their production with Aquemini and it sounded as if their longtime producers, Organized Noize—who had stunned on Goodie Mob’s debut, created one of TLC’s defining songs with “Waterfalls” and produced En Vogue’s biggest hit, “Don’t Let Go (Love)”—had actually been holding the duo back musically. Stankonia was an orgy of sonics leftover from Lee Perry’s Black Ark and George Clinton’s Mothership that sounded like drugs without sounding druggy. It was the acoustics of outer space talking about inner spaces; a self-driving Tesla in the body of a Cadillac Fleetwood; it was Wakanda. It’s no coincidence that former OutKast satellite Killer Mike’s group with rapper-producer El-P, Run the Jewels introduced the fictional nation in the first trailer for Marvel’s Black Panther—OutKast was at once retro and futuristic, veteranized and new school, otherworldly yet street, out of time and timeless, and their impact is evident in the biggest rap acts of today, from Migos to Kendrick Lamar. There is so much going across Stankonia—the coordinated confetti of noises on “Gangsta Shit,” the uneasy meditation of teen pregnancy that is “Toilet Tisha,” the playful lasciviousness of “I’ll Call Before I Come,” the melodic menace of “Red Velvet,” the skits that spoke in metaphors to the subconscious via hood tongues, the arrangements and progressions that felt capricious, but totally natural. The backing tracks weren’t soundscapes as much as they are aural murals graffitied on the cosmic underpasses where abandoned tricked-out space shuttles rest, stripped of their Brougham rims. It was music that was tangential to crunk, a predecessor to trap, indebted to hip-hop, electro, funk, rock, and anything alternative—the type of music that usually succeeds on intellectual levels and rewards nerds, but not readily equating to an album that would sell more than 4 million copies. Yet OutKast is probably best defined by defying parameters and expectations. Stankonia is easily the group’s most expansive and abrasive effort. It’s more accomplished than their biggest seller, the double-disc Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which lacks the tension and dichotomy of André and Big Boi locked in a studio, warring with each other and themselves to the extent that created numbers like “Humble Mumble,” Stankonia’s breakbeat-ish, Caribbean-tinged track where Big Boi admonishes a simp with “Sloppy slippin’ in your pimpin’, nigga/You either pistol whip the nigga or you choke the trigger,” before André recalls speaking with a rap critic: “She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol/I said ‘Oh, hell naw!’/But, yet, it's that too.” OutKast had always consisted of a politically conscious pimp and a spiritual gangsta, but on Stankonia, those identities came to the fore with a greater distinction that paradoxically allowed them to sound closer together than they had since their inception—even as André sat out songs like “Snappin’ & Trappin’” and “We Luv Deez Hoez.” On Stankonia’s first proper song, “Gasoline Dreams” Big Boi raps about their clout and the limits thereof—“Officer, get off us, sir/Don’t make me call [my label boss] L.A. [Reid], he’ll having you walking, sir/A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to city/But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity”—while André throttles out a brainy hook: “Don’t everybody like the smell of gasoline?/Well burn, motherfucker, burn American dreams.” Stankonia is an album about many things and full of epigrams; so ahead of the curve that one of its many double entendres—“I got a stick and want your automatic”—is now a bona fide triple entendre. It’s about sounds as smells and music as sex, but mostly it’s about two black kids from Southwest Atlanta, boogieing with chips on their shoulders, making Molotov cocktails of songs that sound like a revolution’s afterparty. It’s peppered with personal narratives and small slips of autobiography, and it tackles big ideas both directly and obliquely. But, ultimately, it sounds like two artists going pop on their own terms while trying to make sense of, and change, the world around them. Closing in on two decades after its release, Stankonia remains loud as bombs over Baghdad and humble as a mumble in the jungle.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/outkast-stankonia/,"La Face,Arista",2000.0
32,Khruangbin,Con Todo El Mundo,Rock,7.6,February 1 2018,Erin MacLeod,Contributor,"Khruangbin craft atmosphere music that never fades into the background, like some endless curl of smoke that keeps pluming upward. Sprinkled with snippets of spoken word, faint vocal melodies, and ranging and impeccably performed guitar solos, the whole of their second record, Con Todo El Mundo is, in effect, a long and pleasant head nod that seems to hang between continents and eras. The group—whose name is a transliteration of the Thai word for “airplane”—elicits the same eclectic enjoyment of any number of artists that came of age around the turn of the century, from the laid-back trip-hop feel of Kruder & Dorfmeister to dub-jammy Thievery Corporation: Ethereal instrumental music that might be described as “world” as shorthand for its range of melody, rhythm, and overall vibe. But the Houston-based instrumental trio makes music that’s a little more dusty, frayed around the edges, and personal. Though clearly informed by psychedelic rock, the primary influence that fueled their 2015 debut, The Universe Smiles Upon You, was Thai funk, music that bassist Laura Lee and guitarist Mark Speer found by scouring the Thai music blog, Monrakplengthai. Speer was in a gospel band with hip-hop producer and drummer Donald “DJ” Johnson, who became the third member, adding the more influences to the blend, and plenty of breakbeats. But Con Todo El Mundo broadens the group’s sound, maintaining the funk but also adding bits and pieces of Caribbean, Indian, and Middle Eastern music. Iran is the obvious touchstone in “Maria También,” whose video directly addresses women’s rights in that country. Throw in a few retro surf riffs and whispered vocal lines and you’ve got an aesthetic that feels at home at any beach or desert in the world. From the laidback first few seconds of guitar, bass, and organ that begins “Cómo Me Quieres” (“How do you love me?” )—the question answered by the album’s title Con Todo El Mundo (“With all the world”)—it’s clear that this music might be the perfect accompaniment to just about any somewhat passive activity. Cooking? Studying? Walking? Riding the bus? Khruangbin have your back. Need to speed it up a little? Skip to the funky, zouk-styled bounce of “Evan Finds the Third Room.” Relaxing around the house on a Sunday afternoon? Try the loping slowness of “A Hymn.” Every track is profoundly pleasant and, at times, even danceable, in a crunchy kind of way. Perhaps this is music for the Spotify era; a flowchart of sounds spawned from a range of music connected by the wonders of algorithmic technology. Describing how musical influence can be found anywhere, drummer Johnson describes Shazaming tunes in his local pho restaurant, and the band also offers a curated Spotify playlists for listeners. Each one contains music that influenced the band while recording and allows the playlist to be tailored to the length of an airplane journey and tweaked according to the mood. It may read like a slight to say that Con Todo El Mundo sounds like the result of an algorithm, but it’s an algorithm that reflects the way music is now consumed. Every week listeners “discover” new rhythms catered to an activity or previous selections. But it also allows, maybe, just maybe, for what was once called “world music” to slide into these shuffled, technologically selected playlists. Khruangbin’s takes this new mode of listening and injects its own singular and developing personality into the playlisting of modern music.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/khruangbin-con-todo-el-mundo/,"Night Time Stories Ltd.,Dead Oceans",2018.0
33,2Pac,All Eyez on Me,Rap,9.4,January 28 2018,Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,"About 300 miles north of Manhattan sits the Clinton Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison that, in 1995, housed its most famous inmate: Tupac Amaru Shakur. He had been sentenced to one and a half to four and a half years in a sexual assault trial the previous fall. On top of normal psychological torture that comes with imprisonment, Pac was also having trouble sleeping. In November of the previous year—the night before a jury convicted him—he was shot in the lobby of a Manhattan recording studio. “I have headaches,” he’d later tell Vibe. “I wake up screaming. I’ve been having nightmares, thinking they’re still shooting me.” But outside of prison, he was becoming a superstar. In March of ’95, Interscope released Pac’s third album, Me Against the World. It’s a remarkable record, at turns tender and fatalistic. There are fever dreams of the golden age in New York City; he mulls suicide and perches by windows with AKs. The album went immediately to No. 1. It also had Pac’s first Top 10 hit, the towering “Dear Mama,” where he raps about “hugging on my mama from a jail cell.” Few mothers could relate more than Afeni Shakur, who was one of 21 members of the Black Panther Party indicted by a New York grand jury in 1971. They were accused of plotting to bomb two police precincts and the Queens Board of Education office, and of planning to shoot the officers who would flee from one of the precincts after the explosion. The Panthers were ultimately acquitted on all 156 counts in what was, at the time, the most expensive trial in the history of New York state. A month later, Afeni gave birth to her son who, growing up in East Harlem, was surrounded by radicals: the Panthers, the Black Liberation Army; Assata Shakur was a family friend. His stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, was on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list and on the run for much of the ’80s—FBI agents would approach Tupac at school and hound him for information. “Dear Mama” and the rest of Me Against the World was written and recorded at a tipping point. “I Get Around” and “Keep Ya Head Up” were gold records, and roles in the films Juice and Poetic Justice revealed a complex, magnetic actor. But legal bills were stacking up. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail for his part in a fight at a Michigan State concert; he served 15 days for assaulting the director Allen Hughes, who had fired him from the set of Menace II Society. Then, of course, there was the sexual assault case that ultimately landed him in Clinton. While he planned to appeal the case, he couldn’t scrape together the $1.4 million he needed to bail himself out. Royalties weren’t rolling in fast enough, and the Panthers were nowhere to be found. So there he sat with his headaches and nightmares. Enter Suge Knight, the imposing co-founder of Death Row Records. By 1995, Death Row was a behemoth, and Suge had muscled his way into boardrooms, helped make Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg superstars, and taunted Puff in Midtown at the Source Awards in what’s arguably become the most-quoted podium speech in rap’s history. His grip on the West Coast might have been tenuous—Snoop was in constant legal peril, and Suge was likely beginning to sense that Dre wanted off of the label—but it was, for the moment, unquestioned. Burned onto the retinas of anyone in the business was Suge draped in blood red, chomping on an unlit cigar, scowling, dangling pop stars off hotel balconies by their ankles. The exact business arrangement Suge negotiated for Pac’s bail is hazy: In The Defiant Ones, the HBO documentary that aired last year, those who worked at each major label say that Atlantic and Interscope financed and engineered Pac’s move from Interscope to Death Row as a way to placate Time Warner’s skittishness about gangsta rap. Either way, the bail got paid, and Pac was locked into a three-album contract with Death Row. It was a relationship that would irreparably alter Pac’s life, Suge’s life, and the arc of rap history. It would also yield All Eyez on Me, one of the most sprawling, furious, paranoid, brilliant albums ever released. The anger that simmered in Tupac through his time in Clinton was stoked by Suge, by the assassination attempt, by the press and his rivals. Where Pac’s earlier work had described the experiences of those who were fleeing the law or the feds or death, now all those things were rendered in the first person. On October 12, 1995, Pac was released from jail. He flew to Los Angeles and immediately started recording. On his first night out, he cut one song called “I Ain’t Mad at Cha,” a heartfelt elegy for an incarcerated friend finding Islam, and regards the growing distance between them with a mixture of pain and pride. But there was another song from that first madcap session, something sparse and sinister that would eventually open the album. He starts it in a whisper: “You don’t wanna fuck with me.” ~~ At the height of its power, Death Row operated out of Can-Am Studios, a complex in Tarzana, Calif., just over the hills from L.A. All that Suge surveyed was red: the walls, the couches, the chairs. On the floor was a red carpet, with the label’s logo outlined in white; the understanding was that no one could tread on the logo, a residual superstition from Knight’s days as a defensive end in Division I football. From the moment he landed in California, Tupac wrote and recorded at an incredible pace. Some artists who worked alongside him during this period, like Nate Dogg, later suggested that this was so Pac could quickly satisfy his contract with Death Row and leave the label. It’s also possible he simply felt the clock ticking on his time as a free man. By 1996, that fatalism had begun to engulf nearly all of Pac’s writing; he was also keenly aware that he was out on bail, and a return to prison was a very real possibility. Whether or not the Nate Doggs of the world were right about Pac wanting to burn through his Death Row obligations, there’s something almost Old World about the relationship Tupac traced between art and money. This is a superstar who was relying on expense money to eat, someone whose temporary freedom had been granted, magnanimously, in exchange for his art. When he says, on “Can’t C Me,” “If this rappin’ bring me money, then I’m rapping till I’m paid,” it warps the archetypal rapper-label relationship, and Suge comes out looking like a particularly brutal Medici. Whatever the reason, Pac was working off the cuff, and he demanded the same from his collaborators. He challenged guest rappers to have their verses ready after giving them mere minutes to write—if they didn’t finish crafting something, or if they couldn’t nail it on the first take, they’d be cut from the song. The only artist who escaped this fate was Snoop Dogg, who slipped out of the studio to perfect his verses from “2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted.” All of this gave All Eyez on Me the feel of a furious storm. “Heartz of Men,” which opens with the stutter from Prince’s “Darling Nikki,” is about that breathlessness: From the opening ad-libs (“Ay Suge, what I tell you, nigga—when I come out of jail what was I gonna do? I was gonna start digging into these niggas’ chests right?”) until the climactic “Tell the cops to come and get me,” there’s barely a pause, certainly never a second thought. Pac’s greatest strength as a writer was his ability to isolate emotions: to identify them within himself, to evoke them in listeners, and to convincingly ascribe them to the characters he rendered, be they imaginary Brendas or caricatured Biggies. While he was an endlessly complex individual, Pac liked to choose one gut feeling and blow it up to its technicolor extreme—never to the point where it became unbelievable, but he had little interest in hedging himself or tacking on qualifiers. On All Eyez, that impulse, combined with the pace and method and recording (and with his legal situation, and with his mounting paranoia), made for an alchemic blend of horror, fate, and defiance. During the sessions he was an omnivore, swallowing up sounds from his youth or his periphery, borrowing the syntax of those who floated in and out of Can-Am, distilling his collaborators’ most painful life stories for 30-second cameos. That’s what he coaxed out of Napoleon from the Outlawz on “Tradin War Stories”: a 10-bar verse about the day when, as a 3-year-old, he saw his parents murdered in front of him. “Got My Mind Made Up” might as well have been a Wu-Tang song. The album’s second disc, which is packed with guests like E-40, C-Bo, and Richie Rich, is practically a love letter to Bay Area hip-hop: not only the self-consciously political tradition that Pac came of age in, but also the swaggering, eccentric stuff that was seeping out of Vallejo. There are two factors that help to unify such a sprawling, ambitious album full of disparate pieces. The first comes from the album’s phenomenal post-production and mixing. Sixteen of the 27 beats are credited to either Daz or Johnny “J,” each of whom delivers a career-defining performance. But All Eyez benefits greatly from DJ Quik, who was forced, due to contractual red tape, to work mostly under his government name, David Blake. Only “Heartz of Men” is officially a Quik beat, but the Compton legend did a significant amount of mixing and remixing. As varied as the sounds themselves are, the album has a uniformity of texture, and elegies like “Life Goes On” and larks like “Check Out Time” foreground their shared DNA. Pac’s relationship with Dre never gelled like Suge had hoped. Dre had planned to use a solo version of “California Love” as his next lead single, but Suge’s edict that the best work of every Death Row artist be cannibalized for Pac’s album tabled that idea indefinitely. So All Eyez on Me is in the curious position of having its lead single included only as a remix with an entirely different beat. Though Dre’s other contribution to the album, the George Clinton-assisted disc-two opener “Can’t C Me,” is a highlight, the musical chemistry far outpaced their personal bond. The other element that helps connect all these disparate threads is Pac’s increasingly singular rapping style. Since 1993’s jagged, Public Enemy-indebted Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., he had known precisely what worked for him. But on All Eyez, the component parts of his formula—voice, cadence, mixing, energy—cohere into something powerful, accessible, but inimitable. To go back to “2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted”: Listen to the interplay between Snoop’s silk and Pac’s sandpaper, one rapper slipping over the beat, the other clawing his way through it. The 21st-century notion that Tupac was an unexceptional technical rapper is absurd; some of his simplest approaches require incredibly powerful performances. He was a master of mounting tension, giving full dimension to words that would fall flat with from the mouth of anyone else. That clarity of style and identity allows All Eyez to spiral out in the grimmest and most lighthearted directions without ever losing its focus. And so there are moments like the end of “All About U” where Snoop, curled up in a bathrobe, flips through the channels and cross-compares the Million Man March with Montell Jordan videos, but five songs later, Pac lets “No More Pain” bludgeon the listener into a sort of hollow hypnosis. The sugary “Thug Passion” slides right into the sober “Picture Me Rollin,” “I Ain’t Mad at Cha” into the incomprehensibly filthy “What’z Ya Phone #.” All Eyez on Me is just as political as Tupac’s first two albums, which dealt with national politics in more overt terms. Pac’s writing is inherently and inescapably political, and his feelings about prison, about race, and about America permeate nearly every verse. On songs about video models, he slips in lines like “Life’s hell for a black celebrity.” Take this to its logical end: “How Do U Want It,” the gleefully sleazy single with K-Ci & JoJo, features a mid-song tangent about Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, and C. Delores Tucker. For Tupac in 1996, sex would inevitably be wrapped up with politics and freedom. The sexual abuse conviction that landed Pac in Clinton Correctional Facility has been documented exhaustively. In November 1993, Tupac and several associates of his sexually assaulted a woman in a New York hotel. A year later, he and his road manager were convicted of first-degree sexual abuse. (Each was acquitted on related sodomy and weapons charges.) Tupac was sentenced to one and a half to four and a half years in prison, with the possibility of parole after the first 18 months. Through the trial, Pac adamantly maintained his innocence. While the case is the subtext for much of Me Against the World, he addresses it head-on only in fleeting moments (“Who you callin’ rapist?”). What’s curious about All Eyez on Me is that Tupac raps so ravenously about, well, fucking. Two of the first three songs are about sex, and the fifth is “How Do U Want It“; then there’s “Phone #,” the conceit of which is “here’s a lot of phone sex.” It is defiant and it is tone-deaf; it is baiting those who believed the charges and it is an attempt to will something out of existence. All of it was of a piece with personal feuds and paranoias. When “How Do U Want It” was pushed as the album’s third single, one of its B-sides, the anti-Bad Boy screed “Hit Em Up,” became perhaps the most famous diss track of the ’90s. Following the shooting at Quad Studios in Manhattan, Pac had become convinced that his former friend, Biggie, was involved in plots to kill him. And so you get Pac lashing out, taunting his rivals, trying to clear Biggie’s wife Faith Evans’ vocals for a song on All Eyez. But you also hear a chest-crushing fear come through on songs like “Holla at Me.” In August 1996, just two weeks before his assassination, Pac was doing a press junket for Gang Related, the last movie he would ever act in. Someone asked him about his name. He talked about a man named Tupac Amaru II, who in 1780 led a revolt against Spanish colonists and what was effectively an economy of slave labor that exploited the native populations. In the centuries since, the uprising has been mythologized by some of those fighting for indigenous rights or independence throughout Latin America; in his own time, Amaru was marred by rumors of his uneven control over the rebels, with stories of brutal looting and violence dirtying his reputation and eroding support. Eventually, two of his officers betrayed him, and he was captured. He was sentenced to watch his wife, son, and other relatives be executed, after which he was to be drawn and quartered in the town square. His tongue would be cut out and his severed head would be displayed on a stake. Pac talked about this—the revolution, the betrayal, the execution. Then he composed himself. “People ask me what my name means, and I don’t tell ’em like Tupac Amaru,” he said. “I just say it means ‘determined,’ because I’m determined to never, ever negotiate again.” All Eyez on Me was likewise without compromise—an exhaustive survey of Tupac’s brain matter at the most harrowing time in his young life. It captures him at his most vulnerable and provocative. He executes an array of styles at an almost impossibly high skill level that never feels like an exercise in form. What could have been (and perhaps what was) a creative work made out of obligation turned into a bloodletting, a remarkable final document from one of his era’s defining voices. And yet for all the mania and fury, the best revenge Tupac exacted against enemies—those real and imagined—came when he was at his coolest and most controlled. Tucked into the back half of the second All Eyez on Me disc, “Picture Me Rollin’” is that proverbial eye of the storm. Pac opens the song rapping about frayed nerves and federal surveillance, then cedes the floor to CPO and Big Syke for several minutes. When he comes back in, it’s for a satisfied, almost tranquil monologue. He’s waving at Clinton Correctional from the outside—he sneers at the punk police, the crooked C.O.s. The District Attorney who tried his case is “that bitch.” He wants to know: Can you see me? Can you see me from there? But his last words take on a sort of phantom quality. Pac’s surely talking to the guards who wish he was still under their thumb when he says: “Anytime y’all wanna see me again, rewind this track right here. Picture me rollin.’”",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2pac-all-eyez-on-me/,"Death Row,Interscope",1996.0
34,Fleetwood Mac,Fleetwood Mac,Rock,9.0,January 27 2018,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,"Fleetwood Mac existed for nearly a decade prior to the release of Fleetwood Mac in 1975 but not in a manner that modern audiences would recognize. The story of how Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks transformed the British blues band anchored by drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie is well and often told in countless documentaries, retrospectives, and such reissues as this new triple-CD/single-DVD Super Deluxe Edition. Repetition has curdled this fascinating tale, rendering happy accidents as the work of divine providence, but by adding a disc of rough alternate takes along with a disc of live material, this Super Deluxe Edition helps make the familiar seem fresh once again. Tired though it may be, the prehistory of Fleetwood Mac is essential to understanding the album because the record exists at the intersection of two very different rock’n’roll aesthetics. By the time 1975 rolled around, the Mac were survivors. Mick and John—the two constants in the band since its inception through today—had the luck to work with two troubled guitar geniuses. Peter Green dominated the group’s earliest and bluesiest records, eventually succumbing to LSD right around the time his cohort Jeremy Spencer abandoned music for a religious cult. Neither departure was clean, but guitarist Danny Kirwan acted as a bonding agent for the band until they found Bob Welch, a rocker with a sentimental streak who seemed content to linger in the amorphous space separating AOR rock and adult contemporary pop. If all this turnover wasn’t confusing enough, the band had to combat an imposter Fleetwood Mac assembled by their former manager. All these names have wound up as footnotes to Fleetwood Mac history because Mick Fleetwood happened to fall for a demo from the unknown SoCal singer/songwriters Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. If producer Keith Olsen, who helmed Buckingham Nicks’ self-titled 1973 album, never played Mick that tape, odds are good Fleetwood Mac would’ve wound up hiring some other hotshot blues guitarist. Instead, Fleetwood wound up finding something he’d later call “IT” within Buckingham Nicks, a folk-rock duo whose music shared almost no similarities to the albums Fleetwood Mac made prior to 1975. The one possible musical connection between the two groups was the melodicism of Christine McVie, a singer-songwriter who played piano with the blues combo Chicken Shack prior to her marriage to John. Once they were bride and groom, Christine officially joined the band in 1971, contributing appealingly soft and hooky counterpoints to the spacey rock of Kirwan and Welch. Nevertheless, there was no clear analog in the Fleetwood Mac discography to the dreamy folk of Nicks and the barbed pop perfectionism of Buckingham, sounds that were as distinctly American as Fleetwood Mac’s blues jams were British. Buckingham Nicks were also survivors of languishing in musical limbo the West Coast, but were not quite naive upstarts when they accepted Fleetwood’s offer to join Fleetwood Mac: they had been playing the same game for just as long as the Mac, only in a different league. That’s why the 1975 album called Fleetwood Mac—the group’s second album to be named after the band; according to David Wild’s liner notes in the 2018 Super Deluxe Edition, fans apparently distinguish it from its predecessor by calling it “the White Album” but it’s hard to imagine there are many listeners who bother with such a distinction—feels like a debut: the unexpected intersection of two parallel spheres offers something genuinely new. Listening to Fleetwood Mac now, decades after it turned the group into superstars, it still seems fresh, unlike any other of its 1975 peers, and that’s all due to how the band merged two aesthetics. Fleetwood Mac, especially in the years following Peter Green’s departure, were something of a mood band, achieving a hazy, spacious vibe that lacked definition. Buckingham Nicks were their counterparts, focused not just on the precision of songs but also productions: their 1973 album captures nascent versions of the two singer/songwriters, where Nicks’ delicateness is balanced by Buckingham’s manic perfectionism. Buckingham did attempt to get Fleetwood Mac to march to his beat—legend has it he was attempting to tell John how to play a part until the bassist put the hammer down, telling Buckingham that the band was named after him—but wound up settling for compromise, assisting Nicks and Christine in deepening their compositions, while his band gave soul and elasticity to his tightly wound songs. Such synthesis is the appeal of Fleetwood Mac, in part because it’s assembled from so many lingering ideals from the ’60s: hippie mysticism, pop practicalism, R&B grooves, and rock rebellion all molded into music that is simultaneously professional, personal, commercial, and eccentric. By piling on alternate takes, single edits, and live material, the Super Deluxe Edition underscores how Fleetwood Mac worked at achieving this fusion. Maybe the early versions are rough, but they feel kinetic because the band is figuring out just who they were. Even better is the live material, where the band navigates the distance between their early blues roots and newly discovered immaculate pop. Because he plays lead guitar and sings, Buckingham winds up dominating, but the wonderful thing about these versions of “Oh Well” and “The Green Manalishi (With the Two Pronged Crown)” is that they’re blues tunes fronted by a musician whose instincts pushes him in the opposite direction of the blues, which gives these performances a thrilling energy. Even if the bonus material is worthwhile, the music that remains marvelous is the proper album. Perhaps its origins are in leftovers—many of the songs were originally intended for a planned second Buckingham Nicks album, “Crystal” is revived from the first, the brilliant power pop of “Blue Letter” is taken from the unheralded Curtis Brothers—but the Fleetwood Mac feels unified because this album is an album of convergence. Every element of the album teems with boundless possibilities, so much of which could be found in the absolutely bewitching Nicks-helmed “Rhiannon,” which is why Fleetwood Mac seems thrillingly alive and resonant longer after it has been absorbed into our collective consciousness.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fleetwood-mac-fleetwood-mac/,Warner Bros.,1975.0
35,Craig David,The Time Is Now,Pop/R&B,5.5,January 25 2018,Andy Beta,Contributor,"A single phrase—“Bo selecta”—encapsulates both the peak and the nadir of the British singer Craig David’s career. It  was the anthemic refrain of his breakout performance on the Artful Dodger’s 1999 garage classic “Rewind”—a song that launched David to instant stardom, followed by his 2000 debut, Born to Do It, released when he was just 19. (A decade later, it remained the fastest-selling debut album by a male solo artist in the UK.) David soon crossed over into the U.S. charts with “Fill Me In” and “7 Days,” showing how UK club music, hip-hop, R&B, and pop could all intermingle. But it was “Bo’ Selecta!”—a TV show in which the stand-up comedian Leigh Francis donned an obnoxious rubber mask to play the singer—that soon set the singer’s career on a downward spiral. After a questionable album of Motown covers, Craig David decamped to Miami, where he no doubt heard the blueprint for his hybrid hits revisited by artists like Drake and Justin Bieber. But he was greeted as a survivor by the UK press with 2016’s Following My Intuition, and now he follows up with his seventh album, The Time Is Now. At this point, though he is only 36, David occupies the role of something like an elder statesman, having weathered both a cultural backlash and a collaboration with Sting. But outside of a few tracks where he sounds reinvigorated, he’s not quite sure how to fit in to the present pop landscape. The Time Is Now finds Craig David fishing for a current trend—or three—to sink his hooks into, and across 15 tracks, he lands a few. He teams up with producer Jonas Blue (responsible for that tropical house remake of “Fast Car”) for the bantamweight “Heartline,” where his purr melds into the downy backdrop of tropical-house marimbas and defanged ratchet snares. It all might blow away at the slightest gust did the singer not convey just enough emotional heft to keep it grounded. David is most successful when he finds collaborators who push him into new territory. Kaytranada makes a slick R&B groove hiccup for “Live in the Moment,” while D.C. rapper GoldLink’s double-time delivery adds a bit of grit to the singer’s honeyed hook. However unintentionally, the fact that he has known both the highs and lows of fame makes David’s carpe diem advice actually feel earned. But on “I Know You,” David acts like someone who has mistakenly stumbled into the EDM tent. Part of the blame falls to producer Fraser T. Smith, who has credits on five of the album’s tracks. While his production for Adele and Stormzy shows that Smith can do both anthemic pop and rugged grime tracks, here, and on songs like “Love Me Like It’s Yesterday,” he falls back on tired tropes like generic filter sweeps and door-chime keys. Breezy tropical house, Latin-tinged stabs at replicating “Despacito,” EDM-friendly drops, Auto-Tuned croons—David dabbles in all of it like a man half his age. Consider “For the Gram,” a car crash of his most cringeworthy tendencies. Singing about Instagram, he awkwardly attempts to out-Drake Drake (whose own blend of hip-hop and R&B itself owes something to David’s turn-of the century suavity) with lines about hashtags, emoji, and sliding into DMs. For an album called The Time Is Now, David spends too much of his time looking like he's trying to catch up.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/craig-david-the-time-is-now/,"Insanity,Sony",2018.0
36,Betty Davis,Nasty Gal,Pop/R&B,8.4,January 10 2018,Rebecca Bengal,Contributor,"A decade ago, Light in the Attic set about reissuing the long dormant, early ’70s funk catalog of Betty Davis, starting with her self-titled 1973 opus. That album featured her standout “Anti Love Song,” a cover photo of the singer wearing a pair of thigh-high silver platform boots that Rick James probably wished he could have borrowed, and a backing band culled from a large swath of the Family Stone. Moving on to albums They Say I’m Different, Nasty Gal, and the previously unreleased Is It Love or Desire and Betty Davis: The Columbia Years 1968–1969, the whole project sought to clue in new audiences to the legacy of a singer formerly footnoted as the second wife of Miles Davis, who is said to have convinced her husband to change his tamer album title to Bitches Brew. Now, her 1976 album Nasty Gal, with its equally unsubtle title, is being released once again, this time as a long player. While the physical gratification of a deluxe vinyl treatment is reason enough for a new edition, it also marks a new occasion for listening, even more deeply and resonantly than its first reissue nine years ago. What does it mean to be an artist ahead of her time—twice in her lifetime? In 1975, despite label support and heavy touring, Island Records’ release of Nasty Gal failed to take off in the way those behind it had hoped; shortly after, Davis receded from the public eye. Now at 72, she is the subject of a recent documentary (Betty - They Say I’m Different opened in Amsterdam in November) and otherwise leads a very private life in Pittsburgh. “I even turned your head around now,” Davis unleashes in the titular song, with characteristic formidable, seductive delivery, in what sounds now like lyric self-fulfilling prophecy. “You said I love you every way but your way/And my way was too dirty for you now.” In 2009, Nasty Gal continued the job of contextualizing Davis, placing her among peers like Parliament and the Isley Brothers; acknowledging her imprint on musicians from Rick James (“She was what funk was,” he has said), Chaka Khan and Lil’ Kim to Royal Trux’s Jennifer Herrema and, especially, on Prince, who said of Davis to a reporter in 2012: “This is what we aim for.” To listen the record now—when the album shares a name with both a fashion brand inspired by Davis’ provocative, space-age style and a widely reclaimed slur uttered by the president of the United States—is another thing entirely. Nasty Gal is still as revolutionary and unbending as it was in 1975. In another preternaturally self-aware moment, amid the deep grooves of “F.U.N.K.,” Davis willfully seizes her place in the wider canon of funk, soul, and R&B: “Help me, Barry White!” she calls out and goes on to shout out to “Isaac Hayes, y’all,” Al Green, the O’Jays, Stevie Wonder, Tina Turner, and Ann Peebles, and ultimately, her good friend Jimi Hendrix (to whom she famously introduced her ex-husband; Miles doesn’t merit a shout-out in this anthem). The musical roots of Betty Davis, née Betty Mabry, are not widely acknowledged in North Carolina, but she and the band she put together have deep ties to Reidsville, once a town of textile mills and cigarette factories founded on the border of Little Troublesome Creek (Davis also spent a lot of her childhood in Durham, N.C., where she leaned heavily on her grandmother’s record collection): “B.B. King, Jimmy Reed, Elmore James and all those people,” she once said. “I know some English guitarist who would love to get their hands on it.” Around the age of 12, she wrote her first song, “I’m Gonna Bake That Cake of Love.” The Mabrys moved to Homestead, Pa. where her father got a job in steel-boom Pittsburgh, and at 16, Davis took off for New York City. When she spotted her future husband at a club in the Village, she didn’t recognize the jazz trumpeter, but she liked his style; as the story goes, she told a friend she wanted to meet the “dude with the shoes.” On Nasty Gal, her prowling caterwaul snakes and oozes through the album, over dirty bass and deep grooves. She trades lyrics with keyboardist Fred Mills on the raw, declarative statement of “Nasty Gal” and over a heavy riffing guitar on “Talkin Trash.” Image was central to the music: On the cover of Nasty Gal, Davis sheds her cosmic leotards and short-shorts for lacy lingerie and fishnets. She recruited a backing band from her home state—drummer Nicky Neal and bassist Larry Johnson were first cousins, Fred Mills lived in her hometown, and she added Carlos Morales on guitar. Davis choreographed their stage moves and insisted the band members play shirtless; she lathered the band members in baby oil so their muscles would shine under the lights. She wanted to change their name from Funkhouse to the Sleazes. Nasty Gal is certainly in service of sleaze and of sex, but first and foremost, to classic, solid dance grooves that pulse under Davis’ snarl on “Shut Off the Light,” her bedroom vocals on “Getting Kicked Off, Havin Fun,” and the saucy, sultry “The Lone Ranger.” Davis has been chastised by some critics for her reliance on that howl; it’s her weapon of seduction and also her line of defense. But on this album, she briefly and astonishingly reveals a wider range. “You and I,” a lover’s lament about the impossibility of reconciliation co-written with Miles and arranged by Gil Evans, features a trumpet solo by him and orchestration by Gil Evans. It’s a gorgeously steamy slow burner of a ballad, the most lyrical song on the album, and feels spilled out of an open window on some city night. It’s Davis at her most vulnerable, as she sings, “I love you I love you I love you/But it’s so hard for me to be me I wish I could give to you/I’d be free I’d be free I’d be free.” And it’s also fleeting, followed immediately by the revved-up “Feelins,” which delivers Davis back to her foundational structure of gritty, fearless seduction over a strutting, percolating rhythm. It’s tempting to wonder what might have been had Davis chosen or had the support to continue her career and perhaps to forge together some of these two poles of her work—the tough and the tender. Davis rose to fame but not widespread acceptance in an era when black women in this country were allowed to be seen but not heard—and certainly not to exercise artistic control as a musician. In the 1970s, the Rolling Stone Record Guide called Nasty Gal the work of a “black Marlene Dietrich”—a twisted show of admiration. But plenty of black audiences weren’t ready for Davis either—the NAACP urged a boycott of her work on the grounds that it perpetuated negative stereotypes about African Americans. For a woman, and especially a black woman in America in 1975, to openly sing about desire and sex with such ferocious power was most definitely ahead of the times. Even The New York Times, a year before Nasty Gal, acknowledged that Davis’ day would eventually arrive: “Miss Davis is trying to tell us something real and basic about our irrational needs, and Western civilization puts its highest premiums on conformity and rationality and rarely recognizes the Bessies or the Bettys until they’re gone.” May the record stand corrected.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/betty-davis-nasty-gal/,Light in the Attic,1975.0
37,Lil Wayne,Dedication 6,Rap,5.8,January 4 2018,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"The earliest installments in the Dedication mixtape series have a special place in internet mixtape mythology. The first was a prototype, the second is among the greatest mixtapes of all time, and each one since has helped to cement Wayne’s legacy as an imaginative and unstoppable rap force. Few rappers have made mixtapes more essential to their reputations and discographies, and these not only defined an era but helped to rewrite the rulebook on how to become a superstar in a digital age. (No wonder Chance the Rapper often cites the New Orleans legend as his “biggest inspiration.”) The tapes revealed a prolific artist at the peak of his powers paired with a DJ that knew how to edit him. “Weezy and Dram’—We are the Mixtape Blueprint,” Drama shouts in the opening seconds of Dedication 6, reminding listeners of their pedigree. Dedication mixtapes are always constructed in the same way: furious, back-to-back one-liners rapped over the beats of the moment—in this case Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO Tour Llif3,” 21 Savage’s “Bank Account,” JAY-Z’s “The Story of O.J.,” Kendrick Lamar’s “DNA.,” and more—a rap gauntlet designed to challenge him and measure his raps against those of his most popular peers. In his prime, Lil Wayne would completely reclaim a beat as his own and there was a sense of ease to the process, like elaborate thoughts were just pouring out of him as though he could go on forever. The first installment in four years, Dedication 6 is a calculated return to a recognizable brand during the most tumultuous period in Wayne’s storied, two-decade career, both artistically and financially. In this time of turmoil, he returns to the well, mostly rapping about Wraiths, jump-offs, and codeine as a numbing agent. The process seems less like it could go on forever and more like it’s merely running on a loop. Wayne got a lot of mileage out of his raps and isn’t all out of tricks just yet, but he’s slowing. “I been walkin’ on this fuckin’ water for a long time,” he raps on the highlight “XO Tour Life,” pointing to a decade of otherworldly performances. Even he seems to recognize the pace is unsustainable. This is a different Wayne than the one who seemed to unspool endless, enchanting yarns, who had a panoramic understanding of both pop culture and street culture. This Dedication does little to course-correct Lil Wayne’s spiraling career trajectory. Wayne’s promising run of 2016 features—from Solange’s “Mad” to Chance’s “No Problem”—showed he was still capable. His rapping was less intuitive and his non sequiturs could be grating, but he still has the same instincts. Sometimes muscle memory kicks in and he delivers a devastating string of bars, something as vivid as, “This is that codeine overkill/My mud colder than Soldier Field,” or a new angle like, “You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla/Then I roll a blunt ‘bout as thick as a Samoan.” But for every punch as delightfully unorthodox as “Boyz 2 Menace”’s “Kush loud as Fred screamin’ ‘Wilma!’ nigga,” there are a handful that are too easy to anticipate or that just don’t connect. Spontaneity used to be a driving force in Wayne’s world, but the punchlines on Dedication 6 are mechanical and the ideas within are rudimentary or sometimes incomplete. He uncorks some of the most eyebrow-raising conceits on nearly the entire first verse of “Fly Away”—performed over Kendrick’s “DNA.”—as a play on acronyms and letters, fumbling basic premises: Easy (Eazy) like NWA, treating beef like USDA, beating foes up like MMA or getting felt up like TSA. The set-up telegraphs the punch. There are many couplets as stale and stupid as “I got two keys of that Bieber/Call ‘em Justin and Justina.” The only real surprise is that his embarrassing raps can still find new, unexplored levels of embarrassment. Wayne was once the master of the “so clever it’s hard to believe no one has rapped it before” bar, and there are still some of those mixed in (“Bullet showers lead to bloodbaths,” or, “Treatin’ medication scrips like some Revelation scripts”). But there’s a thin line between the eureka moment of perfectly articulating a concise turn of phrase and just artlessly heaving jokes against a wall. Wayne gets in trouble attempting to connect every idea that pops into his head in this way; when every bar has to be a clever quip, you’re bound to mass-produce clunkers. He ends up with reaches like, “I rob his ass like Robin Givens,” and corny parallels like, “My trashiest hoes clean as fuck.” No song is without several of these bloopers, most songs are inundated by them, and while the tape is more or less a Christmas Day gift for fans, these sequences shouldn’t constantly derail the momentum, especially when the Wayne mixtape blueprint has always been about fluidity and his breathtaking, death-defying stream-of-consciousness. The raps themselves are hit or miss, but Lil Wayne is still rapping like a man seeking freedom on Dedication 6, fighting to reestablish a dialogue with listeners and to escape from label purgatory. (The mixtape was released exclusively on DatPiff and withheld from streaming, likely because of Wayne’s ongoing battle with Cash Money over his right to make money off his music without the label.) Given all he’s been through and all he’s done, it’s hard not to root for him, and the verses do track better here than on recent projects. He’s locked in on “New Freezer,” “My Dawgs” and “Blackin Out,” where whiny flows either explode into shrieks or dissolve into mumbles. The main problem is simply this: He’s run out of interesting ways to say he’s drugged up and horny. The same patented mixtape formula that made him a star and luminary exposes the limitations of a now one-dimensional method that's wearing thin.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-wayne-dedication-6/,Young Money Entertainment,2017.0
38,Rage Against the Machine,Rage Against the Machine,Metal,9.1,December 17 2017,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"At the beginning, Rage Against the Machine were relentless. It was 1990, and Tom Morello was a struggling rock guitarist in Los Angeles, with a Harvard degree in social studies. He had a vision to funnel the unrest of the day—the Gulf War, the prospective end of apartheid, the collapse of the Soviet Union—and his galvanizing experiences as a Kenyan-American kid in suburban Illinois into a group that synthesized rock and rap into something inherently rebellious. Or, as he put it in a want ad, he required “a socialist frontman who likes Black Sabbath and Public Enemy.” A year later, he found his spark, the complete creative complement who shared his systematic disillusionment, anarchic interests, and multiracial experiences. A scrawny 21-year-old punk with an unruly tuft of dreadlocks and a stiff upper lip, Zack de la Rocha had been shuttled for many of his teenage years between divorced parents in tough East Los Angeles and the more affluent and pale Irvine. His father was a famed Mexican muralist, his mother a “half-Chicano/half-German” teacher’s aide, as he put it. He liked a jumble of music, from the flutter of Charlie Parker to the esprit of Run-D.M.C. and hardcore. In high school, his white friends rejected him when they caught him breakdancing on the football field. But the moment de la Rocha stepped into a rehearsal room with Morello, drummer Brad Wilk, and de la Rocha’s childhood bandmate bassist Tim Commerford, the chemistry was instant and undeniable. “It was this kind of intense electricity that I hadn’t really felt before,” Wilk remembered. “Everyone in the band was fully on that trip.” Within weeks of forming, Rage Against the Machine—a name lifted from an abandoned tune in de la Rocha’s last band—had recorded a 12-song demo of originals, pieced together largely from fragments in de la Rocha’s journals and song structures Morello had contemplated for years. By the end of 1991, they were navigating major-label offers. By the middle of 1992, they were recording their self-titled debut in a string of fancy Los Angeles studios. Seven of those first demos reappear on Rage Against the Machine in almost identical form, de la Rocha’s vocals simply sharpened by veteran engineer Garth Richardson. The speed with which Rage wrote and recorded its first screeds is paramount to understanding why, now a quarter-century after its release, Rage Against the Machine remains an essential call to activism and a necessary lesson on how to withstand the opposition. While taking on the most powerful institutions of consolidated American power, Rage Against the Machine were having the time of their lives. You can hear it in most every note. Politics, however, seemed preeminent. Haunted by guitar lines that whir like air-raid sirens, “Bullet in the Head” takes aim at war-driven nationalism and an endemic unwillingness to think beyond the narratives of the nightly news and presidential addresses. “Take the Power Back” addresses the same problems in the classroom, lampooning the “one-sided stories for years and years and years” of a Eurocentric educational system. “Motherfuck Uncle Sam,” de la Rocha spits in one of his sharpest barbs, a perfect proclamation of defiant self-worth. “Step back. I know who I am.” And a good half of the album, from the eternally combative anthem “Killing in the Name” to the battle cry of “Know Your Enemy,” presciently speaks not only to a period of perceived federal overreach, from the streets of Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict to the mountains of Idaho during the Ruby Ridge standoff, but also to the coming tide of neoliberalism and its half-hearted promises. Rage Against the Machine is a symptom of its time, presented as a possible panacea. The political invective of Rage Against the Machine, though, has often overshadowed its arguably more essential quality, or at least the one that made hormonal suburbanites and buzzed undergraduates even give such issues the time of day: It is incredibly fun, not only for the millions who have since bought the album or chanted along to “Killing in the Name” live but also for the band itself. Just look at them, beaming on New Year’s Day in 1992. De la Rocha became his generation’s most dependably popular political lyricist, but on the band’s first ten tracks he seemed every bit as exuberant as outraged. In the opening triptych alone, he emphatically counts into “Bombtrack,” repeatedly grunts and shouts inside every rest within Morello’s iconoclastic solo during “Killing in the Name,” and demands that you the listener “Crank the music up” and that the band “Bring that shit in” before he’s even launched into the first verse of “Take the Power Back.” No matter how mad you may be, you don’t scream “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” against a collapsing din sixteen times without enjoying yourself. De la Rocha sounds entirely triumphant, a vexed-and-confused kid who has survived a difficult, discriminatory childhood to find the proper vent for his feelings. He’s an unflinching young emcee, too, starting a full third of the album as battle raps against the entire world. “Bombtrack” begins, for instance, with a threat against the simpletons who haven’t realized that rap can be a weapon, while he aligns himself with the spirit and purpose of the Black Panthers and EPMD at the jump of “Wake Up.” He dips into the dozens throughout the record, popping out of politics to reassert his overall authority. During “Know Your Enemy,” he brags about being “born with insight and a raised fist… born to rage against ’em,” the native son of cultural assimilation who now has the book learning, energy, and microphone skills to push back. He is ready for every fight on every level. As de la Rocha declares during “Bombtrack,” however, these would be just sketches in his notebook without his band; they provide the “dope hooks [that] make punks take another look.” The trio around him animates every idea, pushing what he’s selling with unwavering belief. The rhythmic undertow of “Township Rebellion”—where the bass plows through a cowbell-and-snare beat like a glacier through a narrow pass—is an ecstatic dance that practically vaults into the chorus that is the band’s best credo: “Why stand on a silent platform? Fight the war. Fuck the norm.” And at a time when a mix of rap and metal was just a novelty, Rage outlines its own complex, chimeric identity. Rising and falling with de la Rocha’s despair, “Settle for Nothing” traces the dynamic peaks and valleys of prog rock, even as it grows into a hardcore tantrum. On “Wake Up,” they pivot between worship of Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” and a delirious breakbeat, Morello scratching his guitar strings like he’s suddenly stepped behind the turntables. With ubiquitous funk bass and guitar theatrics, Rage sound, at times, goofy and unsophisticated. But the unselfconscious honesty in hearing these four navigate their shared interests in real time—and loving the process—is intoxicating. Rage Against the Machine became a better band on each subsequent album. Their landmark follow-up, 1996’s Evil Empire, is much more coiled and concise. Wilk and Commerford were perfectly heavy. Morello had found the fertile nexus between gargantuan riffs and idiosyncratic techniques that intrigued adolescent fans and Guitar Player obsessives alike. And on 1999’s The Battle of Los Angeles, their hard-nosed finale, de la Rocha is at the height of his polemical powers, rhyming in great hypertextual arcs of political pleas. Morello’s singular guitar style had developed to the point that Rolling Stone famously mistook his screeching “Guerrilla Radio” solo for a harmonica break. Never again, though, would the quartet sound so casually confident, as if they actually had the gusto and naiveté to take on the world. They recorded Rage Against the Machine in what felt like an instant; the next two albums took three and four years and never mounted the same sort of enthusiasm. By the time Rage cut Renegades, a farewell batch of covers from Cypress Hill and MC5 to Bob Dylan and Devo, they sounded exhausted and effete, drained by the process of being the planet’s most woke major-label band. All of this pressure, of course, wasn’t internal, or the result of some infinite great internal awakening. From the beginning, certain factions of Rage’s rapidly metastasizing fanbase saw the great paradox of the band’s peculiar situation: Here they were, purporting to be against the machine, while very much deepening the coffers of the machine thanks to a record that blew up as quickly as it had been made. Epic, after all, was then a subsidiary of Sony, the global electronics empire that not only profited from selling a Rage tape but also the very Walkman that played it. In cutting the checks, Rage’s patrons, some argued, had made capitalist cogs of the socialist rebels. In a representative moment, Rage launched a “Freedom Fighter of the Month” program toward the end of their run, intending to give a platform to a militia of assorted activists. One recipient confessed to Spin that he worried he’d compromised his cause by being but one chainlink away from a multinational corporation. “I was a little embarrassed, to be honest,” he said. “Maybe [Rage] aren’t as pure as they’d like to be, or as they’d like to look.” The so-called paradox, in retrospect, was puritanical scaremongering, an absurd ideological litmus test that gave more power to those already controlling the world than those wanting to change it by any means possible. And anyway, Rage had done exceptionally well during its brief independent trial, selling more than 5,000 copies of their demo at shows and through friends. When the label executives (including Madonna, who tried to ink them to Maverick) started showing up at rehearsals, Morello didn’t see the chance to get rich. He saw the mechanism for public broadcast. “It’s great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists,” he later said, “but it’s also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from Granada Hills to Stuttgart.” The resulting riches have sometimes felt embarrassing, as when de la Rocha ran a stoplight with a Rolling Stone reporter in a Ford Explorer as he headed to his new home in the hills of Los Angeles. But how else should Rage have done its bidding, especially at least a decade before the internet allowed easy worldwide distribution, or at least the promise of it? Should they have remained independent and preached their politics to a smaller network of the already converted, made redundant by someone else’s system of moral absolutism? Or should they have exploited an already-exploitative label system to seed extreme ideas in politically fallow places—a state-sponsored conspiracy, if you will, against itself? Consider this: Rage made just four music videos to promote their debut. The first, a grainy and heavily filtered live capture of “Killing in the Name,” could have served as the meet-cute concert setting for two California punks in some skate film. But the successors, for “Bombtrack” and “Freedom,” are pure four- and six-minute advertisements for unapologetically radical politics. As de la Rocha impugned the American educational system, jingoistic patriots, malleable media, and complacent suburbanites on the album itself, he largely avoided naming names or offering specific solutions, aside from taking direct aim at J. Edgar Hoover’s racist COINTELPRO during “Wake Up.” But these videos offered highly specific fights and fixes, putting a weaponized point to the record’s blunt rhetorical weight. During “Bombtrack,” Rage thrashes inside a steel cage flanked by heavily armed guards, mirroring the circumstances of Peruvian communist leader Abimael Guzmán. Two months before Rage Against the Machine arrived, the Peruvian government arrested Guzmán in an effort to suppress his Shining Path party, which had spread through the country’s nooks and crannies for two decades. Flying in the face of U.S. foreign policy at the time (and even now), Rage offered a sympathetic portrait of the Shining Path, framing it as a movement of Peruvian liberation against oppressive brutality. “The people continue their heroic struggle,” the screen reads as the rebels arm themselves and head into the Andes, each word offered in emphatic synchronization with Wilk’s Bonham-sized coda. But it’s the reel for “Freedom” that, a quarter-century later, still feels revolutionary, both in content and context. Rage plays in cramped quarters, pressed close to an audience that throbs to Wilk and Commerford’s militant thrum. “Freedom for [Leonard] Peltier,” reads the black banner at their backs, a demand on behalf of the American Indian Movement activist who received two life sentences for the murder of two FBI agents during a 1975 standoff at a South Dakota reservation.  As they play, scenes from the battle, its prelude, and its aftermath interweave with a flash-card history of federal land grabs from Native Americans. (The problem has been especially pernicious in southwestern South Dakota, where Mount Rushmore was etched into lands previously ceded in perpetuity to Peltier’s ancestors.) When the song peaks, de la Rocha howling “Freedom/Yeah, right” with his last bit of breath, the Lakotas march and arm and fly the United States flag upside down, at half-mast, and beside the American Indian Movement’s banner. It is a righteous moment that fades into explicit instructions for writing to the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee and helping. What’s more, Epic encouraged Rage to make this video when the company’s suits realized they needed something less profane than “Killing in the Name” to push on domestic radio and television. “Throughout Europe, South America, and Asia, the band had started to explode, partly because you have less censorship there… But not in the U.S., because we refused to edit for lyric content,” Morello remembered for Metal Hammer. “It was actually at [Epic’s] suggestion that the next single be a six-and-a-half-minute song without a chorus, and that we make a video for Leonard Peltier! That suggestion came from the record company, not the band, like they were trying to outflank us!” These weren’t superstar-studded compilations for AIDS relief or even polite benefits on behalf of Tibetan liberation, both very much en vogue as Rage ascended. No, Rage Against the Machine’s major-label gambit was an infomercial for justice and reconciliation for centuries of indigenous extermination, funded by a major label. When has that ever happened? And in an era when the president criticizes the free speech of theater companies and threatens to dismantle broadcast rights for networks he deems enemies of the state, can you imagine it happening again anytime soon? When I was a teenager, those videos Rage had made finally found me in rural North Carolina on the family farm, only after we had invested in an unsightly satellite dish. They were life-changing events, introductions to political protest and the personal empowerment it could engender. I have little doubt that, had Rage Against the Machine remained independent, I would have explored such ideas much later, if at all. And I have even less doubt that, had Rage not backed the ideology of “Bombtrack” or “Freedom” with a sense of liberation and enjoyment, those ideas would have likely held little sway. Watch the crowds in a live video from the band’s earliest era: It is sweaty and ecstatic, church camp for the future activists of the world and an indoctrination to the joy of potential change. Rage Against the Machine recognized that, until the institutional changes about which they wrote and spoke were actually implemented, they would be yelling about cultural pride and socialist ideals into the void—that is, unless they could co-opt the mechanics of capitalism and wield them. Twenty-five years later, in a world of broad media consolidation and Silicon Valley-powered megaphones, the need to do just that has only grown. But so have the possibilities for smart rebellion, for using the tools of the machine to weaken the core. “The test of whether Rage Against the Machine will be a successful band has nothing to do with album sales,” Morello told Guitar Player in 1994. “It’s going to have to do with the way the message translates into concrete action.” In the quarter-century since Epic issued Rage Against the Machine, the band’s subsequent self-seriousness and the dubious rap-metal that followed often turned it into a punchline. And amid the horrors of George W. Bush’s state surveillance and his continuation of his father’s war in the Middle East and the drone warfare under Barack Obama’s administration, it was hard not to feel like Rage had failed in that regard, like we had all failed. During the last year, though, Democratic Socialists have won local elections. Ordinary folks have taken to the streets, marching en masse to embarrass the president, and taken to the Internet to dislodge powerful men who are also molesters. And an awareness of and reckoning with cultural appropriation is no longer a sidebar but a real public discourse. No ten songs are responsible for that, of course. But for millions, Rage Against the Machine helped shape a spirit of necessary and electric defiance, of yelling out loud and over and over, “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me.” May it remain relentless.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rage-against-the-machine-rage-against-the-machine/,Epic,1992.0
39,Chris Stapleton,From A Room: Volume 1,Folk/Country,7.6,December 11 2017,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Chris Stapleton toiled for nearly 15 years to become an overnight sensation. After moving to Nashville in the early 2000s, he played in a bluegrass band and co-founded a Southern rock group whose only claim to fame was opening for Zac Brown, all while writing songs for artists like Luke Bryan, Darius Rucker, Blake Shelton, and Lee Ann Womack, among others. He tried his hand at a solo career, releasing a single in 2013 that went nowhere. In 2015, with a new breed of singer-songwriters challenging Nashville’s most ingrained conventions, Stapleton finally released a full album under his own name, Traveller. Revealing a vivid and economical songwriter as well as a soulful and sensitive singer, the album enjoyed only modest sales right up until the night of the Country Music Awards, when he performed with Justin Timberlake and took home the award for Album of the Year, beating out more established acts like Jason Aldean and Little Big Town. He woke up the next morning to a No. 1 album. In Nashville, a place where traditionalists are treated as the avant-garde, Stapleton quickly eclipsed many of the artists who had previously sung his songs. His success, however, isn’t based on how he envisions the future of country music, but rather how he uses the past. His sentiments and characters are familiar, occasionally giving way to generalities but usually bringing the dignified melancholy of old-school country right up to the present. Musically, he understands that “country” is an inclusive label, one that uses the bristly twang of 1970s outlaw as its foundation but also covers the excitable R&B from Memphis and the Shoals as well as the blues-based Southern rock of the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Two years after Traveller turned him into a Nashville institution, From a Room Volume 1 sounded like a non-follow-up when it came out in May: a way to release new music without having to make a big statement or one-up his debut. The tracklist was short, nine songs clocking in at just over 30 minutes. The packaging was minimal, a cardboard sleeve for the CD and a retro insert for the LP. The nondescript title carried a concealed pun, as all the songs were recorded in Room A at the historic RCA Studio in Nashville. Lending that indefinite article even more weight was the fact that the studio had been threatened with demolition while Stapleton was recording Traveller there. Someone thought condos would be a better use of that real estate. Vol. 1 works as a tribute to that studio, but Stapleton is as interested in personal history as he is in music history. He resurrected songs he’d written years before, some of which had been hits for other people, some of which had been overlooked completely. It sounded more like a minor reclamation project or an abbreviated career retrospective than an actual album, but with the release of From A Room Volume 2, the first collection comes more sharply into focus. Together, they reveal the full scope of his abilities, not only monetizing his vast catalog (he’s written approximately 1,000 songs) but filling in his biography for the uninitiated. As a songwriter, Stapleton rarely strays from country’s evergreen topics: breaking hearts, breaking the law, breaking the bank. But he tackles them with a graceful economy of language and fine gradients of emotion. Take “Either Way,” off Vol. 1, originally recorded by Lee Ann Womack on her 2008 album Call Me Crazy. Stapleton, accompanied only by an acoustic guitar, describes the romantic inertia between lovers who only talk “when the monthly bills are due.” He sings quietly on the verses, as though lost in thought, but his voice rises to a near-shout on the chorus: “We can just go on like this/Say the word, we’ll call it quits.” There’s not a happy ending. In fact, there’s not an ending at all. The last verse makes clear that nothing will change between them. Stapleton works well with resignation and regret, to the extent that even his raucous weed anthem “Them Stems,” off Vol. 1, offers a chicken/egg conundrum: Is the narrator’s life a shambles because he smokes too much pot, or does he smoke too much pot because his life’s a shambles? The people inhabiting these verses tend to live at the extremes, although the songs fare best when those extremes are familiar and relatable. The doomed inmate on Vol. 1 closer “Death Row” is less a character than an archetype, making it a peculiarly inconsequential contribution to country’s prison song genre. And the multiple generations of farmers on Vol. 2’s “Scarecrow in the Garden” are far less compelling and distinct than the pragmatic alcoholics on “Nobody’s Lonely Tonight,” a Vol. 2 standout. “What’s love but just some illusion we believe,” Stapleton sings, his tone both disgusted and resigned. “What’s love but just some confusion we don’t need.” He doesn’t mean it, of course. Vol. 2 leavens its heavier moments with songs that celebrate the simple joys of love and marriage and family, without lapsing into sentimentality. “Millionaire,” a cover of a song by fellow writer Kevin Welch, is about how love is worth more than money. “A Simple Song,” penned by Stapleton’s father-in-law, lists off a family’s escalating woes, which include bad health, poverty, and unemployment, until Stapleton admits, “But I love my life/Man, it’s something to see/It’s the kids and the dogs and you and me.” The idea of finding happiness in the face of hardship is not new in country music, and that’s the whole point. What has made him so successful is how Stapleton invests these ideas with gravity and gratitude.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chris-stapleton-from-a-room-volume-1-volume-2/,"Mercury Nashville,Mercury Nashville",2017.0
40,Sia,Everyday Is Christmas,Pop/R&B,5.8,December 5 2017,Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,"Ever since Sia transitioned from “Six Feet Under” coffeeshop songwriter to Top 40 fixture, her career has contained the tension between the writer she’s trained as and the pop star she’s become. Specifically, she has a habit of giving smart, bluntly candid interviews in songwriter mode that are, in pop mode, the exact wrong thing to say. A Billboard interview where she mentioned the “victim to victory” songwriting template of tracks like “Titanium” was thrown back at her, in the headline of a New York Times pan of This Is Acting and countless other reviews. So what was it like writing her first Christmas album? “[There’s a] shortage of good Christmas music… It's not like you have to have an original idea to begin with,” Sia told Zane Lowe. “It's like, Christmas, mistletoe, ho-ho-ho, Santa Claus, Christmas list, elves.” This is technically accurate, in the way that a professional elf might accurately describe Christmas gift-giving as “like, hammer, nails, molds, wrapping paper.” But it also kind of grinches up the business. Of course, there’s no shortage of existing Christmas songs—virtually every musician records them as a quick stocking-stuffer for music blogs and streaming sites—but most of them are strictly for diehard fans. As far as canonical Christmas songs, the past few decades have produced basically only two. There’s the “All I Want for Christmas Is You” school: festive (or “Extra Festive” or “SuperFestive!”, as Mariah Carey dubbed the re-recordings of her hit) and infectious, in both senses of the word. Then there’s the “Last Christmas” school, where Christmas is an incidental setting for smaller human dramas. There’s plenty of room for variation here, from the downright morose original versions of “White Christmas” and “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” to the acid-dipped tinsel of Dragonette’s “Merry Xmas (Says Your Text Message),” to the sumptuous femme-fatale drama of Saint Etienne’s “No Cure for the Common Christmas,” to the infinite takes on Wham!’s original. The latter’s also closest to Sia’s non-holiday music, where big pop songs like “Chandelier” are infused with an underlying darkness. It’s a strange choice, then, that Everyday Is Christmas is mostly played straight. Like Kelly Clarkson’s Wrapped in Red, the album was produced by Greg Kurstin, and his trademark shiny production becomes DEFCON 1 festive. “Candy Cane Lane” is colorful and lightweight. “Santa’s Coming for You” has an ironic title, but the only threat is being smothered by Christmas cheer. There are some lovely ballads, such as the lilting, “Unchained Melody”-esque “Snowman” and its sister light-jazz track “Snowflake” (only kind of ruined by the news of 2017 discoursing the word into oblivion), which linger on the season’s impermanence. But they’re the same metaphor, so the effect is muted by sequencing them right next to each other—or anywhere close to “Puppies Are Forever,” the sonic equivalent of having the Christmas stuffing squeezed out of you by a rictus-grinned Elmyra Duff. There’s plenty Sia could do with an album entirely of Christmas originals, but too many are underwritten; there’s more consistency in the art direction than the songwriting. “Underneath the Mistletoe” flirts with being candid about an obsessive holiday crush—“it’s Christmas time, so run for your life”—but abandons the idea almost immediately. Half of “Ho Ho Ho” wants to be a Christmas misfits’ anthem; the other half wants to be a Christmas version of “Chandelier,” with lots of booze, nothing to lose. The production, vaguely festive and vaguely pop-skanky, doesn’t commit to either. Sia’s got a self-own for this, too: “It was easy and fun. We did it in two weeks.” Of course, plenty of great albums were secretly written in two weeks, just like plenty of fine presents were secretly purchased on the eve of December 24. But it’s still like opening a gift where someone’s forgotten to remove the tags.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sia-everyday-is-christmas/,RCA,2017.0
41,Metallica,Master of Puppets,Metal,10.0,December 2 2017,Andy O'Connor,Contributor,"Before drummer Lars Ulrich even thought about acquiring Basquiats to auction off in the future, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett was most stoked on obtaining the first issue of the Fantastic Four comic, which established Marvel as a big name and is now estimated to be worth around $135,000. The unmitigated success of Master of Puppets, inarguably one of the greatest metal albums of all time, let him do that, and set him on a path from obtaining valuable pieces of pop culture to becoming an icon in the culture itself. When asked about why he wanted the rare comic, Hammett replied, “To obtain the unobtainable is a real rush in itself.” The lasting characteristics that took metal from its from heavier rock offshoot to its own distinct form were already taking shape by the time Metallica released their third album Master of Puppets in 1986. The Bay Area thrash scene where they originated—and quickly divested themselves from—was born from one of the most successful mergers in music: metal riffs and punk energy. Melody was increasingly prominent, bringing with it a wounded and raw beauty. Thrash also brought about an element of social consciousness, adding flourishes to British crust pioneers Discharge’s brute simplicity. Metal was both assimilated into pop culture and a bastion of musical expansion, a reimagination of progressive rock with more direct propulsion. It was music not content with its own alienation, ready to lash back as a big-tent alternative that demanded a deeper understanding. Will this reissue of Master of Puppets—a remastered and expanded box set, featuring studio outtakes and live performances from around the world and one of bassist Jason Newstead’s first shows at a club in Reseda, Cali.—convince you it’s the greatest metal record of all time, if you’re not convinced already? The numerous early takes and rough demos have a diehard appeal (there’s a reason Metallica has a dedicated archivist on their payroll), though the live recordings present a band going through its most monumental transition punctuated by monumental tragedy. Recording a masterpiece was the easy part. Genius does not appear out of thin air and Puppets was a culmination of Metallica’s influences and forward direction, so yes, it will give you a more rounded sense of how a masterwork came to be. That the early roughness stands starkly shows how relentless they were in making a defining metal record. Its predecessor, 1984’s Ride The Lightning, began with “Fight Fire With Fire,” a song fueled by nuclear paranoia, which was not at all uncommon in the ’80s. Puppets opens with “Battery,” a celebration of destruction as a liberating force, trading in commentary for a purely aspirational message, albeit one the heshers could revere. It’s basically “Fire” widened in philosophical scope and tightened in performance. In this way, Puppets wasn’t a radical break from Lightning. Both mostly follow a similar structure—acoustic intro, second song as title track, a “ballad” on the fourth song, a long instrumental—and yet Metallica were not copying themselves or refining their approach. They were crazy enough to think they could top Lightning, and they did. It’s what separated them from the rest of the thrash scene, and from most metal in general; they were the furthest thing from Def Leppard, but they wanted to push their own boundaries of metal as high art as much as Def Leppard was trying out-slick and out-pop their Los Angeles rivals. In hindsight, game recognize game. Metallica abandoned Los Angeles because they couldn’t hang with the pop bands there—all of those Decline of Civilization Part II Aqua Net rejects couldn’t fathom wanting to ascend to Metallica’s heights anyway. Puppets deals with the very nature of control, presenting the hangover of its allure. Metal is fight music for underdogs and while that is empowering and worthwhile, Puppets shows the consequences of control in the wrong hands. The title track was Hetfield warning himself about addiction, something he would become intimate with, and he wouldn’t listen until their 2004 tell-all documentary Some Kind of Monster made a tragic comedy out of Metallica’s near collapse while recording St. Anger. Through its raging rhythm and heart-wrenching valleys, where bassist Cliff Burton brought a distorted symphony of the mind, Hetfield’s pleas for sanity sure don’t sound like someone coming to grips with how fucked up he is. This isn’t unusual for cautionary drug songs, yet “Puppets” doesn’t sound like a morality play—“Master! Master!” is servitude delivered as arena unity, where you grow stronger, not indentured, by yelling it louder and louder. “Disposable Heroes” and “Leper Messiah” explore the illusion of control through more conventional topics—“Heroes” takes on war and “Messiah” skewers televangelists as any decent ’80s metal band would—and still manage to be more powerful than most bands at their best. Metallica embraced more complex structures without diluting themselves, a rare instance where a band gets more accessible by getting more complicated. Puppets’ fusion of beauty and savagery is best defined in its last two songs, “Orion,” an instrumental, and “Damage Inc.” Both tracks were co-written by Burton, effectively sealing his legacy that still looms over Metallica three decades later. His presence is strongest on “Orion,” making thrash move like ballet, a swelling motion that’s not just about crashing into things. The bridge takes the control motif and creates worlds with it, creating tenderness and majesty, showing what a man’s hand masquerading as divine can summon. “Orion” is celestial through meaning, not explicit text, Hawkwind’s high-mindedness combined with Lemmy’s more direct glance. “Damage Inc.” closes how “Battery” opened the album: reckless carnage as a cleansing, necessary fire. While it’s more of a contrast than fusion, they still coexist with a purpose to elevate metal. It’s even more apocalyptic than “Fight Fire With Fire”—there’s no mention of nuclear war, just a focus on getting mowed down for someone else’s survival. “Fuck it all, fucking no regrets” proved to be such an impactful line, Hetfield reused it again in 2003, on St. Anger’s title track with a teenager’s enthusiastic clumsiness. Nevertheless, Hetfield is, bar none, metal’s standout rhythm guitarist, handling blazing speed with a precision and heft. Metallica are so ubiquitous that this perhaps has gone under-recognized; hummable as his riffs are, and the legions of hummers massive, Hetfield’s role as frontman obscures his contributions as a guitarist. The rough mixes included in this deluxe reissue are mostly devoid of solos and vocals, and they become pantheons to Hetfield’s rhythm stature. It’s jarring to hear gaps where Hammett’s solos or Burton’s fills should be, and yet through him (and our collective memories) the songs still flow as they should. Hetfield-Hammett-Burton-Ulrich is one of the few metal lineups where every member was equally integral, where if you removed one, the band would be radically altered. Hetfield was the bond between everyone else, a ground to Burton’s ambitions and Hammett’s squalling lead work, a reason that Ulrich didn’t need to be flashy because he certainly couldn’t be. Puppets brought Metallica to their artistic climax, but its touring cycle proved a severe challenge to such loftiness. The live recordings here are closer to the tapes that Metallica made their reputation off of than the polished productions on the 1993 box set Live Shit: Binge & Purge, the cash-out from touring all corners of the globe. As demanding of perfection they were making Puppets, live they were still more concerned with tearing through, out-of-place leads be damned. Except for a 1987 VHS Cliff ‘Em All!, there weren’t a lot of official live recordings from this era, odd given how Metallica made their name as a live band. The live tracks here are rough, unpolished, but you can basically smell the beer and sweat from the band and the crowd throughout. Before Burton’s death from a bus accident in 1986 on tour in Sweden, Hetfield considered kicking out Ulrich, an alternate timeline that scores of metal fans might still wish into existence. Loving Metallica and hating Ulrich are not mutually exclusive; Metallica could make more money charging fans and ex-fans to spit on him than they ever did making music. Even as the fantasy lingers, it’s impossible to imagine Metallica without Ulrich. Puppets is the product of brashness with an eye towards heaven, and that’s Hetfield and Ulrich to a fault. And Hetfield was going to make that relationship work: he described early Metallica as the family that replaced his own, his mother died from treating cancer with Christian Science and his father abandoned him when he was young. Burton’s death reopened that feeling of abandonment, making him grip to control even more. Trying to obtain the unobtainable is not for the foolhardy, and it will drain you into a husk if you’re lucky. That’s what Hetfield tried to warn you about on Puppets by yelling at you about chopped breakfasts on mirrors: control is a deathwish that keeps you alive.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/metallica-master-of-puppets/,Blackened Recordings,1986.0
42,Taylor Swift,Reputation,Pop/R&B,6.5,November 13 2017,Jamieson Cox,Contributor,"For a decade, almost everyone agreed on Taylor Swift. She wrote exquisite love songs and scorching, funny takedowns at an age when most people struggle to put together a cogent email. She scattered breadcrumbs and winking clues through her lyrics and liner notes, inviting diehard fans and pop rubberneckers alike to agonize over what was fact and what was fiction. She won so many awards she was ridiculed for the shocked face she made every time her name was called. She was observant and savvy, and if those qualities were spun into a kind of Machiavellian cunning by her critics, it seemed like a good problem to have. How things have changed. The Swift that stands before us in 2017 is beleaguered and defensive, a figure fighting back from public relations problems she largely could’ve avoided. She stepped into back-and-forths with Nicki Minaj and her eternal nemesis Kanye West, when silence would have seemed optimal. She induced the Streisand effect by taking legal action over a barely-read blog post that drew connections between her work and neo-Nazism, a decision that shone a new spotlight on her steadfast apoliticism in an overheated political climate. And to top it all off, she released “Look What You Made Me Do,” a petty snarl of a lead single that jumped to No. 1 thanks largely to sheer anticipation. Chart watchers rejoiced when an ascendant Cardi B bumped her from the top slot; Taylor sent flowers. It turns out “Look What You Made Me Do” was closer to a red herring than a sign of things to come, a relief given how it neglected most of Swift’s generational gifts. Reputation, her sixth album, isn’t a tuneless vengeance tour—it’s an aggressive, lascivious display of craftsmanship, one that makes 1989 sound like a pit stop on the way to Swift’s full embrace of modern pop. (This is a trip that began the second the bass dropped on her 2012 song “I Knew You Were Trouble.”) She’s largely abandoned effervescence, wonderment, and narrative. Say goodbye to maple lattes and hello to whiskey on ice, to wine spilling in the bathtub, to Old Fashioneds mixed with a heavy hand. Her vision of pop, one she realizes with the help of Max Martin and Shellback, and man-of-the-moment Jack Antonoff, is surprisingly maximal: hair-raising bass drops, vacuum-cleaner synths right out of a Flume single, stuttering trap percussion, cyborg backing choirs. Songs like opener “...Ready for It?” and “Don’t Blame Me” are glittering monsters held together by Swift’s presence at their center. Her interest in hip-hop and R&B is most apparent in her voice, an instrument that’s been stripped of its signature expressiveness. Her best performances throughout Reputation are defined by cadence and rhythm, not melody: she’s cool, conversational, detached. These particular skills may have been hiding in plain sight—listen to the decade-old “Our Song” and focus on the way she places syllables while rattling off “Our song is a slammin’ screen door!”—but they’ve never been highlighted the way they are here. “Delicate” is built around a muted pulse and a murmured question: “Is it cool that I said all that? Is it chill that you’re in my head? ’Cause I know that it’s delicate.” She stretches out the titular compliment on “Gorgeous,” making it a fluttering prayer and letting the rest of the line tumble out in its wake. She even manages to hang with Future on the bizarre, compelling “End Game,” leaving poor Ed Sheeran in the dust: “I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be/Drinking on the beach with you all over me.” The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now—she’s posted up at a Cozumel cabana with her out-of-office reply: “I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put ’em.” Her writing has never been less diaristic or more dependent on dramatic performance. For Swift, plunging head-first into pop has meant leaving behind the short stories on 2008’s Fearless or 2010’s  Speak Now and relying more on snippets of vivid imagery and detail. (“Getaway Car,” a sparkling Antonoff production that sounds like an “Out of the Woods” retread, is a dramatic and enjoyable outlier.) She leans on characters, some old and some new: the unrepentant brat, the swooning dreamer, and the determined, seductive adult. The “Look What You Made Me Do” video was prescient in at least one respect: Reputation collects a half-dozen different aspects of Swift and lines them up in a row. You leave the album with a new appreciation for her versatility, for the way the tough-talking schemer of “I Did Something Bad” and the infatuated android of “King of My Heart” can share the same tracklist. The woman who built a career on family-friendly romances like “Love Story” and “Mine” now turns her gaze to the darker side of passion: obsession, jealousy, lust, the loss of control. A lover turns her bed “into a sacred oasis” on the featherlight “Dancing With Our Hands Tied,” and she begs her partner to carve their name into her bedpost on “Dress,” a panting, shuddering highlight. Swift hasn’t played the romantic naïf since Red, and she delivers all of these lines with palpable confidence and ease. Even lesser material benefits: “So It Goes...” is replacement-level trap-pop, but it’s hard to shake the thought of her smeared lipstick, of fingernails dug into someone’s back. In any case, these songs are more successful than the tracks that invite the listener to revisit Swift’s public spats. “Look What You Made Me Do” is the album’s nadir, and “I Did Something Bad” violates what you could call Katy’s Law: the mention of “receipts” in your quasi-diss track renders it an embarrassment. Things somehow get less subtle: “Here’s a toast to my reeeeeal friends,” she sneers on “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” just before faking a weepy apology and breaking into cackling laughter. She’s shooting for over-the-top, campy villainy, but it scans as stubborn petulance. Every listener is over this. Reputation isn’t the failure that seemed possible a month or two ago; it’s full of bulletproof hooks and sticky turns of phrase. But in committing to a more conventional form of superstardom, Swift has deemphasized the skill at the core of her genius. The album ends with “New Year’s Day,” a spare, acoustic epilogue for an album made using a lot of synths and computers. It’s equal parts Lisa Loeb and Dashboard Confessional, and she conjures rich scenes with just a handful of lines: a hotel lobby strewn with party detritus, the silent back seat of a cab. She lands the album’s first true knockout punch in the bridge: “Please don’t ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere.” It’s a tiny universe in a dozen words, an economic marvel right up there with old classics like “You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter,” and, “You call me up again just to break me like a promise/So casually cruel in the name of being honest.” This song is Swift at her best—not settling scores long past their expiration date but writing the kind of lines reputations are made of.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-reputation/,Big Machine,2017.0
43,Isaac Hayes,The Spirit of Memphis (1962-1976),Pop/R&B,8.6,September 25 2017,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"In the late 1960s Isaac Hayes helped save Stax Records. After its considerable success earlier in the decade, the Memphis record label hit hard times that almost destroyed its modest empire. In December 1967 Otis Redding—the label’s biggest act and one of the most popular R&B singers in the world—was killed in a plane crash alongside most of the Bar-Kays. In April 1968 Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel, converting what had been a hideout and meeting place for the house musicians into a symbol of the nation’s escalating racial tensions. Meanwhile, Stax’s owners had been renegotiating the label’s contract with Atlantic Records, which had distributed nearly every Stax release; they were horrified to discover a clause that gave ownership of the entire back catalog, along with control of its second biggest act, Sam & Dave, to Atlantic. Stax had no funds and no way to get funds. One of the biggest success stories of the decade looked like it might meet an ignominious end—just another indie gobbled up by the New York giants strengthening their grasp on the market. Instead, Al Bell—Stax’s African-American president and co-owner—concocted an ambitious plan. He would create “an instant catalog by releasing nearly 30 albums and singles simultaneously,” writes Robert Gordon in the liner notes to the electrifying Isaac Hayes box set The Spirit of Memphis (1962-1976). Among them were records by Booker T. & the MGs, Eddie Floyd, and Rufus Thomas as well as Hot Buttered Soul, the curious second solo album by Stax pianist, songwriter, arranger, producer, and now singer Isaac Hayes. He had come to the company as a keyboard player in Floyd Newman’s band, eventually teaming up with a local kid named David Porter to write some of the biggest soul hits of the decade, including “B-A-B-Y” for Carla Thomas and “Hold On I’m Coming” and “When Something Is Wrong With My Baby” for Sam & Dave. He’d already recorded a solo album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, which had gone nowhere, but the label gave him full artistic control for a follow-up. Hot Buttered Soul is an odd record, but at the time it must have sounded almost aggressively unmarketable: four songs spread over two sides, only one of which was credited to Hayes himself. Side one opens with a 12-minute psych-soul cover of Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s “Walk On By,” and side two closes with an epic cover of Jimmy Webb’s “By the Time I Get to Phoenix” prefaced with several minutes of Hayes just talking. It sounded like nothing Stax had ever released, and under normal circumstances it might not have even been released. But Stax was desperate for product—any product—that might keep the company alive. Hot Buttered Soul marked a turning point for Stax, for Hayes, and for American popular music. Selling more than one million copies, it dominated the pop, jazz, R&B, and easy listening charts for more than a year. It also established Hayes as one of the biggest artists of the era: an exemplar of black sophistication and masculinity, a figure who rejected the fashions of the decade as too staid but embraced the pop songs of the ’60s as the scaffolding for his R&B experiments. Hayes was an outsize figure: bald yet bearded, his muscular frame accentuated by tight pants and chainmail vests. When he accepted his Oscar for “Theme from Shaft,” he stood at the podium in a blue tuxedo with a fuzzy collar and oversize bowtie. His musical and sartorial flamboyance has at times overshadowed his legacy in the decades following his heyday. To subsequent generations he is a punchline (“They say that Shaft is a bad motherf—” “Shut yo mouth!”) or perhaps a trendy sample source (particularly for 1990s trip-hop). Others may know him as Chef from “South Park”  or simply as another name on a long list of celebrity Scientologists. Even more than the recent reissues of Hayes’ records, The Spirit of Memphis presents him as an endlessly complex and compelling artist, one who mixed genres freely and viewed soul music as a vehicle for mind-bogglingly ambitious gambits. Hayes spent the first years of his career learning the rules of pop songcraft, then spent the rest of his life exploding them. That trajectory lends The Spirit of Memphis a unique narrative thrust that distinguishes it from so many single-artist box sets. It opens with a disc of songs predating his solo career, when he was playing in the house band, producing records, and writing songs for nearly every Stax artist. Porter was the lyric guy, while Hayes wrote the arrangements. Because he had no formal musical training and could not read or write music, he talked the musicians through their individual parts and directed the band while recording. The grooves on Floyd Newman’s “Sassy” and Booker T. & the MGs’ “Boot-Leg” have lost none of their elasticity over the last half-century, and “I’ll Run Your Hurt Away” shows how sensitive Hayes was with singers; rather than try to compete with Ruby Johnson’s sublime vocals, the piano and horns provide a sympathetic hand on her shoulder, underscoring every growl and whisper. Hayes’ velvety baritone may be his most recognizable instrument, but it doesn’t show up until three songs into the second disc, which collects his singles for Stax subsidiaries Volt and Enterprise. Even then, he mostly moans and beatboxes his way through “Precious, Precious,” off Presenting Isaac Hayes. According to the liner notes, the album was recorded while Hayes and the MGs were drunk on celebratory champagne, which lends the songs their slightly askew sensibility. The second disc portrays him as an artist with an ear for luxuriant and witty arrangements. The Bacharach-David hit “The Look of Love” becomes a crushed-velvet boudoir jam, somehow both macho and gentle. “Theme from Shaft” builds itself from the ground up, starting with a hi-hat rhythm and adding wakka-chikka guitar, bass, strings, and flute. Each instrument subtly ratchets up the tension and colors in the cinematic universe of Gordon Parks’ blaxploitation film. If the organizing principle falls apart on the third disc, that’s fine, because the music attains its own force, its own momentum. In addition to more covers—including songs byAl Green, Jerry Butler, the Moonglows, and of course Bacharach-David—there’s a short live set that was recorded in Chicago but sounds like Vegas. Perhaps even more enticing is a handful of studio jams on the fourth disc, including a rambling deconstruction of Bill Withers’ “Ain’t No Sunshine” and the notorious half-hour detonation of “Do Your Thing.” That song, which appears on the Shaft soundtrack in an extremely abbreviated version, shape-shifts almost constantly, mutating from an R&B stomp into a film score into a psych-rock exploration into something like a free-jazz foray. Hayes and his band stretch the song until it snaps, then keep on playing for another twenty minutes to see what lies beyond the melody and lyrics. The Spirit of Memphis stops in 1976, the year after Stax declared bankruptcy and Hayes signed with Polydor amid accusations that Stax had withheld royalties. He never hit the same heights again (although 1995’s Branded is a fine late-career peak), but he did remain a constant presence in pop culture until his death in 2008. Living up to its title, “Do Your Thing” is a fitting climax for The Spirit of Memphis, as it reveals Hayes to be a an artist who saw soul as a world-devouring music: one that could not only speak to African American desires and aspirations, but could swallow up any other sound and be molded into any shape he could dream up.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/isaac-hayes-the-spirit-of-memphis-1962-1976/,"Stax,Craft",2017.0
44,The Rolling Stones,Their Satanic Majesties Request,Rock,7.8,September 23 2017,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,"Did the Rolling Stones intend Their Satanic Majesties Request to be a spoof of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band or was it a sincere attempt to siphon some of the magic of the Beatles’ masterpiece? This question has hung over Satanic Majesties ever since its release in late 1967, perhaps due to the persistence of the perception that the two groups are locked in a deathless rivalry, or maybe just because their album artwork is so similar—not entirely surprising, considering how both ornate cover images are based on photographs snapped by Michael Cooper. Certainly, the arrival of a 50th Anniversary super deluxe reissue of Their Satanic Majesties Request just a few months after the lavish 50th Anniversary super deluxe reissue of Sgt. Pepper’s invites such comparisons and, once again, the Stones wind up with the raw end of the deal. The Beatles plumped up Pepper with session tapes, alternate mixes, and other ephemera that not only made diehard fans salivate, but provided fresh insights to an album whose story seemingly had been exhausted. In contrast, ABKCO slaps CDs and LPs of the stereo and mono mixes into a slim LP-sized fold-out box but never bothering with anything laying in the vaults, even though annotator Rob Bowman mentions two separate unreleased versions of “Sing This All Together (See What Happens)” in his liner notes. Such offerings may seem skimpy but blame ABKCO, not the Stones, who have no say in how their ’60s material is disseminated and reissued. Cast aside any comparisons to the Beatles, though, and consider Their Satanic Majesties Request on its own terms. Sure, Keith Richards claims in his 2010 memoir Life that “none of us wanted to make [Satanic Majesties], but it was time for another Stones album, and Sgt. Pepper’s was coming out, so we thought basically we were doing a put-on,” but that’s part of a rich tradition of the Rolling Stones dismissing their second album of 1967 that stretches all the way back to 1968, when Mick Jagger said it took them a year to finish the album because they were so “strung out.” While it is true that 1967 ranks among the worst years in Rolling Stones history—it opened with Jagger and Richards getting busted for dope, Brian Jones faced similar charges not much later, and interpersonal tensions were heightened by Keith swiping Anita Pallenberg away from Jones—the Satanic Majesties sessions didn’t last an abnormally long time. A few tracks were cut in February but they began in earnest in the late summer, after all the court cases were settled...a situation that presumably kept the Stones busy enough to not pay too much attention to the June release of Sgt. Pepper’s. Amid the personal turmoil of 1967, the Rolling Stones also faced a fracture in their inner circles, as Richards and especially Jagger became disenchanted by their manager and producer Andrew “Loog” Oldham. Immediate Records, the label Oldham launched in 1965, gained momentum thanks to the success of the Small Faces, but a bigger distraction for Loog was his increasing fondness for various intoxicants. Hunkering down in the studio in the aftermath of the Summer of Love, the Stones were riding on the same vibes that flowed from coast to coast in 1967, but they—or at least Jagger—were also determined to sever ties with Oldham. Jagger later claimed the Stones went wild on Satanic Majesties “to piss Andrew off, because he was such a pain in the neck. Because he didn’t understand it. The more we wanted to unload him, we decided to go on this path to alienate him.” But, as always, there may have been a mercenary mission driving Mick’s emotions. According to Fred Goodman’s biography Allen Klein: The Man Who Bailed Out the Beatles, Made the Stones, and Transformed Rock & Roll, “Oldham, who was contractually obligated to pay all recording costs, suspected the band members were out to bankrupt him and force his resignation. “Suddenly they weren’t arriving in the studio with songs. There’s actually nothing to do. Three weeks this is going on—and three weeks in the sixties was a very long time. I was bored and had no idea what I was doing there.’” According to Klein, the man who muscled aside Oldham in the management of the Stones, the faltering sessions was indeed intentional: “’What bothered Jagger was that Oldham was making five times as much as him.” All of this means that Their Satanic Majesties Request is the product of a bizarre set of personal, professional, and cultural circumstances, each pushing the Stones to make a record that’s its own strange, wonderful entity, one that is an anomaly within the Stones’ catalog but not one without precedent. Certainly, its immediate predecessor Between the Buttons—in both its U.S. and UK incarnations—has elements that resurface on Satanic Majesties, especially an insouciant rhythm and calculated indifference, the first flowerings of the signature Jagger trend of floating just above whatever cultural trend he co-opts. The Stones don’t seem quite as assured here as they did on Between the Buttons or Beggars Banquet, the 1968 sequel that cemented the band’s reputation as heirs to an American tradition that never was theirs by birthright. Satanic Majesties, on the other hand, burrows into British music from music hall (witness the pure camp of the closer “On With the Show” or the stately “She’s a Rainbow,” purple in its prose and procession) to pastoral folk (the hesitant hum of “Gomper”). What’s fascinating about Their Satanic Majesties Request is how it belongs to neither the precious school of English psychedelia or its rootsy American counterpart. Nobody on the American west coast really rocked hard in 1967—down in L.A., Love puffed themselves up with orchestras, up in San Francisco they were loathe to shake their folk roots—and the British psych acts of ’67 relied on trippy textures, eschewing any suggestion of swing. Keith Richards may later have claimed he couldn’t play his “old shit” on these sessions—and that was just four years later, in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1971—but Their Satanic Majesties has a pulse that no other psychedelic album does. Blame it on Charlie Watts if you want, but every song on Majesties has some air in its rhythm, which means it grooves when other psych records rely on texture. Unlike whatever private press psych set you may unearth, this is a band that actually mastered their instruments, so the music is kinetic even when it’s aimless. The group enjoys pushing the boundaries of what they can achieve in the studio and what they can do as a unit, so they indulge in making sounds  without the constructs of a song. Since the Stones usually adhere to a rigid structure, hearing them play without a net is thrilling, especially because they purposefully wandered without direction, then cut up a collage of the best elements some time later. This doesn’t mean Satanic Majesties is without songs—”She’s a Rainbow,” “2000 Man,” “Citadel,” “2000 Light Years From Home” are as clearly defined as any of their ’60s singles—but the endless, gormless “Sing This All Together (See What Happens)” and “Gomper” are supporting evidence for Oldham’s thesis that the band was attempting to run out the clock on his dime. They’re also strange and wonderful, pointing toward where the Stones would land, particularly “Sing This All Together (See What Happens),” which descends into a dry run for Keith’s five-string riffing. It’s a hint of a future to come that finds counterparts in the open string drones of “2000 Man” and the piercing echoes of “Citadel,” which contain bracing modern elements that overwhelm the period accoutrements of the production. Nevertheless, the charm of *Their Satanic Majesties Request * is that it is an artifact of its time, especially in how it’s emblematic of the excesses of its era but sounds like nothing else of its year, either. Perhaps psychedelia wasn’t a natural fit for the earthbound Stones, but the dissonance between their gritty rhythms and ornate, precocious arrangements is enthralling, not in the least because there’s no other record—by the Stones or anybody else—that sounds quite like this. And that means, with all its bad ideas, absurdity and wonder, Their Satanic Majesties Request may capture the ideals of the psychedelic 1967 better than Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, as it holds dear to the idea that there’s an entire world existing within your head.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-rolling-stones-their-satanic-majesties-request/,ABKCO,1967.0
45,The Killers,Wonderful Wonderful,Rock,6.3,September 22 2017,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"“I feel like I write a lot of solid 6s and 7s,” Brandon Flowers remarked recently. The lead singer of the Las Vegas rock band the Killers is not normally a paragon of humility and perspective, which only makes the accuracy of this recent offhand comment pierce deeper: He’s right. Despite more than a decade of striving, the Killers are inescapably a slightly above-average rock band. The numbers, pitiless as they are, pile against them: Even their Greatest Hits album from 2013 only had five great songs and thirteen other ones. And yet, they’ve brushed greatness. It might have been an eon ago, but they still wrote “Mr. Brightside” and “All These Things That I’ve Done” and “When You Were Young.” These songs soar over their heads like diamond-encrusted jets at their shows to U2-sized crowds who treat the band like demigods, at least for three or so minutes. With successes like this to haunt you, wouldn’t you spend the rest of your life doubling down on a losing hand too? They don’t hit their lucky number on Wonderful Wonderful, their fifth studio album. No tens here—sixes and sevens abound, for sure, a few fives, maybe an eight. Even mired among the sixes, though, you can feel the palpable yearning: Every Killers song believes its destiny is to be the festival closer, and that feeling is almost as convincing, on first blush, as encountering a song that actually fits the bill. “Don’t give up on me,” Flowers pleads on their new album, on a song called “Rut.” This is how much Flowers believes in his mission: He will attempt to wring a transcendent anthem from his inability to write them. If there’s one thing Flowers and his band have internalized about the nature of their greatness, it’s that it requires proximity to ridiculousness. Thus, they start with “ridiculous” and hope that rest takes care of itself somehow, which explains why the first sound on Wonderful Wonderful appears to be a synthesized Ewok horn. The song it announces, the title track, is built on thundering toms and a rumbling octave bassline echoing into the big sky. The stage is appropriately set for an Achtung Baby moment, but Flowers decides, instead of a big chorus, to bleat, “Motherless child, dost thou believe/That thine afflictions have caused us to grieve?” veering right past Achtung Baby U2 straight into “stuck inside a giant malfunctioning mechanical lemon” U2. Flowers picks himself up and dusts himself, undaunted, for the creamy-smooth falsetto harmonies and Jazzercise pump of “The Man.” The song, like other recent Killers songs, feels ersatz, a gift shop replica of a Vegas recreation of a Daft Punk cover of a Robert Palmer song. But it’s the most fun to be had on Wonderful Wonderful, complete with the sprained-ankle misstep-strut lyric “USDA certified lean,” delivered in that tremulous choirboy tenor of his. It feels, maybe, like a hit, and it’s one of the only moments on Wonderful Wonderful where Flowers bottles his particular brand of fizz before it goes flat. As always, Flowers brings several gasp-worthy slogans even when he can’t muster classic songs. He has come to understand, deeply, the character he plays in his band and he excels at the sort of winking writing that never spoils the show. On the ballad “Life to Come,” Flowers instructs us to “Drop-kick the shame.” On “Wonderful Wonderful,” he implores us to “Clothesline the shame.” O shame, it bedevils and shrivels us all! By the time he tenderly sings “You got the faith of a child before the world gets in” on “Some Kind of Love,” it feels like the most exalted compliment you could give to someone in Flowers World, and it is only right that he follows this endearment closely with “You got the soul of a truck.” If his heart wasn’t gold, if his ear wasn’t tin, it wouldn’t be the Killers. There are a couple of unintentionally sad moments on Wonderful Wonderful, moments where the props start to sag, the illusion of grandiosity threatened. On “Out of My Mind,” he announces his plan to “storm the gates of Graceland, to make you realize/I’m back to back with Springsteen,” before adding “You turned and rolled your eyes.” The moment feels uncomfortably like Flowers’ archnemesis, Shame, advancing on enemy territory. This is not why we have the Killers. You don’t go see Rambo to absorb the sobering realities of the military-industrial complex, and you don’t listen to the Killers to feel the sadness and hollowness underlying rock’n’roll dreams. You listen to the Killers for a cleansing blast of unwavering self-belief, to blur the line between oblivion and oblivious. There are other troubling signs in the eternal bull market of Flowers’ imagination. The band may or may not be breaking apart, member by member. To witness the end of the Killers would be heartbreaking, like watching a foreclosure sign go up on the Magic Kingdom. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so let me break the fourth wall here, Brandon; just you and me here now. As somebody else once said somewhere, don’t stop believing. Please don’t let anything—departing members, declining sales, creeping real world irrelevance, even this middling review—deter you. If you can hold on, you gotta help us out.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-killers-wonderful-wonderful/,Island,2017.0
46,"Tyler, the Creator",Flower Boy,Rap,8.5,July 21 2017,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"Tyler, the Creator’s music has often been defined by exclusion. He was furious when rap blogs refused to post Odd Future songs. He has gleefully responded to being banned from countries. His songs attempted to reconcile with a divided fanbase. The subtext of Odd Future was that pearl-clutching moralists simply weren’t in on the (obscene) joke—the whole point of being radicals is to be “apart from.” He has also done his fair share of exclusion, too: marginalizing and upsetting women and queer people with violently misogynistic and homophobic lyrics. It has been asked how to reconcile the genius with the foul-mouthed punk. Flower Boy (promoted as Scum Fuck Flower Boy) is Tyler’s course-correction, surprisingly meditative and beautifully colored, a collage of memories and daydreams that trades bratty subversion for reflection and self-improvement. He probes the things that shaped his psyche—loneliness, isolation, and disorientation—and focuses on outgrowing friendships, balancing the pull of nostalgia and the necessity for growth. Not only is Flower Boy Tyler’s most trenchant work, it’s his most inclusive: “Find Your Wings”: The Album, gentle and liberating. “Tell these black kids they can be who they are,” he raps on “Where This Flower Blooms,” as he grows into the artist he’s always longed to be, and perhaps always was. While trying to recreate an N.E.R.D. album, Cherry Bomb more or less imploded. But it didn't completely shed Tyler’s old skin, enlisting a host of colorful collaborators (Roy Ayers, Leon Ware, Charlie Wilson, Chaz Bundick, and Dâm-Funk) for songs about jerking off and underage relationships. His raps were regularly empty games of juvenile one-upmanship, snooty hand-wringing aimed at homebodies and the working class, and vitriolic rant raps aimed at no one in particular. There were love songs, but they were immature and sometimes flat-out creepy. Time had rendered his shock raps pretty toothless, and it was all sloppy. Conversely, Flower Boy is transformational, lovestruck and penetrating. Finally, Tyler gets to the essence of ideas he’s been chiseling at all along: the angst of a missed connection, the pain of unrequited love, navigating youthful ennui. These are hopeful and sincere songs about finding yourself and trying to find someone who values you completely. Tyler spends much of Flower Boy chasing his “‘95 Leo,” coming out in the process. On “Foreword,” he raps, “Shoutout to the girls that I lead on/For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm/And trying they hardest to keep my head on straight/And keeping me up enough till I had thought I was airborne.” He later writes, “Next line will have ‘em like ‘Whoa’: I’ve been kissing white boys since 2004.” The album’s literal and figurative centerpiece is “Garden Shed,” an inward-looking sexual awakening turning an extended metaphor into a watershed moment. Flower Boy unfurls from this revelation and the subsequent romance. He pens songs for his lover (“See You Again”), leaves him voicemails (“Glitter”), and seeks comfort through contact. Much will be (and has already been) made of what exactly this means for a rapper who once responded to an open letter from Sara Quin criticizing his homophobic words and actions and those who support them by crudely saying, “If Tegan And Sara Need Some Hard Dick, Hit Me Up!” Pivotal moments in his catalog are largely dependent on his often shameless and unapologetic use of gay slurs, and while these admissions don’t absolve him of past hate speech, they do paint a portrait of a confused and tactless young introvert in crisis. However listeners choose to interpret this conflict, Tyler doesn’t seem to be rapping to make amends but to be understood. This is not an apology or even an explanation. Flower Boy gingerly disentangles a knot of personal and complicated thoughts and feelings through the lens of flashbacks and love songs. So subdued, wistful, permissive, and relatable, are these songs—they are Tyler’s most refined to date. Collectively, they’re a kaleidoscopic sonic wonder. Though still obviously taking influence from the Neptunes, his production remains unlike anything else right now—glowing oddball orchestrations with unpredictable chord progressions, adorned by choruses of sweet voices. “Garden Shed” and “Glitter” are among his prettiest creations. He cedes “Droppin’ Seeds” to an in-form Lil Wayne, content to show off his peculiar ear for sound. “Enjoy Right Now, Today” takes it a step further, going lyric-free, accented by light Pharrell vocals. The title and the warm soul interior seem to usher the listener outside. For those chasing a Bastard-esque, punchy rap fix, there’s “Who Dat Boy” and “Pothole.” In the past, Tyler’s albums have been bloated and messy. Flower Boy is 17-minutes shorter than the average Tyler album with more understated transitions and less disorder and chaos. He has been known to overthink things or get too cute with compositions, tagging on eight-minute posse cuts, piecing together mismatched songs, adding attachments and embellishments where they aren’t needed. These songs here carry in them his tinkerer’s spirit without becoming overwrought. His ambition is a driving force in his work, but he curtails it for a more enjoyable and streamlined listen. The standouts, “911 / Mr. Lonely” and “I Ain’t Got Time!,” are carefully assembled arrangements made of gorgeous parts that fasten together seamlessly. There are several neat aesthetic choices, like playing “See You Again” as a radio request or pitching the halves of “Glitter” at opposing frequencies. There’s the juxtaposition of “Boredom” with “I Ain’t Got Time!”—a song about finding time with one about not having enough—then ending the latter abruptly to take a phone call. Where previous outings were tangled, Tyler’s adds a new elegance to his work. Though it’s probably an overstatement to call Flower Boy penitent, the album is certainly aware of past wrongs, and Tyler pursues integration through confession. Onlookers have wondered aloud when Tyler would “grow up,” and while “mature” still feels imprecise when describing the rapper-producer, there is certainly an evolution taking place. But this isn’t about the strides taken to make sense of a complicated past; Flower Boy shows thoughtfulness can be freeing. As Tyler, the Creator embarks on a journey of self-discovery, he becomes close to whole.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tyler-the-creator-flower-boy/,Columbia,2017.0
47,Guns N' Roses,Appetite for Destruction,Rock,10.0,July 16 2017,Maura Johnston,Contributor,"The video for “Welcome to the Jungle,” Appetite for Destruction’s mission statement, mirrors the journey that an unsuspecting listener might take during their first spin through Guns N’ Roses’ 1987 debut. A fresh-faced, 25-year-old Axl Rose, so country that he’s got a long stalk of wheat between his teeth, gets off a bus and enters a landscape that screams “bad side of town”; neon lights flash darkly, a shady guy perched on the corner approaches him, black-stockinged legs catch Axl’s eye. Cut to a similarly dank club where, with the aid of Aqua Net, Axl and the rest of Guns N’ Roses are barreling through the track, while TVs flicker into A Clockwork Orange-style fantasia about the bad news lurking all around. The electric opening notes, played with sputtering enthusiasm by lead guitarist Slash, only hint at the terror that’s coming; Axl’s under-his-breath “Oh my god” cranks up the tension; and then, aided by Steven Adler’s lightly swinging drums and backing vocals that recall a demon choir, the full horror is exposed—a world where every vice is for sale depending on your mood for indulgence and your tolerance for sin. The chugging breakdown, which culminates in Axl’s shrieked “You know where you are? You’re in the jungle, baby! You’re gonna diiiieeeeeaagghghhhhhghghghgh,” is “Tubular Bells” through a Marshall stack, a horror movie in miniature for anyone who thought the rock’n’roll lifestyle was all fun and games. Amid the bumper crop of records from ’80s bands who graduated from Sunset Strip clubs to MTV’s newly minted  “Headbangers Ball”—the self-titled debuts from glam brats Faster Pussycat and biker-bloozers L.A. Guns—Appetite stood out for how absolutely harsh it got, its chronicles of the wild life in Los Angeles plainly stated by the lye-voiced Axl while his bandmates bobbed and thrashed. The Los Angeles portrayed on Appetite inverts the ideal of Randy Newman’s ever-lovable metropolis, turning it into a place where the then-in-vogue term “drug war” meant fighting with the spectre of heroin (aka “Mr. Brownstone”), where trickle-down economics meant buying cheap hooch on the last scraps of credit, and where paranoid fantasies were always justified. Women were beautiful and you could even put the ones with less utility in their place every so often. It was the jungle, baby, and you were gonna die. Appetite for Destruction didn’t only stand out because of its storm of bad vibes, although that sure helped. The band’s stew of influences—caustic punk, sinewy funk, Aerosmith, the Stones—helped make it a switchblade-sharp statement of intent. “In the last year, I’ve spent over $1,300 on cassettes, everything from Slayer to Wham! to listen to production, vocals, melodies, this and that,” Axl told the UK music magazine Sounds in 1987, and while Mike Clink’s economical production doesn’t have the gloss of Wham!’s Make It Big, studying influences beyond the glammed-up bills at the Troubadour  played a large part in the band’s sound. From the their grimy photo shoots that became Metal Edge pinups to their candid discussions of how they survived before hitting it big (“Strippers were our main source of income. They’d pay for booze, sometimes you could eat...” Slash told Rolling Stone), Guns N’ Roses were often portrayed as a clouded mass of debauchery with insatiable needs to simultaneously consume and destroy. “We are just being ourselves, but at the same time, these ’bad boy’ images tend to sell,” Axl told SPIN in 1988. Slash told Melody Maker something similar that same year: “We’re not mean, we’re not nasty, we’re decent people. We’re just out for a good time, like five teenagers on the loose.” The Parents Music Resource Center panic that took hold in the mid-’80s helped fuel GNR’s reputation as “bad boys.” The band were open about their vices on record and in interviews, but their wide-ranging appeal, despite the cluck-clucking of reactionary critics, wasn’t merely the result of them wearing their indulgences on their sleeves. They had shrewd ears and wide-ranging influences, resulting in a sound that used bouncing-ball grooves with punk’s economy that vibrated with paranoia and antipathy yet could (very occasionally) settle into romantic bliss. Bassist Duff McKagan came from the Seattle punk scene, drumming for the legendary hyper-power-poppers Fastbacks; he and drummer Steven Adler would hone their rhythm-section camaraderie by listening to Cameo and Prince LPs. Slash, the London-born son of a costumer who designed for Bowie, decided to pick up the guitar when he heard Aerosmith’s 1975 opus Rocks, telling Guitar World that the album’s “drunken, chemically induced powerhouse sound just sold me and changed me forever.” Izzy Stradlin, the band’s chief songwriter who’d escaped Indiana with Axl, had a Charlie Watts air about him, being the coolest guy in the room while he laid down riffs from which Slash’s solos could take flight. “Welcome to the Jungle,” the album’s opener, is followed by “It’s So Easy”—one of the greatest one-two punches in rock history. A snarling chronicle of the void at the center of any Dionysian orgy, it’s powered by Adler’s butterfly-bee drumming and riffs that sound like they’ve been turned into pistons. The lessons in funk taken by Adler and McKagan make the album’s most harrowing moments roll out of the speakers all throughout—the shimmying that underlies the rancid takedown of a cleaned-up bad girl on “My Michelle,” the musical portrayal of the “West Coast struttin’” by the blotto protagonist of “Nightrain.” Axl’s scorched-earth upper register is at key times doubled not just by his bandmates, but by a low-pitched version of his own voice—detailing that adds another edge to the group’s dystopian reveries. Even with Appetite’s thick layers of grime, its path to mainstream success was shoved along by songs that reflected a bit of Southern California sunshine. “Sweet Child O’Mine” was the album’s big hit, a mushy love song set aloft by Slash’s thick arpeggiating (which, as he told Rolling Stone, was a “goofy personal exercise” overheard by Axl, who decided to write lyrics to it ) and Axl’s doe-eyed lyrics. It’s not all light-hearted—his initially muttered, eventually yelped, “Where do we go? Where do we go now?” that peppers the bridge reveals his ever-present search for more as the song resolves in a minor key. The album’s most triumphant moment is the Jock-Jam-in-waiting “Paradise City,” a fever-dream anthem where green grass and lovely women abound, where everyone’s so cheerful that no one will give you shit if you add a synthesizer to the mix. The main riff is one of those so-simple-it’s-criminal melodies that get arenas shaking; when it double-times at the song’s end, with Slash freaking out on a solo and Axl pleading to be taken haaaawwoooooommmmeeee, it’s an invitation to exhume the toxins of the mean streets and the meaner drugs and the even meaner people and to just thrash away their residue. Like most CD-era albums, Appetite has its lesser tracks, but even songs that feel like filler have odd filigrees that set them apart from their peers’ padding. “Anything Goes,” in which a horned-up Axl gets ready to get freaky, opens with Slash laying down an abstract psych-jazz solo and closes with a thrashing rework of the song’s central riff; “Think About You” is a fairly boilerplate love song elevated by beaded-curtain counterpoint guitars on its winsome chorus. “You’re Crazy,” which would later get a stripped-down treatment on the band’s stopgap 1988 LP G N’ R Lies, is a ball of paranoia made even more frantic by the guitars lagging ever so slightly behind its manic pace. But “Rocket Queen,” the album’s closer, is a brilliant study in contrasts that still unnerves. It’s a mini-epic that hinted at the more sprawling aesthetic Axl and his bandmates would adopt on 1991’s Use Your Illusion diptych. (Those records contained the ruminative “November Rain” and the crystalline “Don’t Cry,” ones that the band had been workshopping since their earliest days as Hollywood Rose, and that were deemed inappropriate for Appetite.) It’s petulant, carnal, and romantic all at once. It famously incorporates a female orgasm recorded in their studio, with the woman’s cries and shudders folding into Slash’s guitar pyrotechnics, leaping into a yelp alongside the guitar. Its first half chugs and seethes while Axl goes over his bad side in detail—he’s seen it all, dined at elaborate buffets and came away still hungry, schooled himself in the art of manipulation. He is, in short, a bad dude…until he’s redeemed by the song’s second half, all windswept balladry that allows Axl to engage in a little street-corner whoa-oh-oh-ing. “All I ever wanted…was for you to know that I care,” he croons, an exclamation point proffered by the band in unison. It’s a surprising closing sentiment for an album so drenched in fear and loathing. But taken of a piece with the band members’ declarations that despite the hard living they were just five guys out to have a good time, it also shows how Guns N’ Roses’ early outlook was as animated not just by its members’ heady stew of influences. Perhaps all that wanton consumption could lead to a place of contentment that offered more than the comfort offered by the Midwest, more than the neon-lit debauchery of clubs’ back rooms—a wandering through the jungle that would open up into paradise.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/guns-n-roses-appetite-for-destruction/,Geffen,1987.0
48,Metallica,Metallica,Metal,7.7,July 9 2017,Zoe Camp,Contributor,"June 29, 1990: Deep in the guts of Toronto’s CNE Stadium, four shaggy, sweaty, booze-swilling horsemen of the apocalypse are hatching a cultural coup. James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Lars Ulrich, and Jason Newsted just opened up for Aerosmith, their childhood heroes. Judging by the muffled roars emanating from the arena, Steven Tyler’s got the world wrapped around his finger. The same will be said for Metallica within a year’s time. They won’t settle for anything less than a supervillain death grip. Granted, Metallica’s approach up to this point has proven hugely successful, a byzantine war machine powered by a spartan tactic Ulrich will later outline to critic David Masciotra as simply: “not fucking up.” Judging from their generous album sales, sold-out tours, Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental Grammy nomination, and hard-won laurels despite crickets from the establishment, “not fucking up” should ensure that their wallets remain as stuffed as the arenas. But these are the guys who gave us Kill ’Em All; they won’t stop until they’ve slayed Poison, Mötley Crüe, Ratt, and every last one of those platinum-blonde, spandex-wearing false heirs to the heavy metal throne with their own weapons: massive riffs, clean vocals, sharp arrangements, and layered mixes that gush from the speakers like knife wounds. They’ll even tap Bob Rock—the man behind Bon Jovi’s Slippery When Wet, an anti-Metallica album if there ever was one—to ensure the heist goes off without a hitch. Naturally, Metallica will name this declaration of war and independence after themselves. It’s the best-selling album of the past 25 years, with currently over 20 million copies sold worldwide, more than Bruce Springsteen’s Born In The U.S.A. or Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side Of The Moon. Even if you handed out three Black Albums to every citizen in Ulrich’s native Denmark, you’d be left with a warehouse full of CDs. Few bands have achieved such ubiquity so that if you know literally one thing about metal music, it is the six-note opening riff to “Enter Sandman.” Though Metallica were neither unknowns nor underdogs when they recorded their fifth studio album Metallica, the status quo as dictated by music critics, disc jockeys, and MTV framed them as such. Throughout the ’80s, Metallica and their Big Four peers—Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax—challenged metal’s emergent portrait of pomp by way of extreme fundamentalism. In her 1992 book Heavy Metal: A Cultural Sociology, Deena Weinstein compared thrash metal to the Protestant Reformation, framing it as a reaction to corruption: “Both movements [the Reformation and thrash metal],” she wrote, “charged that the established form had become corrupt through extravagance, and both supported a return to the essential message, stripped bare of all adornment.” Metallica’s rapid ascent throughout the latter half of the decade—from Golden State basement fiends, to Big Four figureheads, to Grammy nominees—shattered the cultural status quo. The group’s first studio three albums—1983’s Kill ’Em All, 1984’s Ride the Lightning, and 1986’s Master of Puppets—are a trio of bloodthirsty, whip-smart chimeras. Their din bears traces of blues, punk, hard rock, progressive jams, and—thanks to bassist Cliff Burton’s virtuosic strivings—even classical music. By identifying the genres’ cathartic common ground and amping up the drama, Metallica reframed the heavy metal revival as a serious movement, as opposed to a perennial retread. Burton’s tragic death in September 1986 intensified Metallica’s ambition. Shortly after Burton’s death, they’d recruited a new bassist, Flotsam and Jetsam frontman (and lifelong Metallica fan) Jason Newsted; and two years later, they released ...And Justice For All. Between its extensive runtimes, unusual time signatures, and arcane arrangements, it remains a fan-favorite whose genius is often overshadowed by the fact that it sounds like it was recorded through a tin can. Its ramshackle mixing kills the dynamic frisson: Hetfield and Hammett’s dueling riffs collapse into a static, mind-numbing roar; Ulrich’s fills hit like raindrops instead of the usual mortars; Newsted’s bass lines are nearly impossible to make out, positioned so far back in the mix that a group of fans took it upon themselves to release a bootleg, bass-boosted version of the album titled ...And Justice For Jason. Nevertheless, ...And Justice For All positioned Metallica within striking distance of the mainstream. The LP debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard Charts—a feat practically unheard of for a metal band at the time—and went platinum within nine weeks. It was their most successful crossover to date thanks to its music video for “One,” which got them on MTV. And yet, remarkably, the band looked back on their latest triumph with disappointment. As Metallica’s fanbase grew, more non-metalheads came into the fold. This influx of casual listeners created a communication gap, which was particularly evident in concert. Speaking with Masciotra, Ulrich identified the album’s associated “Damaged Justice” tour as the end of the honeymoon and, arguably, Metallica as most people knew it. “Early on the tour, we started wondering why the songs were so long, progressive, and all-over-the-place,” he said. “We felt that the material did not connect well live because it was too introverted and cerebral.” In Ulrich’s view, Metallica had taken the progressive side as far as they could. The only way for the band to move on was to look back, to invoke the bad-asses who’d inspired them, and so many others, to pick up guitars and drumsticks in the first place: barnstormers like Motörhead, Black Sabbath, the Rolling Stones, and so on. Also, the next album needed to not sound like shit. In a huge leap of faith, Metallica began their years-long relationship with Bob Rock—a straight-shooting, detail-oriented guitar band guru who’d manned the boards for Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and other arena mainstays—to take the reins on production. He accepted their offer after witnessing them live: “I had bought the Justice record, and I just didn’t get it,” he later told Masciotra of the album, which he described as thin. “Then when I saw them play live after the Cult, and they walked off stage, I thought, ‘That’s not the band on the Justice record.’” Far and wide, Rock’s production comprises Metallica’s greatest source of controversy. While it may be tempting to paint Rock as a sinister interloper, Adam Dubin’s behind-the-scenes documentary A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica positions him, instead, as a grizzled studio sherpa nudging the band away from clunky performances or technical mishaps, often to considerable pushback from his charges. “Lars, will you make the next couple versions a little more peppery off the top? A little more weight into it?” he says Ulrich at one point, like a parent asking his son to clean his room. Lars seethes, “If you want weight, I’m your fucking guy!” Elsewhere, he reminds Hetfield to sing and play at the same time, only to get another tantrum in response: “You wanna hear it with vocals? Go sing it.” The producer left a new mark on the group: he turned Hetfield from an untrained screamer to a seasoned rock singer, pushed the frontman to step up his lyrical game and brought Newsted out of the shadows, recasting him as the stoic yin to Ulrich’s frenzied yang. And then, of course, there’s his showstopping mix: the subject of countless late-night road-tests and in-studio arguments, and the long-awaited antidote to the muddled palettes of Metallica albums past. Nowhere is this more evident than in the intro to “Enter Sandman”: Hammett’s riff creeps in from the background, a night-stalker inching closer by the minute. Hetfield swoops in behind him, the violent churn intensifies and, upon Ulrich and Newsted’s entry, finally overflows in a froth: cacophonous, chilling, and definitively anthemic. Metallica’s twelve tracks may be sorted into three categories: angsty arena anthems, furrowed-brow ballads, and tamer, hybridized takes on Metallica’s famous pit-starters. Aside from “Holier Than Thou” and “Through the Never,” which offer red meat for the black-leathered fans of old, the album skews simplistic, melodically and lyrically. Whereas Ride the Lightning and ...And Justice for All prioritized instrumental stunts over melody, Metallica bets it all on Hetfield, a paradigm shift made all the more noticeable by his bandmates’ restraint. Instead of firing off fills, Ulrich keeps it simple, locked in 4/4 throughout (“It’s a little bit like building a house,” he crows in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica, chest puffed, shit-eating grin on his face, “If you have a good foundation, then…”) Newsted mostly swears by the root notes, but gives millions of would-be bassists their first homework assignment with “My Friend of Misery”’s percolating refrain. While he’s given plenty of room to show off his solos (”Don’t Tread on Me” and “Of Wolf and Man” are particularly fiendish), Hammett’s riffs skew tamer, more deliberate, and subservient to the Hetfield’s pained yowls. Hetfield pivots between devastating croons and razor-throated yells like a seasoned “American Idol” contestant. “I’m your dream/I’m your eyes/I’m your pain” he sneers on “Sad But True,” a song Rock labelled the heavy metal “Kashmir.” This technique inevitably draws the listener’s focus to Hetfield’s lyrics, which, while perfectly suited for stadium sing-a-longs, aren’t exactly Pulitzer material. You can see the low-hanging rhymes coming from a mile away—“real” and “feel,” “be” and “see,” “you” and “do.” More damningly, it saps his revealing personal narratives of their latent emotional heft. “The God That Failed” is a bittersweet ode to Hetfield’s mother, a Christian Scientist who succumbed to cancer because she refused to treat it through any means other than faith. And yet, for every devastating couplet (”The healing hand held back the deepened nail/Follow the God that failed”), there’s two chunks of clunky poetry not far behind (”Find your peace/Find your say/Find the smooth road on your way”; “Pride you took/Pride you feel/Pride that you felt when you’d kneel.”) The simplicity proves far more successful on “Nothing Else Matters,” an acoustic ballad which, however ham-fisted, stands as one of the album’s most revolutionary moments. Here, smack dab in the center of metal’s hyper-masculine universe, we have one of the genre’s most fearsome luminaries singing the praises not of Satan, sex, or the good sweet leaf, but rather a woman. Given the overarching cultural context, Hetfield’s insistence that he’s “Never cared for what they say/Never cared for games they play/Never cared for what they do/Never cared for what they know” scans as a middle finger to all the meatheads who think intimacy and metal are mutually exclusive. His solo acts as the band’s closing argument, undeniable proof that vulnerability could both rock and sell. August 12, 1991: At midnight, the coup officially begins. The metalheads don their old concert tees and rush, rapt and stoned, to their nearest record store, where they await Metallica’s fifth album coming in droves. The makers of A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica are on hand to chronicle one such release party, and ask the faithful for their thoughts on this monumental album, and what they think it all means. “Reality, man…some shit you just can’t change.” responds one particularly impassioned mullet-man, shouting over his equally-stoked friend. “Listening to the words, it talks about people who, I don’t know, either can’t forgive, or the people that die unforgiven by others,” a soft-spoken young woman posits, reverent, as if contemplating a Rothko. Just like Metallica’s lyrics, the band’s fans’ insights scan as invariably vague, slightly naive, and unflinchingly, impossibly earnest. It’s only appropriate that these remarks comprise A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica’s opening scene: They’re candids of the Black Album’s power as a tabula rasa for a young, embittered generation, saddled with their parents’ wars and religious scorn. When the hesher in the “Metal Up Your Ass” t-shirt proclaims, “My parents don’t think anything about Metallica, they just ignore it,” he’s really gesturing to a generational victory: Mom and Dad with their heads in the sand, while the kids raise hell and make history. Heavy metal had officially set up shop on the main stage. As if to prove their point, they hit the road in 1992 with Guns N’ Roses (the only band who rivaled their power at the time; their contemporaneously released albums Use Your Illusion I and II moved 14 million units altogether) for a massive, effects-heavy arena outing. During the band’s run-through of “Fade to Black” at the August 8 stop in Montreal, Hetfield lost track of the band’s complicated pyrotechnics setup and found himself standing atop an erupting grate, leaving the frontman with second- and third-degree burns and forcing his band to the sidelines for several days. The real burn, though, was still five years off. In May 1996, MTV screened Samuel Bayer’s surreal, melodramatic visual for “Until It Sleeps”—the moody, ur-Godsmack lead single from the Black Album’s successor Load, which removed thrash from the musical equation even further. Five seconds in, we spot Ulrich, dressed like one of the cock-rockers he loved to loathe: thick black eyeliner, shorn head, silver earrings. He drags his hands down his face, his lips curling in a cartoonish gesture of exasperation as if struggling to understand how he ended up in the get-up to begin with. Elsewhere on Load, Hetfield sings in a voice that would usher in the sound of post-grunge and butt rock for the next decade: “Careful what you wish you may regret it/Careful what you wish you just might get it.” The words drip with meaning now, knowing Metallica’s long road through the turn of the 21st century would be filled with charges of “hair cuts!” and “sell outs!” as well as their own much-derided suit against Napster. There was Newsted’s famous quip from their episode of VH1’s “Behind The Music:” “Yes, we sell out: every seat in the house, every time we play, anywhere we play,” spoken just a few years before he departed the band in early 2001; his acknowledgements of Metallica’s rise in the public sphere and identity crises embedded therein, however lighthearted, nonetheless presaged the physical and existential temper tantrums captured on 2004’s tell-all documentary Some Kind of Monster. Metallica, however, remains the final bastion of focus: a hubristic request for grace masquerading as a show of force, the prophetic turning point for the world’s biggest ever metal band.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/metallica-metallica/,Elektra,1991.0
49,Marvin Gaye,"Here, My Dear",Pop/R&B,8.7,July 2 2017,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"As a teenager in the 1950s, Marvin Gaye learned how to love from doo-wop songs, three-minute odes to innocence that didn’t curdle or grow up or live beyond their own pining harmonies. They were pure, and Gaye wanted to be pure too. “I was in love with the idea of love,” he once said. Which is sweet. But the fantasy of pop music should be just that—a fantasy. Believe it to the letter, and wait for your world to crumble. Vows break. Sadness sours. Divorce looms. Gaye was aware of these perils, but he spent much of his life haplessly wishing them away. His music always told a different story. Gaye married Anna Ruby Gordy in 1963. He was 24; she was 41. He was an aspiring singer; she was the sister of Berry Gordy, founder of Motown Records. Looking back on the relationship years later, Gaye described it to biographer David Ritz as a mercenary move. “Marrying a queen might not make me king, but at least I’d have a shot at being prince,” he said. “I wanted her to help me cut into that long line in front of the recording studio.” For a few years, though, Gaye was able to approximate the fairytale love he had always dreamed about. The couple adopted a baby boy. And Gaye’s bounding heart can be heard in his hits of the era like “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),” where he beams, “You were better to me than I’ve been to myself/For me there’s you and there’s nobody else.” But soon enough, infidelities arose. Fights erupted. Raised in a strict religious household, Gaye had trouble reconciling ideas of love and sex, and though this struggle would lead to some of his most fascinating songs, it also doomed him as a husband. Complicating matters further was his extreme Oedipus and “Madonna-whore” complexes. He lost his virginity to a prostitute and went on to pay for sex through much of his life (and marriages). Meanwhile, he considered his mother to be the absolute pinnacle of womanhood, to a detrimental degree. “No other woman ever looked as good to me as Mother,” he said. He often referred to Anna as “Mama” as well. So as his wife helped her self-destructive husband become a star with her connections and encouragement throughout the ’60s, she could never be his mythical savior. Nobody could. Gaye described his own conundrum in typically candid terms: “Without Anna, how could I reach my next plateau? With Anna, though, how could I ever be a happy man?” By the late ’60s, the couple was decidedly on the outs. Gaye was still part of Motown’s hit factory at that point and wasn’t writing his own songs, but he still offered performances that mirrored his emotions. He laced the skulking “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” with paranoia just as he and Anna were cheating on each other. He even recorded something of a breakup album, M.P.G., in 1969, filled with chugging songs that put love in past tense. But Gaye and Anna didn’t get divorced. Both were scared what would happen; Gaye was worried he would fall out of Berry Gordy’s good graces, while Anna, accustomed to the celebrity lifestyle, didn’t want to give up on her superstar husband. As the ’70s began, Gaye entered his auteur period, breaking out of the Motown mold with What’s Going On. In 1973, at age 33, he fell in love once more, with a 16-year-old named Janis Hunter. A year later, they had a baby together. Gaye and Anna were still married. Finally, in 1975, as Hunter became pregnant with another child, Anna filed for divorce. She had the right to be fed up, but the timing also made sense in the greater context of American marriage. In ’75, the number of divorces and annulments in the U.S. exceeded one million for the first time, more than doubling the tally from just a decade before. Reasons for the uptick were plentiful: evolving social mores, the declining role of religion, laws that simplified the process, and an overall sense of personal entitlement. In a previous generation, Gaye’s mother considered divorcing her husband, who never really loved Marvin and beat him relentlessly as a child, but she didn’t out of what she called “loyalty and responsibility.” But times had changed. “This is an era in which many Americans are far more concerned with their rights than with their responsibilities,” declared a 1976 New York Times article titled “Divorce Epidemic,” “and also a time when little premium is put upon patience or accommodation to less than ideal situations.” Though Anna was trying to move forward, Gaye dragged his feet. He was ordered to pay $6,000 a month in alimony and child support, but he refused, allegedly telling Anna: “I’m not going to obey any court order no matter what they try to do me. The only thing I am going to do is take off my hat when I enter the courtroom.” For all the sympathy and understanding of Marvin Gaye’s music, the man could be a boor. He once claimed to be “the last of the great chauvinists. I’ll never change. I like to see women serve me—and that’s that.” But no amount of ball swinging was going to settle his divorce. Gaye was terrible with money, often investing in bogus schemes and blowing untold sums on pot and coke, so when Anna asked for $1 million, he simply didn’t have the funds. So his lawyer proposed an interesting solution: Gaye would pay $600,000, half of which would come from the advance for his next album, with the other half coming from that album’s royalties. It was an insane idea. Of course Gaye agreed to it. Recorded in 1977, around the time Gaye’s divorce became final, the singer originally planned to produce something quick and mediocre, but the subject matter was too rich. The result was Here, My Dear, a 73-minute epic and the only double-LP he would ever make. Though birthed from contentious circumstances, the album still retains its power because it’s not just a heated diatribe, a peeved he-said to infinity. Unlike some of Gaye’s real-life actions, the album is nuanced, thoughtful, progressive. After a scene-setting intro—“I guess I’ll have to say this album is dedicated to you”—the story begins in earnest with, fittingly, a doo-wop song. “I Met a Little Girl” boasts all the longing and vocal stacking of Gaye’s beloved ’50s music, but with the perspective flipped—he’s singing not as a green teen but as a man in his late 30s who has tried and failed at love, and is no closer to figuring it out. Gaye exquisitely sings all of the parts himself, creating an echo chamber of hurt. Though the singer spoke out against the women’s liberation movement of the era, there’s a generousness to his voice and sentiments, and a shared blame. “Then time would change you,” he squeals, “as time would really change me.” The song is nearly zen in its wistfulness, with a sumptuous arrangement and languid pace. Later, on a track called “Anger,” Gaye still takes the longview, condemning the soul-destroying properties of rage rather than giving into them. Perhaps the slow crumble of Gaye’s marriage across more than a decade allowed him a certain distance, and a way to make this very personal album feel like much more than one man’s loss. Like much of Gaye’s ’70s work, Here, My Dear is a groove album. Voices, instruments, and hooks don’t jump out as much as they lay in the cut waiting to be discovered. Though it can sound redundant at first, its unvaried instrumentation and tempo strengthen the thematic bonds within. Three tracks called “When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You,” are worked into the suite, all with the same easy sax funk, as if Gaye keeps returning to the question in hopes of a definitive answer. Spacious jazz backgrounds make tracks like “Sparrow” and “Anna’s Song” luxuriate in memories and idylls gone by—even when Gaye breaks character by screaming “An-na!” the vamp barely breaks its stride, acting as something of a calming agent. Here, My Dear is not entirely civil. As in love and life, there is pettiness. “Is That Enough” aims at Anna’s spending habits, with Gaye somehow making divorce-court language sound effortlessly cool: “What could I do/The judge said she got to keep on living/The way she accustomed to.” Meanwhile, on “You Can Leave, But It’s Going to Cost You,” the singer claims that he was essentially held prisoner by Anna’s power and money for all those years, as he ventriloquizes his wife’s demands. “That young girl is going to cost you,” he sings, referring to his girlfriend Janis. “If you want happiness, you got to pay.” There’s a gorgeous hymn of forgiveness that could fit on What’s Going On, a strutting pep talk about getting your shit together, and “A Funky Space Reincarnation,” an out-of-place eight-minute misstep about space sex that has Gaye talking about people getting “plutotized” in a “plutotarium” on, um, Pluto. And yes, that was the single. But neither the song nor the album was a smash. Here, My Dear peaked at No. 26 on a Billboard chart stuffed with disco acts like Chic, Bee Gees, and Village People in early 1979. Anna, unsurprisingly, was not a fan of the project. In a JET interview at the time, she took the high road, saying, “The things he said, the way the lyrics relate constantly to our personal marital relations, are certainly a violation of many things that I held sacred.” Anna threatened to file a $5 million invasion-of-privacy suit but it never materialized; in 1987, three years after Gaye was shot and killed by his father, she accepted his award into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Eighteenth-century author Samuel Johnson famously said that second marriages are “the triumph of hope over experience.” Which might help explain why, after getting through a tortuous divorce and then recording an album about that divorce, Gaye married Janis Hunter in 1977, mere months after his split with Anna was official. But Gaye’s self-destructive habits had only deepened; by the time of Here, My Dear’s release, at the end of 1978, it was Hunter who was thinking about filing for divorce. “Once we got married, things only got worse,” Gaye said of his relationship with his second wife. “I saw that I’d trapped myself again, but I couldn’t help it.” With his warped expectations of love, it was impossible for Marvin Gaye to fully experience the happy family life he so desired. But there were flashes. One can be heard on “Falling in Love Again,” Here, My Dear’s final full song, where he sounds free and joyous in a moment of satisfaction with Hunter. “So love me, as though there was no tomorrow,” he pleads, trying to freeze a moment of bliss before it’s gone.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/marvin-gaye-here-my-dear/,Tamla,1978.0
50,The Beach Boys,1967 - Sunshine Tomorrow,Rock,8.1,July 1 2017,Jesse Jarnow,Contributor,"From early 1966 to early ’67, the Beach Boys matured from a platform for Brian Wilson’s songwriting and production into a fully democratic band. As Wilson and Los Angeles session musicians were laboring over Pet Sounds and the infamously scrapped Smile, a live quartet—led by Brian’s brother Carl—toured the world, with Bruce Johnston replacing the stage-shy Brian. But during the Summer of Love, as Wilson’s Smile lost focus, these two visions of the Beach Boys merged and created something new—as documented on the remarkable 2xCD set 1967 - Sunshine Tomorrow. These recordings make it possible to hear the Beach Boys simultaneously as the moody pop geniuses of Pet Sounds and the fresh-faced surf-rockin’ teens from Hawthorne, Calif.—and, for that matter, the unabashed nostalgia-mongers of their later years. Sunshine Tomorrow assembles the bulk of the Beach Boys’ post-Smile 1967 work. There are outtakes and demos from two albums, titled Smiley Smiley and Wild Honey, as well as pieces of a scrapped live record, a live studio session, and concert versions. The compilation is anchored up top by the first stereo mix of Wild Honey—a homemade, detuned, piano-based affair, where the band found a new voice for their ebullient early ’60s bounce. Clocking in at just over 20 minutes, Wild Honey is pure fun from the theremin burst opening of the title track to off-kilter folk-pop miniatures like “I’d Love Just Once to See You.” Though most of the tracks are credited to the songwriting team of Brian Wilson and Mike Love, Wild Honey’s key is “How She Boogalooed It,” an original R&B tune credited to every Beach Boy except Brian. The other four members, along with Brian’s tour replacement Johnston, were beginning to contribute to the Beach Boys in unprecedented ways. That was especially true of Carl, who was beginning to take over the producer’s role. For those already familiar with the sweet charms of Wild Honey, this new mix reveals details throughout, like the DIY Pet Sounds-style busyness of “Aren’t You Glad” and the bass-led “Let the Wind Blow.” But the set’s value comes in the outtakes, rehearsals, live recordings, and even fake live recordings, revealing a band that retained far more ambition than their two modest 1967 LPs suggested. Though often framed as the band’s discovery of R&B, Sunshine Tomorrow reveals Wild Honey to contain almost as many connections to brother Brian’s sad-boy masterpieces and psych-pop as it does to the surf-rockers of yore. Smiley Smile was recorded in June and July that year, when Beach Boys sessions moved predominantly from proper studios into Brian Wilson’s Bel Air home. Accordingly, Smiley Smile is the quirkier of the band’s two 1967 LPs, carrying forward the cosmic playfulness of Smile with the Boys’ earnestness swapped for Van Dyke Parks’ puzzle-box lyrics. In the studio, the band had been mostly subservient to Brian-the-Genius, and Smiley Smile reveals a finally-shifting dynamic. Working together on the exotica-tinged “Little Pad,” the Boys take up parts that would’ve once been played by the sessions musicians known as the Wrecking Crew, and it marks a beginning of their own individual creative developments. But Smiley Smile’s lead single, “Gettin’ Hungry”—included as a live take on Sunshine Tomorrow—was the first Beach Boys release not to chart since a 1962 7” issued under the name Kenny & the Cadets. And Smiley Smile itself didn’t do much better. “It just didn’t have anything to do with what was going on [in 1967]—and that was the idea,” Mike Love is quoted saying in Howie Edelson’s perceptive liner notes. Wild Honey, released in December, was only a slight improvement in sales. Heard now, it’s clearly a breakthrough. After the mega-success of “Good Vibrations,” the rock press had breathlessly covered the ongoing developments of Smile, elevating Wilson to intelligensia status—so much so that he’d been included on the planning committee for the June 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, with the Beach Boys scheduled for a headlining slot. But when the band pulled out of their performance, the ascendant underground effectively wrote the Beach Boys—one of the biggest American hitmakers of the decade—out of the ’60s rock narrative that followed. For that matter, the years following Smile are often written out of the Beach Boys’ own history. (In the 2014 Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy, Wilson follows up Smile by waking up in the 1980s as John Cusack.) But while Wilson drew inward and gradually stop participating in the late ’60s, he remained a vital member of the Beach Boys for several more years and albums. Sunshine Tomorrow documents one of the all-time paradoxes of rock history: the sound of a band taking a major creative turn at the exact moment pop culture dooms them to obsolescence. Sunshine Tomorrow also captures the final live performances of the original Beach Boys quintet with Brian (and without additional musicians) in Hawaii in August 1967. Intended as a live album and ultimately tossed aside, only 12 minutes make the cut here, including two rehearsal takes. Wilson’s vision of a smaller Beach Boys sound most definitely would not have passed the Monterey acid test against the likes of the Who and Jimi Hendrix, especially the muted surf toodles of the “Hawthorne Boulevard” set opener. But it’s a joy to hear the original Beach Boys do “Heroes and Villains” in all its barbershop weirdness, drummer Dennis Wilson translating Hal Blaine's cinematic thwack to an old-fashioned surfer's stomp. With the Hawaii concert tapes deemed unusable within days of the recording, the band reconvened a few weeks later at a Hollywood studio with auxiliary member Johnston to rerecord the songs, planning to add in crowd noise and release it as a “live” album. It, too, would disappear into the Beach Boys’ accumulating vault of unreleased music. While Sunshine Tomorrow omits Mike Love’s oft-cited anti-“Heroes and Villains” tirade from the Hollywood session, in which he refers to the single as a “nuclear disaster,” the band is powerful but subdued throughout. Brian sings “The Letter,” a brand new hit for Alex Chilton and the Box Tops just then climbing the charts. Johnston serves as a passable Ringo on ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" (itself only four months old) while the dreamy Wilson harmonies make it glow. The real joy of the session is hearing some of the band’s studio-aided hits performed by the band itself. If “Sloop John B,” “California Girls,” “God Only Knows,” and “Good Vibrations” sound less immortal than their original incarnations, it is also the sound of the genuine Beach Boys, human and wonderful. One can easily imagine them playing (if perhaps not writing) the same arrangements in the family garage a half-decade earlier. Behind the scenes, the Beach Boys were in chaos, having discarded three albums in one year. So it’s something of a surprise that Wild Honey is as relaxed-sounding an album as the band ever made. Given its short length and sometimes fragmentary tracks, it’s a shock that several of the outtakes included on Sunshine Tomorrow didn't make the official LP; it’s as good or better than much of the material that did. On the mysterious “Lonely Days”—“unknown” listed as author on the official release—Carl, Al, and Bruce pick up Pet Sounds’ melancholy while channeling it through a more innocent surf-ballad brightness. Brian’s “Time to Get Alone” achieves lost-masterpiece status with its denser string and horn mix, more like the baroque machinery of Pet Sounds and Smile than the syrupy vibes of the official 1969 version. But the magic of Sunshine Tomorrow is that the Beach Boys are all of these at once: chaotic and relaxed, naive and sophisticated, pop-oriented and intimate. Brian is both present and slipping away. The tendrils of Smile wend below the surface, a specter that continued to haunt their works, like the dreamy harmony explorations like “Cool, Cool Water” (eventually on 1970’s Sunflower), the stacked backing vocals on their cover of Stevie Wonder’s “I Was Made to Love Her,” and—most significantly—in another lost masterpiece Wild Honey outtake, “Can’t Wait Too Long.” There, Brian keeps working with an alluring section of “Wind Chimes” developed during Smile but jettisoned from its simpler Wild Honey version. Wondrously, there’s also a previously unheard solo piano version of Wilson and Van Dyke Parks’ Smile masterpiece “Surf’s Up.” “You know something, I better do the whole song,” Brian says after running through a few fragments, and thankfully he does, soaring into the perfect angelic high vocals. While brother Carl would finish the arrangement, sing lead, and make it the title (and closing) track of 1971’s Surf's Up, the November 1967 take is most likely the last time Brian played the song for decades, undocumented even in Keith Badman’s definitive day-by-day history. It’s a breathtaking performance. Like so much Beach Boys music, it is filled with dark undercurrents, a never-ceasing family turmoil that still acts as a counterpoint to the Endless Harmony brand the group so actively promoted. The Beach Boys never fully resolved the tension between pop maturity and summer fun, either musically or personally. They came closest with Wild Honey and the albums that followed over the next half-decade, perhaps mostly clearly on Brian’s “‘Til I Die,” before the best-selling 1974 greatest hits compilation Endless Summer sucked them onto the oldies circuit for good. But 1967 - Sunshine Tomorrow finds them firing in all creative directions at once for a brief, beautiful moment just as their wave started to recede. The box’s closing is reserved for an a capella mix of “Surfer Girl” from the band’s fake Hollywood live album, and there they are one last time, the fabulous Beach Boys, singing the sun into the surf.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-beach-boys-1967-sunshine-tomorrow/,"Capitol,Capitol",1967.0
51,David Bowie,Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles ’74),Rock,8.0,June 29 2017,Chris Randle,Contributor,"The 1975 BBC documentary Cracked Actor captured David Bowie at his lowest point, hollowed out so exquisitely by drugs that you wince to look. Riding a limo through the California desert, he mouths Aretha Franklin’s’s “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” like someone half-starved: a dark speck adrift in a blank landscape. “Since you’ve been in America,” the director Alan Yentob ventures, “you seem to have picked up a lot of the idioms and themes of American music, American culture. How’s that happened?” Bowie peers down at the carton of milk he’s been drinking from, and mentions the fly floating around there—a “foreign body,” just like him, gorging on the scenery. Cracked Actor documents the Diamond Dogs tour, which posed glam rock’s dying form in angles of severe decadence. Bowie spent millions of dollars on the sets, among them a nightmarish cityscape and glass-walled “asylum.” He sashayed along moving catwalks; he sang “Time” sitting cross-legged in the palm of a giant hand. Psychedelic Dietrich. The cocaine mania is still visible: such brittle abandon, so many fleetingly brilliant ideas. “Cracked Actor” the song, one of Bowie’s cruelest lyrics, describes a former movie star sniping at his prettier hirelings: “Forget that I’m fifty, ‘cause you just got paid.” On the Diamond Dogs tour, Bowie reduced this exchange to abstraction. He would do “Cracked Actor” wearing shades and holding a skull, eventually making out with the prop. It was one of the only times Bowie seemed uncertain about his next self. Midway through his scheduled 1974 dates, he dumped the elaborate theatre (imagine those dystopian facades rusting in the sun) and rebranded as the Soul Tour. Bowie’s first live album, David Live, was taken from that first half of the tour, but the recording process went badly wrong, forcing various players to overdub their parts in the studio; its final mix muffles all but the flimsiest noise. A damp jog would feel more intense than this “Suffragette City.” Bowie even grew to hate the cover, where he looks barely capable of holding up a microphone—he later joked that David Live should’ve been called David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory. With the new live album Cracked Actor, produced by Tony Visconti, Bowie’s longest-running collaborator tries to reconstruct that time, a moment of grand ambivalence. Cracked Actor the album and Cracked Actor the film draw on the same recordings, as if each were miming shadow puppets against a common light. Fans have bootlegged the show for almost three decades now—anyone could make this material sound better than David Live. Hearing drums here distinct from murk, you can tell how complex the rhythm of “1984” was, its groove swerving in circles to welcome every new element. Bowie spent the mid-‘70s obsessed with power, wielding it through deeper and deeper timbre, until his seductions seemed purged of emotion: a ballad sung by a vampire. Cracked Actor shows he was already using his phrasing to command attention. “Moonage Daydream” finds him slinking around like some cabaret diva, his voice alternately a pout, a gasp, and a broken squeal. “The Jean Genie” begins with Bowie at a diffident snarl, sliding lyrics along the lone guitar as it trembles in response. He sings the line about underwear, and the crowd whistles. The few Cracked Actor tracks considered for 1975’s Young Americans got cut from the final release, but it could be a premonition of that album. Bowie had changed his band mid-tour trying to approximate R&B, adding extra backup singers and the endlessly nimble guitarist Carlos Alomar. The bulk of the setlist draws on his last two glam-era records, neither of which were terribly coherent to begin with: Diamond Dogs especially resembles a paranoid collage, thrown together from disparate sources, including a 1984 musical vetoed by Orwell’s estate (rather too perfect given the author’s contempt towards “fashionable pansies.”) That allows the musicians to insert funk riffs or piano flourishes at will. Horn parts first recorded with blown-out, raucous production swoon and beguile. He always did hire the best. Bowie studied genres like captivating faces—the most devoted mimic a girl could hope for. “John, I’m Only Dancing (Again)” was such a strange gambit in 1974 that it only got released five years later, when every white anglo wanted to record disco singles. Closing out Cracked Actor, the song might be heard as a knowing joke, the parable of the horny bisexual: “If he gives it to you/He'd better take it from me.” In Alan Yentob’s documentary, Bowie sings it to no one and everyone, flicking his hair around. But that groove just keeps going, swiveling towards infinity, as backing vocals collapse his denials into a single word: “I’m dancing, dancing, dancing…”. The mask has splintered; the smile is helpless with yearning.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-cracked-actor-live-los-angeles-74/,"Parlophone,Parlophone",1974.0
52,Vince Staples,Big Fish Theory,Rap,8.7,June 23 2017,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"Vince Staples always has plenty to say, and he isn’t shy. Having taken on the entire
world and become something of an internet talking head, he’s now ready to figure out where, exactly, he fits into rap, and how rap fits into society at large. His sophomore album, Big Fish Theory, peers into the fishbowl of the fragile rap ecosystem and considers how “rappers are perceived and perceive themselves,” as he puts it. The result is a sleek rave-rap record that casually probes celebrity and class, a release that is half celebration of rap stardom and half critique of the often toxic culture it breeds. Staples is as clever as ever, but now the beats travel faster than his racing mind. The driving force behind Big Fish Theory is tempo; Staples exudes manic energy, departing from the unnerving calm that marked earlier releases. In the run-up to the album, he referred to the project as futuristic, and even labeled it Afrofuturism for a while, though he later claimed he was trolling. But the record is truly progressive and unconventional—“When the Vince Staples is playing, it’s 2029, bro,” he said on Beats 1. “Vince Staples is coming once again with the brand new sound.” While the sound in question is mostly retrofitted dance music that slopes to suit rap cadences, there’s something radical in how swiftly and easily he scales these craggy bops with fractured verses. And there’s a certain boldness and adventurousness to following your weirdest project with your cheekiest one. Summertime ‘06 was frequently grayscale and amelodic, an elaborate configuration of whale horns, discordant strings, and clanging, metallic rhythms. Big Fish Theory leans toward electronic club music (house and Detroit techno, especially), assembling an unlikely cabal of beatmakers including chief collaborator Zack Sekoff (a regular on the L.A. Beat scene), SOPHIE, Jimmy Edgar, GTA, and Flume, among others. The new album is smooth where Summertime ‘06 was jagged, foregoing the disquieting noise for something more functional, finding sophistication in streamlined motion, like an art installation set up in a nightclub. Even though the two albums are stylistically different and have conflicting agendas, Big Fish Theory feels like a natural progression. Amid the gleaming productions, he’s still exploring darkness. Staples’ 2016 EP, Prima Donna, opened with a budding rap star dying by suicide before tracing the path that led him there, and Big Fish Theory further explores the theme. Amy Winehouse speaks in the opening seconds of “Alyssa Interlude” (via an excerpt from a 2006 interview), setting the tone: “I’m quite a self-destructive person, so I guess I keep giving myself material,” she concludes, a sobering look into her process. Winehouse has long been a source of inspiration for Staples (the documentary Amy was the initial spark for Prima Donna), and he has openly criticized the public’s treatment of the late singer. The symbiotic relationship and resulting tension between a tortured artist and their audience weighs heavy on Vince’s mind (See: the “Señorita” video or the Prima Donna short film). These weighty questions seep into Big Fish Theory, where he sneaks in outcries like “Propaganda, press pan the camera/Please don’t look at me in my face/Everybody might see my pain/Off the rail, might off myself.” Suicide comes up elsewhere on the record. There are references to Basquiat and he calls himself the new River Phoenix. Amid the partying and paper-chasing, there are flashes of darkness and melancholy: “How am I supposed to have a good time when death and destruction is all I see?” There’s a chorus of other voices swirling around Staples on Big Fish Theory, but they mostly serve the larger sonic mosaic, echoing and amplifying Staples’ perspective. Guests generally appear in the margins, prove their usefulness, then vanish quickly—Damon Albarn sings for a few seconds, there are some hypeman-style vocals from A$AP Rocky, some garnishing R&B harmonies courtesy of Ray J, Kučka provides a quick interlude, Juicy J drops swag chants. They each play their roles well or at worst become part of the backdrop, aiding the general flow and texture of the album. But frequent collaborator Kilo Kish serves sort of secret weapon: her ability to move wispily through a song without disruption is key to several moments on the record, as on the entry on “Love Can Be…,” the softly, sweetly-sung coda on “Homage,” and the evaporating murmurs that lead “Crabs in a Bucket” into “Big Fish.” The biggest drop-in is Kendrick Lamar’s turn on the flossy “Yeah Right,” which delivers pyrotechnics as he and Vince dismantle tropes on rap’s inherent boastfulness. Songs on Big Fish Theory don’t operate the way we’re accustomed to Vince Staples songs operating. Staples has long traded on incisive and detail-oriented reporting, centering his observations and occupying all space in the mind’s eye. He is known for writing heavy, plainspoken confessions packed with detail. Here, the songs run on high-powered verses that tumble and split to accommodate the current, and his rapping is noticeably fleeter and more efficient. For other rappers, adjusting to the new mode might be awkward, but Staples’ lyrical precision allows him to cover just as much ground in fewer steps. The economy of his language makes for pithy dialogue (On “745”: “Eyes can’t hide your hate for me/Maybe you was made for the Maybelline/Spent so much tryna park the car/Barely got a tip for the maître d’”) and sharp, first-glance impressions of those in his orbit, adding bite-sized nuggets like “paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind.” Each passing stanza is a marvel of concision. Across 36 minutes, Vince Staples crams slinky disclosures on class and entitlement into infectious and eccentric club bangers. He leaves us with thoughts on fame’s corrupting influence and love’s power, all from a rising rap star who understands his reach and the limits of his celebrity. Big Fish Theory is a compact rap gem for dancing to or simply sitting with, an album that is as innovative as it is accessible; if not a glimpse into the future, then it’s at least an incisive look at the present. “This is Afrofuturism y’all can keep the other shit. We’re trying to get in the MoMA not your Camry,” Vince wrote, half-joking, in a since-deleted tweet. The funny thing is, Big Fish Theory might just be equipped for both.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/big-fish-theory/,"Def Jam,Blacksmith",2017.0
53,Radiohead,OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017,Rock,10.0,June 22 2017,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"As they regrouped to figure out what their third album might be, Radiohead faced, if not a crossroads, then an unusually open stretch of road. They had toured with Alanis Morissette in support of their second LP, 1995's The Bends. They had appeared, pale and blinking, before tanned and greased hordes on “MTV Spring Break,” wailing the chorus to a massive runaway hit that was now fading in their rearview. On their first two records, they had worked with two different conventional rock producers, and now they itched to cut tether from professional studios altogether. They had earned the freedom to thrash around, to spend some record label money and burn some of the industry goodwill they’d accumulated pursuing whatever they wanted. So what would that be? It’s still funny to think, two decades later, that Thom Yorke’s first answer to that question was to create Radiohead’s first “positive” album. No more iron lungs, or songs inspired by brutal gun rampages, he swore: This time, he told NME, “I’m deliberately writing down all the positive things I hear or see.” It’s unclear what happened to that album. OK Computer obviously wasn’t it. But there has always been a tantalizing alternate-history version of Radiohead’s third LP lurking behind the finished product. Their sessions weren’t exactly a deep-dive into hell, despite the record’s now-concrete reputation as a piece of digital-age prophecy. For every dour “Paranoid Android” thunderclap, there was a shimmering, lighter “Melatonin” as its B-side. More than 20 songs were winnowed down to 12, in fact, and the narrative the discarded tracks suggest has been kept under quite deliberate lock and key by the band. But now, years on, they are cracking open its vaults, perhaps to slyly underscore the point that they were always more human, and connected to good old hoary rock music, than their reputation suggests. OKNOTOK is something a little more interesting than a remaster with tacked-on B-sides and rarities, even if that’s technically what it is. The “rarities” included here have never been all that rare, and many of the songs included on this set (“How I Made My Millions,” “Polyethylene”) live in readily accessible digital eternity on Spotify and have been performed live for more than a decade. Radiohead have always treated these songs, the ones that came before OK Computer truly took shape, with a wry sort of kid-brother affection: The storied B-side “Lift,” which finally sees inclusion here, was once seen as a “bog-shite B-side,” in the words of Ed O’Brien. It’s a lovely, weightless strummer of a song, and watching them send it shimmering out over a field of blissed-out stadium concertgoers in 1996 is the clearest mental picture you can get of this alternate history come to life. But “Lift’s” reputation for positivity might be a little confused; in the song’s lyrics, the title is a noun, not a verb. The protagonist is stuck in an elevator, a piece of mundane modern technology that has suddenly halted and trapped us inside it. That lilting chorus of “Today is the first day of the rest of your days” isn’t a promise; it’s a death sentence, and the hapless soul inside it is doomed to expire soundlessly in the intestines of some soulless corporate edifice. The song doesn’t land all that far away from the chiming lullaby “No Surprises,” then, with its job that slowly kills you and the bruises that won’t heal. The most fun to be had with OKNOTOK is in these line-blurring moments, hearing how the lost material informs the original album. After The Bends, Radiohead were briefly lumped in with the other bands in the “Britpop” scene, an association they never relished. If “Palo Alto” had seen official release, it would have stamped them with the brand for life; with the lava-lamp psychedelia of its winding central guitar riff, it is very nearly a Kula Shaker song, and it also happens to be the song that gave OK Computer its name. The same goes for “Pearly,” in which Yorke leers about “vanilla milkshakes” and moans “use me, darling, use me” over a nearly-Led Zeppelin III-sized stomp with an arpeggiated coda straight out of “House of the Rising Sun.” It was “a dirty song for people who use sex for dirty things,” Yorke used to joke when introducing the song in concert. This fondness for camp and schlock has always been latent in Radiohead’s music, and teasing it out doesn’t take too much detective work. The original “Paranoid Android” closed with a wild, straight-outta-Deep Purple keyboard solo that, Jonny Greenwood joked to Rolling Stone recently for an oral history, is hard to get through “without clutching your sofa for support.” Alongside the earliest live versions of songs like “No Surprises” and “Let Down,” they often treated audiences to a plaintive, reverent cover of Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better,” the AM-radio theme to the Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. The ghost of Bond followed them once they decamped from their self-built studio Canned Applause to set up shop in a 16th-century Bath mansion owned by Jane Seymour—she played a Bond girl in Live and Let Die. And it has followed them ever since: It’s worth remembering that Radiohead were tapped to write a Bond theme for Spectre, and obliged, only to have their offering vetoed. The lyric “Kill me Sarah/Kill me again/With love” (“Lucky”) feels tailor-made for a suggestive title sequence full of undulating silhouettes. Many songs on the original OK Computer feel written for a desk-drone, earthbound version of England’s most famous fictional spy, the sort of soul who whistles “bring down the government, they don't speak for us” while dutifully hitting “Zoom” on government surveillance footage. “In an interstellar burst/I am back to save the universe !!” Yorke sang, ironically, on “Airbag,” a line that could be mocking or hopeful or just wistful—like Pink Floyd, the classic rock band often mentioned as an aesthetic forebear to OK Computer, Radiohead succeeded in part by writing superhero themes for introverts. Radiohead have been at least as brilliant at packaging and positioning themselves, step by step, as they have been in making and sequencing albums. They have always been studious draftsmen who seem to intuit on a cellular level when a song is “ready,” both as a compositional and a brick in their narrative. This is how their catalog ends up with ghosts hovering over it: When “Nude” finally appeared on 2007’s In Rainbows, Radiohead superfans felt the gratifying chill of recognition—this was the classic “Big Ideas,” played for years at gigs, finally given flesh. Now that they have arrived at an autumnal, valedictory stage in their career arc, they are mining drama from gestures of release and resignation. “True Love Waits,” Yorke’s most unguarded song, finally appeared as the closer to their sumptuous, open-hearted ninth album A Moon Shaped Pool. And they have restored “I Promise,” a pure beam of sunlight that had no room on either The Bends or OK Computer, to this edition, another note in an ongoing song about throwing open doors and embracing surrender. “I won’t run away no more/I promise” Yorke sings on the song, the dewy, angelic falsetto of his ’90s years miraculously restored. Years removed from its source, its impact is multiplied tenfold. In 1996, it was a path towards adult-contemporary pop radio; today, it’s an exquisitely faded Polaroid.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/radiohead-ok-computer-oknotok-1997-2017/,"Capitol,XL",1997.0
54,Halsey,hopeless fountain kingdom,Pop/R&B,6.5,June 7 2017,Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,"Halsey’s sophomore album *hopeless fountain kingdom *comes with a backstory to rival an ARG. There were actual fountains and actual newspapers sent to actual doorsteps, but in 2017 this is the status quo. Tove Lo’s debut as the voice of Max Martin’s Wolf Cousins writing collective was presented as a four-part concept album about emotional turmoil. Beyoncé’s last two albums are bona fide franchises. Artists from The Fame-era Lady Gaga to suddenly-woke Katy Perry conduct album campaigns about how their music truly means something. It’s easy to see why: Streaming is a hopeless penny fountain, radio is a hopeless playlist kingdom, so one scrounges any extramusical interest one can. And most musicians prefer to think they’re making art, not content—especially with an audience that demands increasing creative control from artists and an industry that doesn’t keep up. This is certainly less outwardly exploitative than the antiquated pop model of finding a teen, then corrupting their fictionalized innocent image for public ogling. Halsey’s bid at true meaning on hopeless fountain kingdom is to simply prove she’s “more than capable of writing radio music,” as she told Rolling Stone. The concept is ambitious, but the product ticks all the boxes: staid piano ballad (“Sorry”), In the Zone* *nostalgia (“Walls Could Talk”), R&B dilettantism (“Don’t Play,” Quavo-assisted “Lie”), recreations of proven hits (“Now or Never”). Of course, ever since she said she was raised on Biggie and Nirvana while getting high on kind and legal bud on *Badland’*s “New Americana,” Halsey has been accused of inauthenticity. Everything from her hairstyle to her racial and sexual identity has been seized upon as clues to debunk the enterprise. *The New York Times *called her “a millennial built in a lab.” Grantland: “Halsey’s life can be reduced to a perfect millennial construct.” Halsey lamented to Billboard the “conspiracy theorists who think [she] was crafted in a boardroom.” However, who but an actual Tumblr teen would imagine herself on a Rider-Waite card or dream up a post-teenage apocalypse where the only scarcity is connection? “100 Letters” sets the scene: dingy floors, negs, and would-be love notes destroyed in the wash. The production is fittingly dirgelike with new age percussion loops and far away decaying guitar samples, like an Enigma track left overnight in a dive-bar bathroom. “Alone,” plush with brass and cellos, also sounds ‘90s: like a track off Everything But the Girl’s Temperamental if someone were actively having a panic attack over it. The lyrics cut through parties and drinks and hangers-on as Halsey’s vocal climbs the scale, increasingly agitated, up to the last, worst anxiety: “I know you’re dying to meet me, but I can just tell you this/Baby as soon as you meet me, you’ll wish that you never did.” “Eyes Closed” portrays that timeless gambit of getting over someone by getting under someone else, as well as the timely gambit of getting into co-writer The Weeknd’s production drears, withering melodies, and joyless sex. But while the backing vocals sound like Tesfaye, he’d never write something so abandoned as “he’ll never stay—they never do.” The album’s not entirely anhedonic. The heart-thud pace and breathless quotables in “Heaven in Hiding” suggest genuine lust—that lurid diary entry with 25 blank pages on either side. Nor, despite the sheer quantity of shitty dudes here, is it just men who fail to connect. “Strangers” shimmers and yearns like a recent Tegan and Sara cut, with Heartthrob co-writer Greg Kurstin and with Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui as duettist. Jauregui, like Halsey, is bisexual, and “Strangers” is Halsey’s stated attempt to get a love song between two women onto pop radio. Not coincidentally, it contains the album’s most nuanced lyrics, the coupling that’s most promising yet most out of reach. On an album full of radio experiments, some succeed—“100 Letters,” “Walls Could Talk” and “Alone” demonstrate the perennially fertile sound of alt-pop—and some inevitably fail. The two R&B tracks are a swagger void. “Devil in Me” is hopeless fountain kingdom’s requisite Sia track, and like so many others, Halsey makes it sound like anything but. More damningly, style never quite matches substance. That could be the young creative’s “taste gap”; Halsey is just 22. Or it could be the market. Is lead single “Now or Never,” as the story goes, “one part in the center of a long narrative that tells the story of two people in love despite the forces trying to keep them apart”? Or is it just writer Starrah commissioned to make another, poppier “Needed Me”—less prickly, less urban, less precise with the vocals? To some, it might not matter. Others might await a kingdom built on more than just airplay.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23301-hopeless-fountain-kingdom/,Astralwerks,2017.0
55,Snoop Dogg,Neva Left,Rap,7.0,June 1 2017,Rebecca Haithcoat,Contributor,"Like frat parties and Razor scooters, rapping is for the young. Braggadocio, especially when it’s based on how many girls you’re fucking, guns you’re holding, and pounds of coke you’re moving, doesn't look good on older men. And just like a dad trying to hold court in his old football locker room, it comes off as desperate to keep reliving your glory days or, even worse, rap like you’re still on the come-up when it’s well-reported you’ve been tucked away in a mansion for years. With varying degrees of success, rappers nearing middle age have tried to talk about wives and art collections and other facets of adulting, but few of their longtime fans want to be reminded that they’re not 22 anymore. If rap is your means of artistic expression and your way to make a living, what’s a rapper nearing middle age to do? Snoop Dogg is one of the lucky ones. He’s savvy, maneuvering his career with shows like “Snoop Dogg’s Father Hood” and the endearing documentary series “Coach Snoop” so that his image now reflects a family man who has been married nearly 20 years and is a compassionate role model for the kids in his peewee football league. He adopted Wiz Khalifa early in the fellow weed aficionado’s career, re-upping his relevance and sealing his status as a legend with a new generation. With the launch of his cannabis-centered lifestyle site Merry Jane in fall 2015, he shifted from stoner to a champion of legalized marijuana. He’s so universally adored that Kylie Jenner hasn’t been excoriated for using “Kylizzlemynizzl,” a riff on his popular slang, as her Snapchat name. Despite those endeavors, the title of his very enjoyable latest album, Neva Left, is accurate. Snoop Dogg really hasn’t ever taken a break from music. In fact, he’s been something of a machine, cranking out almost two dozen records in as many years since the 1993 debut of his bona fide classic Doggystyle. Happily, on Neva Left, Snoop hasn’t become a grumpy old man, nor is he trying to keep up with the kids. Snoop’s gift is two-pronged: a penchant for always dropping into the pocket and his low, smoky growl of a voice, which curls and stretches words in such a distinctive way no one has ever mimicked it successfully. “Trash Bags”—produced by Atlanta-based Musik MajorX, featuring an Uncle Luke sample and K Camp’s pleasingly detached hook—is the closest Snoop comes to trying on a new style. “Lavender,” produced by BADBADNOTGOOD and Kaytranada, is a gorgeously trippy track, but it’s the foreign entity in a game of “one of these things is not like the other.” Mostly, though, Snoop keeps the features and production within his era—Battlecat, Rick Rock, Devin the Dude, Too $hort. And why not? It might not always be on trend, but on his 15th studio album, Snoop sounds in great shape and like he’s having the time of his life. “Moment I Feared” features him slipping into double time as nimbly as any young whippersnapper, and just try not to get “Swivel” stuck in your head. Lots of nods to classic records—J-Massive’s “Bacc in da Dayz” samples “Check the Rhime,” “Promise You This” interpolates Too $hort’s (or One Way’s, depending on how you look at it) “Don’t Fight the Feeling”—let old fans reminisce and new ones discover. Snoop’s other strategy is simply pointing out the obvious instead of trying to be the cool dad, acknowledging his age and offering advice like the OG he is. On “Go On,” an instant cruising classic that indulges his abiding love for slick ’80s R&B, he mentions riding bikes with his grandson in the park. The one dent in his armor is hitting on a girl literally young enough to be his daughter on the fun, degrading (some things haven’t changed) bop “Toss It”: “She say she went to school with my young son … told me that her daddy was a Eight Tray Crip, I did time with the nigga.” Still, letting go of the good ol’ days is harder the older you get. On “Neva Left,” the album opener, the first words out of Snoop’s mouth are, “I gang bang to the fullest.” The last are shout outs to Crip sets across L.A. and Long Beach. Like Bruce Springsteen sings on “Glory Days,” “I hope when I get old I don’t sit around thinking about it—but I probably will.”",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23320-neva-left/,"EMPIRE,Doggy Style",2017.0
56,Dan Auerbach,Waiting on a Song,Rock,6.7,June 1 2017,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"On the opening title track of his new solo album, Dan Auerbach sings a song about wanting to write a song—before invoking the age-old myth that it’s often best to just stop trying and let the tune find you. “Songs don’t grow on trees/You gotta pick ’em out of the breeze,” he sings on “Waiting on a Song,” a twinkly hit of countrified pop that, as the album cover suggests, sounds very much like it came wafting in as Auerbach reclined on a pile of leaves. But the end result is ultimately a testament to the great paradox of songwriting: it takes a lot of heavy lifting to make something that sounds so effortless. Auerbach moved from his native Akron, Ohio to Nashville back in 2010, where he has since overseen the Black Keys become one of the biggest, busiest rock bands in America (and by extension, became an in-demand producer for everyone from Dr. John to Lana Del Rey.) Now, comfortably entrenched in his Easy Eye Sound studio, Auerbach’s approach for Waiting on a Song was a lot more like Planning for a Song. The album assembles a roots-rock dream team that includes famous names like John Prine, Duane Eddy, and Mark Knopfler, but also seasoned Nashville tunesmiths like Luke Dick, Michael Heeney, and David Ferguson. As per Music City tradition, songwriting for the album was treated like the job that it is, with tunes developed and recorded on a set weekly schedule. The result is an album that both bears very little relation to Auerbach’s past efforts, yet nonetheless exudes his signature retro-soul fetishism. Whether it was his 2009 solo debut Keep It Hid or his 2015 foray with the Arcs, Auerbach’s outside pursuits have had the Keys’ muddy footprints all over them. But Waiting on a Song could be his first record without a drop of the blues in the mix, with Auerbach favoring the less gruff, more melodic register in his voice atop a studio-smoothed concoction of country, soul, folk, and power pop. With “Livin’ in Sin” and shuffling “Shine on Me” (powered by Knopfler’s unmistakable thumb-pickin’ tone), the album essentially functions as Auerbach’s less-democratic version of the Traveling Wilburys, like one of those ’70s-focused satellite radio stations where hit songs from different genres are grouped together by virtue of their common decade and blur into one another. The symphonic soul of “Malibu Man” crosswires the grooves of Al Green with the glittery choruses of T. Rex; “King of a One Horse Town” comes on like Neil Young’s “Down by the River” played on acoustic guitar and produced by John Barry. While Waiting on a Song is casual in execution, it’s extremely intricate in construction, with each disco-string sweep, brass-section stab, and razor-sharp acoustic strum deployed with push-button precision. At times, the album feels less like a traditional singer/songwriter affair than a business card for Auerbach’s studio. Alas, Waiting on a Song also betrays the limitations of its song-factory set-up, in that the consummate craftsmanship renders the lyrics a secondary, impersonal concern. Even if he isn’t explicitly singing the blues here, Auerbach still peddles its well-worn witchy-woman cliches. The undercooked folk-funk of “Cherrybomb” spins a gold-digger caricature about a girl who’s “sweeter than an apple pie” but bolts “as soon as my money went away.” And though the banjo-plucked “Stand by My Girl” initially sounds like a pledge of commitment, it’s delivered by a back-door man who’s afraid “she’ll kill me if I don’t.” They’re the sort of eye-rolling lines that are more easily digested within the Black Keys, but are left hung out to dry by this album’s pristine production and light-hearted approach. For all of Auerbach’s eagerness to deliver the Music Row-worthy songwriting goods, Waiting on a Song can you leave you wishing he had waited a little longer.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23276-waiting-on-a-song/,Easy Eye Sound,2017.0
57,Gorillaz,Humanz,"Electronic,Rock",6.9,April 28 2017,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"In the spring of 2016, Damon Albarn tells Pusha T to picture, if he would, an album that envisioned Donald Trump winning the presidency. Albarn was working on new Gorillaz material, the first in six years, and he had been squinting at the man brandishing his shriveled claws at his Republican challengers and bragging about his dick size and imagining him in charge of the free world. “When it really happened,” Pusha T said, “I was like, ‘Wait a minute…I started wondering like, what type of crystal ball did this guy have?” It’s a funny little anecdote, considering how closely the fifth studio album from Gorillaz resembles its predecessors in tone, style, and mood. The cartoon-band project of Albarn and Jamie Hewlett has evolved into a surprising little institution by relying on a sturdy formula: Return every few years with an album loaded up with au courant guests and a doomsday vibe that fits whatever disaster is currently dominating the headlines. Post-9/11 panic? Great Recession malaise? Trumpian discontent? Gorillaz have a song for that somewhere. Hitting play on a Spotify blender of Gorillaz will take you across eras, continents, genres—Bobby Womack will show up, as will Lou Reed and Ibrahim Ferrer and Tina Weymouth. But somehow, it will all sound like the inside of the same suburban-mall Gamestop, circa 2000. Damon Albarn’s vague ideas about societal passivity and dystopia feel roughly the same now as they did around the release of the first Gorillaz album, and they will probably feel the same in 2028, when President Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is running for reelection. As usual, the guest list on Humanz promises untold riches—Vince Staples, Danny Brown, Kelela, Pusha T, Mavis Staples, D.R.A.M., and Jehnny Beth from Savages—on which the music doesn’t deliver. No matter the rotating cast, Gorillaz tracks come in a few basic colors and flavors: A stew of fat drums, gloomy synth patches, crooned and muttered hooks from Albarn in the background. With this reliable frame, every guest ends up smeared with Gorillaz makeup and bearing a whiff of Suicide Squad-style corporate menace. Humanz mostly feels like a playlist as a result, with each song acting as a self-contained referendum on how this particular guest fares in Gorillaz World. Vince Staples sprints his way through “Ascension” without finding much traction in his surroundings. The joy and weightlessness that Popcaan brings so naturally to his usual guest spots is extinguished by the the drizzly murk of “Saturnz Barz.” De La Soul, who showed up on Gorillaz’s 2005 hit “Feel Good, Inc.” and on Plastic Beach, are jostled by a clomping, inelegant beat on “Momentz” that gives them none of the room to sound effortless or funny or wry or observant. They sound lost in the middle of the wrong party. “The wrong party” or “the right party” is a useful Gorillaz rubric. Grace Jones is at the wrong party on “Charger,” which introduces you to a wriggling little two-note worm of a guitar lick before Jones shows up to mutter a few words. Neither she, nor Albarn, nor that wiggling guitar, seem to have thought of much else to hold your attention. Danny Brown and Kelela are at home on the clanking synth-popper “Submission,” pitching in measured jolts of wistfulness and pop-eyed panic. The Chicago legend Peven Everett sounds fantastic on “Strobelite,” spilling effortless warmth all over the track. Singer and rapper and Virginia ham D.R.A.M. is at the right party, pitching in stacked, breathy multipart harmonies behind Albarn’s lead vocal, on “Andromeda.” But the sneaky star of that song is the streaking comet-trail synth that repeatedly claims center stage. It sounds thick and wispy all at once, a lovingly rendered globule of sound so dazzling it turns everything around it superfluous. Guests may come and go, but Albarn’s menagerie of pawn-shop synth gear remains the reason the party exists. The most powerful and heartfelt moment on all of Humanz comes when all the humans disappear, and Albarn is left to himself to croon sadly to his machines: “Busted and Blue” could have been a song on the last Blur album. It explores similar feelings of glassy-eyed melancholy and resignation. And most importantly, it sounds gorgeous, full of digitized finger snaps that spiral out like space junk drifting across the atmosphere. The synth washes here feel like orchestral string sections, and as the emotion intensifies the flimsy Gorillaz pretense burns off again, as it does on every Gorillaz album: All the masks and cameos aside, this still feels like a Damon Albarn solo project, a place for him to treat the studio like the welcoming arms of oblivion, and for us to join him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23146-humanz/,"Parlophone,Warner Bros.",2017.0
58,John Mayer,The Search for Everything,Rock,4.9,April 19 2017,Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,"John Mayer has spent the past decade cultivating a dubious notoriety. In an era somehow populated with multiple David Duke gaffes, he’s the guy whose reputation was tangibly harmed by it. He also makes music, which is perennially hampered by four problems. One: overcompensating with clever-clever lyrics and interview stunts because of a deep embarrassment at sharing a market segment with Shawn Mendes and Ed Sheeran. Two: a willingness to play PR ball and juice up otherwise bland singles with celebrity gossip, admitting to the New York Times that at the center of “Still Feel Like Your Man” was Katy Perry, a confession certain to please the tabloids. Three: a clockwork fascination with the trends of the times, which in 2017, means yacht-rock smarm with a pinch of Dave Longstreth and James Blake’s falsetto-processing trickery. And, most damningly: a fundamental boringness to his records designed to be offset by a winning personality. He writes musical nonentities that resemble entities when sung by a sensitive troubadour, except this troubadour is off spewing napalm through Playboy’s pages. All of this would be best left in the past if The Search for Everything hadn’t dredged it up as part of a deliberate tour of contrition—his second. For the public, we get another round of apologies for the antics that supposedly torched his career. The industry gets a course-correction from the studied, Laurel Canyon-inflected folk that actually did torch his career (it’s telling that his last two actual hits were a Katy Perry duet and a Beyoncé cover) into slick soft-rock. It’s a strategy last used by Robin Thicke on Paula, another expensive plea of an album released by a media heel. Like Paula, Mayer’s seventh studio album backfires spectacularly. One never forgets how much and how blandly Mayer doth protest. He’s undoubtedly a good curator of musicians, and his core trio—including longtime D’Angelo bassist Pino Palladino and veteran studio drummer Steve Jordan—lend the record an understated groove. There will likely be few albums this year so consistently pleasant. But even though *The Search for Everything *is his admitted attempt to produce megahits again, with a sound adjacent to the slick ’70s yacht rock that’s become an obsession of Max Martin among others, he’s reluctant to commit to anything more than pleasant. The closest is “In the Blood,” with stadium-ish percussion and sunny backing vocals from an uncredited Sheryl Crow, but even that only goes halfway: neither as undeniable as he’s aiming for nor as scuzzy as he probably wants. Then there’s that old inescapable problem, the part where John Mayer says words. “Emoji of a Wave” is a perfectly fine ballad, with a perfectly fine Cat Stevens lilt and harmonies by the Beach Boys’ Al Jardine. But then there’s the title. Why? Nothing in the song suggests emoji, or anything past 1975. The only explanation is Mayer trying to spritz it up with cheap modernity, which is bad lol. The limply funky “Rosie” is an early-’00s throwback, in the sense that Mayer’s bit about learning (just for her!) the Spanish words for “excuse me” and “I’m sorry” is gratuitous Latin courting. “Roll It on Home” and “Love on the Weekend” are windswept country-pop songs of the kind the Nashville songwriting machine commissions by the dozens, but Nashville would never greenlight overwritten lyrics like “I’ll be dreamin’ of the next time we can go into another serotonin overflow.” (Even Róisín Murphy barely pulled that off, and at least she got the right bonding hormone.) It’s progress, probably, that Mayer keeps the condescension to a dull sneer, but this also makes everything sound that much more anodyne. “Still Feel Like Your Man” asks how sympathetic can a narrator really be when he begins by bragging about how the prettiest girl in the room totally wants him? It also asks what if, instead of Justin Timberlake, Michael Jackson’s “Love Never Felt So Good” spliced in a frat boy? It’s a remarkable demonstration of Mayer’s fundamental problem: suffering simultaneously from an excess of taste and an oblivious lack of it, a Fleetwood Mac heart and a Jack Johnson brain. If only he could start recording separately from himself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23113-the-search-for-everything/,Columbia,2017.0
59,Kendrick Lamar,DAMN.,Rap,9.2,April 18 2017,Matthew Trammell,Contributor,"Life is one funny motherfucker, it’s true. “DUCKWORTH.,” the last song on Kendrick Lamar's fourth studio album DAMN., tells a winding story about Anthony from Compton and Ducky from Chicago, whose paths cross first over KFC biscuits, and again, 20 years later, when Ducky’s son records a song about the encounter for Anthony’s record label. It’s a precious origin story, the stuff of rock docs and hood DVDs, and it’s delivered with such precision, vivid detail, and masterful pacing that it can’t possibly be true. But it’s a tale too strange to be fiction, and too powerful not to believe in—just like its author. Kendrick Lamar has proven he’s a master storyteller, but he’s been saving his best plot twist this whole time, waiting until he was ready, or able, to pull it off. Storytelling has been Lamar’s greatest skill and most primary mission, to put into (lots of) words what it's like to grow up as he did—to articulate, in human terms, the intimate specifics of daily self-defense from your surroundings. Somehow, he’s gotten better. The raps on his fourth studio album DAMN. jab mercilessly like a sewing machine. His boyish nasal instrument is distinct and inimitable as it slithers up and down in pitch on “PRIDE.” Even when Lamar sounds like Eminem, or Drake, or OutKast, he sounds like himself, and he arguably outpaces them all as a writer. On “FEAR.,” he relays daily threats from his mom (“I’ll beat your ass, keep talking back/I’ll beat your ass, who bought you that? You stole it”) and from his neighbors (“I’ll probably die because I ain’t know Demarcus was snitching/I’ll probably die at these house parties fucking with bitches”) over low-slung blues stirred by The Alchemist. Lamar’s recitation is so effortless you wonder where he breathes, or if he does at all. Kendrick is a relic of the mid-aughts rap blog era, where bedroom WordPress pages would post .zips of albums by amateurs. After years of such releases, Kendrick dropped a self-titled EP in 2009 that featured Big Pooh from Little Brother and elicited such Nah Right comments as “I like the beats on this” and “who da fuk?” Accolades swelled with each project; by 2011, he was considering signing with Dr. Dre; by 2013, he was playing “SNL” and touring with Kanye West. He came of age with his fans, and by 2015’s To Pimp a Butterfly, he put to music their chest-clenched frustrations. Ever the curtain-puller, he released an album of untitled and unmastered drafts and grew his hair out. His short absence, even after lending Taylor Swift a verse, has been made to feel longer by his media shyness and a surging tide of new rappers shuttled out daily. Throughout it all, he’s avoided the boxed-in fates of predecessors like Nas and peers like J. Cole through an electric originality and curiosity. He mastered rap not for mastery’s sake, but to use it as a form, undeterred by slow-eared fans who’ll only highlight his “simplest lines.” His best new trick is repetition; it offsets his density and drills his ideas, as enthralling as a Sunday sermon or pre-fight chirp session. There have been few threats committed to record as sincere as, “Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman/Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother”—you tick down the list along with him, slot in your own lifelong bonds with loved ones. Such internal processing plays out through the album’s Greek chorus, via the singer Bēkon, who speaks in riddles of balance throughout: “Is it wickedness, is it weakness;” “Love’s gonna get you killed, but pride’s gonna be the death of you;” “It was always me versus the world/Until I found it’s me versus me.” DAMN. is best in these philosophical spaces. It lags slightly around the center, where the concept loosens: “LOYALTY.,” with Rihanna, has all the makings of a radio mainstay this summer, and is as low-stakes as the platform demands; it’s always fun to hear Rih rap, and her presence is its most interesting aspect. “LUST.” would sound better if it weren’t next to an ear-worm as tender as “LOVE.,” which slow-dances between Zacari falsettos and Lamar’s sheepish read of the girl who fills him up. Between the two tracks, it’s easy to tell which force is tugging at him harder. The record’s few lulls succumb to what surrounds them. The springboard bounce of “HUMBLE.,” the war chant of “DNA.,” and hot steel of “XXX.” show Kendrick in his element, fast and lucid, like Eazy-E with college credits and Mike WiLL beats. The production is taut and clean, but schizophrenic, often splicing two or three loops into a track and swaying between tempos, closer in kin to good kid, m.A.A.d city’s siren-synths than Butterfly’s brass solos. If he was “black as the moon” on his last album, he’s an “Israelite” here, refusing to identify himself by the shade of his skin but fluent in the contents of his D.N.A. Butterfly floated along to soften its scathing stance—“We hate po-po” sounds better over a smooth saxophone—but with so many “wack artists” in play, what’s the reward for upliftment? Kendrick is so alone at his altitude that when he acknowledges Fox News, let alone Donald Trump, it feels like a favor to them both. Still, the album exists for “DUCKWORTH.” It’s the final piece of the TDE puzzle, a homegrown label of Compton natives that happened to deliver the best rapper of his generation. If we’re to believe the song’s last gunshot—and its seamless loop back to track one—much of DAMN. is written from the perspective of a Kendrick Lamar who grew up without a father to guide him away from the sinful temptations outside his home. He bobs in and out of this perspective, but the repeated pledges to loyalty and martyrdom evoke the life and mind of a young gang member who carries his neighborhood flag because no one’s proved to him that he shouldn’t. These choices, Lamar suggests, aren’t pre-determined or innate, but in constant dialogue with and in reaction to their surrounding circumstances. They aren’t above or beneath anyone who can hear his voice. Success and failure choose their subjects at their whim; we’re as grateful as Kendrick for his fate.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23147-damn/,"Interscope,Top Dawg Entertainment",2017.0
60,Soundgarden,Ultramega OK,Rock,7.3,March 20 2017,Maura Johnston,Contributor,"Soundgarden’s ascent from Seattle’s punk scene to rock’s upper echelon wasn’t preordained, but it was probably inevitable. Their first full-length, 1988’s Ultramega OK, expands upon the promise offered by their two Sub Pop EPs, the careening Screaming Life and the glitchy, funked-up Fopp. The band’s assault is sharper and more focused, their musical ideas borrowing from blues (and blooze), punk, tape-manipulation experiments, and dredged-in-mud riffing. It originally came out on the even-then-it-was-legendary punk label SST, although its 2017 reissue on Sub Pop puts a neat little bow on the band’s long career. Soundgarden’s path led them to arena tours and classic-rock-radio canonization, and Sub Pop has grown from a fanzine into a powerhouse, persisting and thriving through multiple independent-rock gold rushes. Both entities are keenly aware of their legacies—and the fact that they’re worthy of exploration. “Flower,” a swirling tale of a woman whose hard-partying lifestyle leads her to an early grave, opens Ultramega OK. Years after more straightforward Soundgarden tracks like the glittering “Black Hole Sun” and the hiccuping “Pretty Noose” became rock-radio staples, it’s still one of the band’s best pop offerings, anchored by a chug that blossoms out of gauzy reverb, given depth by sonics that recall a muddied-up copy of Physical Graffiti (guitarist Kim Thayil has said that the humming feedback came from him placing his guitar on the floor near his amp, then blowing on its strings). The arrangement is animated by Chris Cornell’s gritted-teeth vocal performance, which only comes into full-voiced yawp briefly. Its appeal to both sides of MTV’s late-’80s late-night rock aisle—Headbangers Ball and 120 Minutes—presaged the eventual cultural dominance of “the Seattle sound” and the alt-rock gold rush that followed. Ultramega OK’s most instructive lesson, though, is how that craved-for aesthetic stemmed from an ever-shifting ideal. The twisted thrash of “Circle of Power,” led by a gasping vocal from bassist Hiro Yamamoto, gets extra tense because of its momentary pauses for breath; the creeping-death march of “Beyond the Wheel” is sandwiched between the tape-warp interludes “665” and “667” and a masterful vocal by Cornell to give it extra eeriness at the height of PMRC-stoked mania about “occult music”; the sludgy cover of the blues chestnut “Smokestack Lightning,” which pairs Cornell’s wail with the band’s 45-at–33 grind, flips the idea of cocky ’80s rockers taking on the blues face-first into a moss-swarmed bog. (“We learned the Howlin’ Wolf version,” Cornell told Sounds. “We didn’t know it had been covered a lot.” Yamamoto deflated Cornell’s insistence: “I did and I told you not to put it on the record. It’s a bit crass—a bit like getting B.B. King to sit up on stage with you.”) Humor was also key, as it was for so many of the band’s compatriots; crediting the album-ending patch of tape hiss and amp-unplugging to “One Minute of Silence” (an homage to his and Yoko Ono’s “Two Minutes Silence”) is one of the album’s more obvious jokes. Skin Yard’s Jack Endino, whose list of ’80s production credits could double as an early greatest-hits list for Sub Pop, remixed Ultramega OK for this reissue; Thayil’s liner notes go into diplomatic depth about why the band was ultimately unhappy with the SST-released version of the album. Endino’s tweaks don’t render the album spit-shined, thank God, but they do accentuate certain instrumental details more clearly—the clashing guitars on the loop-de-loop slacker portrait “He Didn’t,” the snap of Matt Cameron’s drums on the paranoiac “Head Injury.” (The most notable difference between the two versions is the absence of then-labelmates Sonic Youth’s “Death Valley ’69,” a sample of which served as a radio-static-swathed transition between the sludge of “Smokestack Lightning” and the anxiety of “Nazi Driver.”) Endino’s liner notes delve into the details of crafting the new mix—sourcing the effects unit that made “665” and “667” so immediate and freaky, fixing a missing snare hit on “Flower.” Endino also recorded the early-stage versions of a few Ultramega OK tracks that round out this reissue; they add to the story by showing how much more precise the band got in the year or so after they recorded the Screaming Life EP, with the two versions of the single-chord grind “Incessant Mace” showing how that song’s brimming dread was the result of a fair amount of experimentation. Revisiting Ultramega OK, it’s obvious in retrospect that Soundgarden were going to clamber to an exalted position in rock. They managed to balance their mad-scientist tendencies with an innate savvy about how to craft a rock song—even when they were six minutes long and based around one chord. The album captures the band on the eve of being swept into the major-label system, and it predicts how they would wring rock hits out of unexpected building blocks.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22986-ultramega-ok/,"Sub Pop,Sub Pop",1988.0
61,Depeche Mode,Spirit,"Electronic,Rock",6.8,March 18 2017,Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,"The 14th studio album from synth giants Depeche Mode begins with frontman Dave Gahan declaring that “We are not there yet/We have not evolved.” It’s the first of many admonitions Gahan issues on what turns out to be the most pointedly topical and compassionate effort in the band’s career. Over solemn piano chords and a lockstep electro groove that hints at the cadence of a protest march, Gahan laments how “we feel nothing inside” as we “track it all with satellites” and “watch men die in real time.” By track two, “Where’s the Revolution,” Gahan begins calling for out-and-out revolt, chiding the audience: “Come on people/You’re letting me down.” In his golden-throated baritone, Gahan reminds us that we’ve been “pissed on/For too long,” our “rights abused” by governments who “Manipulate and threaten/With terror as a weapon.” Apparently, principal lyricist and songwriter Martin Gore is no longer content to focus all his attention on the spiritual searching that has defined Depeche Mode’s music for more than 30 years. Over that time, few artists have so artfully portrayed the inner dialogue between redemption and indulgence. By the band’s 1990 breakout Violator, Gore had basically invented his own syntax for the human condition as a purgatorial struggle between sinful pleasures and a yearning for higher peace. And Gahan, with his ability to invest urgency, soul, and a feeling of debauched weariness into subjects like S&M and tortured love, has never failed to translate Gore’s restless malaise to the throngs who fill stadiums to connect with it. Gahan turns despair into sex appeal unlike no other. But this time, he’s tasked with looking up from his satin, regret-stained sheets and making us believe that an aging rock star really cares about civil unrest. Gahan delivers Gore’s state-of-world address for three songs in a row before going back to the band’s bread-and-butter obsessions. Later, though, on “Poorman”—which self-consciously references the spartan electronic gurgle of the Violator hit “Policy of Truth”—Gore and Gahan risk coming off as oblivious to the irony when they observe that “corporations get the breaks/Keeping almost everything they make” and ask, “When will it trickle down?” But Depeche Mode deliver anthems with such proficiency that sincerity barely matters. A song like “Where’s the Revolution” makes you feel like singing in response to today’s headlines. Depeche Mode still make universal, stadium-sized music that’s limber enough to fit through your bedroom doorframe, as if it had been conceived with your life in mind. In some respects, though, their consistency works against them. The sixth album since the departure of multi-instrumentalist/arranger Alan Wilder, Spirit sees Depeche Mode once again shuffling through the most quintessential components of their sound. On “Cover Me,” Gore’s haunting Lanois-esque guitar twang allows you to close your eyes and picture yourself under the Northern lights Gahan sings about. But aside from “Cover Me,” Spirit lacks the ambience of Depeche Mode’s most atmospheric material. If only producer/mixer James Ford (Florence and the Machine, Foals, Arctic Monkeys) had disheveled the sounds a bit, Spirit could have better asserted its place in Depeche Mode’s body of work. Instead, Ford—who is also one half of the electronic duo Simian Mobile Disco—mimics the vibe of the band’s iconic work with producer Flood. But even Flood didn’t imitate himself when he mixed the last DM album, 2013’s far more creatively resolute Delta Machine. Nevertheless, this is a band whose effortlessness can misguide you into thinking they’re not trying. Don’t be fooled. In the bridge of “Where’s the Revolution,” Gahan repeats the line “the train is coming, the train is coming... get on board.” You can draw inspiration from that lyric whether or not you take to the streets or petition your elected officials. Gore’s directive is less about activism and more about opening your heart so that it guides your conscience. For him, the term “spirit” has come to encompass politics, but it’s fueled by the same eros that’s driven the band’s music since day one. Which is why Spirit is so convincing in spite of its radical shift in tenor. For both the band and audience, that shift couldn’t have come at a better time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22997-spirit/,Columbia,2017.0
62,Laura Marling,Semper Femina,Folk/Country,7.7,March 14 2017,Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,"Laura Marling has used conversations surrounding her sixth album, Semper Femina, to disavow music of “innocent creativity”—the kind that’s “not pointed, not political,” she says. It’s an intuitive concept that sounds relatively novel coming from this folk songwriter. In the late 2000s, Marling emerged from London’s Communion scene, a coterie of authenticity fetishists who wore wounded hearts on tweed-jacket sleeves. Marling was herself embroiled in “innocent creativity,” but she released masterpieces of the form. Her identity evolved from romantic pragmatist to underdog sage to mystic troubadour; her voice became distant and supercilious, baring just enough soul to reassure you one was there. Radical honesty is now common among young songwriters, but Marling can harbor guilt, fear, arrogance, deceit, or triumph in a bottomless deadpan. It’s easy to invest in her evasion. Semper Femina—Latin for “Always a woman,” and taken from Virgil’s epic poem The Aeneid—is no revolutionary screed. But the album’s characters, who are all given female pronouns, tiptoe outside Marling’s world of heartbreak and personal redemption. There are signs of a broader project at play. With lyrics about “warning signs” that we’re conditioned to “ignore diligently,” “Next Time” appears to preach a maternal fondness for Mother Earth: “I can no longer close my eyes/While the world around me dies/At the hands/Of folks/Like me,” she trills. While her composure hasn’t wavered since 2010’s I Speak Because I Can, there’s something new in songs like “Next Time” and “Don’t Pass Me By.” Both remind me, in their reserve and understated melancholy, of mid-career Elliott Smith—a chaotic and vulnerable individual anchored by a preternatural understanding of melody, using compassion to navigate horror. As Semper Femina’s questions deepen, answers rarely materialize. The gorgeous “Always This Way” mourns a friendship cut short in unexplained circumstances. As sorrow triggers a bout of soul-searching, Marling confesses, “Twenty-five years and nothing to show for it/Nothing of any weight.” Over pastoral guitar twirls, the narrator soothes herself with a mantra, though not a satisfying one: “At least I can say/That my debts have been paid.” The conciliation feels a little flimsy. A songwriter as meticulous as Marling doesn’t need to innovate, but she’s most intriguing on songs like “Soothing,” when her cryptic lyrics snowball without scrambling for narrative closure. “Soothing” is also the record’s only really ambitious composition. Interlocked basslines quarrel under Marling’s magisterial tones. Its image of a “creepy conjurer” whose “hands are in the door” hangs elegantly unresolved. She sings her sendoff—“I banish you with love”—through luscious minor notes that, instead of sugarcoating the rejection, transfigure it. Banishment becomes liberation, a generous act. The philosophy develops on “Wild Fire”: “There no sweeter deed may be,” she sings, “Than to love something enough/To want to help it get free.” As is Marling’s trademark, the line blossoms as both a revelation—the narrator takes pleasure in her wisdom—and a reprimand to a clingy partner, someone unsuited to her passionate independence. Where Semper Femina might have sketched a feminist utopia, Marling instead uses her broad study of femininity to explore flawed, sometimes devastating relationships between women. The full Virgil quote—“A woman is an ever fickle and changeable thing”—could seem patronizing, but Marling quotes it fondly on “Nouel.” She is tirelessly nuanced, and the result is an album filled with beautiful, searching observations on the psychology of friendship and occasionally romance. “I think your mama’s kinda sad/And your papa’s kinda mean,” she sneers on “Wild Fire.” “I can take that all away/You can stop playing it out on me.” Marling proposes here that love is a defense against our parents’ pathologies—yet she acknowledges that the traits we inherit are stubborn, determined to sneak in and mangle beauty. It’s a fitting parallel to how Marling wrestles with, and masters, her ever more malleable folk idiom.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22949-semper-femina/,More Alarming,2017.0
63,Fleetwood Mac,Tango in the Night,Rock,8.7,March 11 2017,Brad Nelson,Contributor,"It started with “Sara.” The first two Fleetwood Mac albums to feature Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks—the self-titled album and Rumours—featured production typical of the pop-rock generated in Los Angeles in the ’70s. They were professional and pristine, exhibiting an instrumental and emotional warmth that was, in terms of the actual recording technique and the cerebral atmosphere of the people making the records, a product of isolation. On their next record, Tusk, Buckingham shifted the balance of Fleetwood Mac’s studio pop. He deliberately produced his songs so that they sounded trebly and makeshift—as if they were translated from brain to tape as quickly as possible—and produced Nicks’ and Christine McVie’s songs with a lush and carefully-sculpted dimensionality. “Sara,” a song Nicks wrote to a daughter she never had, is so gently shaped that every instrumental and vocal materializes in the song like vapor in the atmosphere. At the Blockbuster Music Awards in 2001, Nicks said that when she writes songs, she tries to “make little worlds” for the listener. Whether intentional or not, this sensibility invaded Buckingham’s production of the song; “Sara,” as it appears on Tusk, is its own world, a complete environment, a beach house built out of sighs. The follow-up to Tusk, 1982’s Mirage, was a kind reflexive scaling back; both Warner Bros. and Buckingham wanted to regenerate the success and the coherent atmosphere of Rumours. It didn’t take. The band members had already drifted too far from each other: Nicks sang country-western and synth-pop songs; Buckingham quoted Pachelbel’s Canon; McVie’s formal romanticism began to take on a crystalline quality; the production flowed in the direction of their individual fascinations. After a brief tour, the band went on hiatus. Nicks released two successful solo albums; McVie and Buckingham put out one each. In 1985, Buckingham had begun work on an additional solo album, when Mick Fleetwood suggested Buckingham fold his new songs into the more monolithic, more lucrative idea of a Fleetwood Mac record. The resulting album, Tango in the Night, is exactly that: a monolithic, lucrative idea of a Fleetwood Mac record. It was recorded over eighteen months between 1986 and 1987, mostly at Buckingham’s home studio in L.A. Buckingham devoted himself to the record, laboring intensely over its songs, its sounds, and the integrity of its design. Recording technology had advanced substantially since the early ’80s, and Buckingham found the methods by which he could determine the shape and temperature of a Fleetwood Mac song had expanded. “Most of the vocal parts were recorded track by track,” he told the *New York Times *in 1987. “The voices used in the textured vocal choirs were mostly mine. I used a Fairlight machine that samples real sounds and blends them orchestrally.” Out of these newly available materials, he could practically build an entire band, which was useful at the time. Mick Fleetwood was almost entirely consumed by his cocaine habit, and the band had been experiencing an internal drift for years. “Constructing such elaborate layering is a lot like painting a canvas and is best done in solitude,” Buckingham added. The album’s artwork, “Homage a Henri Rousseau” by Brett-Livingstone Strong, is so lush and romantic that it walks a fine line between formal elegance and kitsch, blending the terrestrial with the celestial. It’s an accurate illustration of Tango in the Night’s sound design, of the glitterings and humid shimmers that Buckingham placed in the songs. He made each track on Tango just as he produced “Sara”: less an arrangement of bass, guitar, drums, and vocals than a complete world, a living panorama. There’s a phenomenal wholeness to the recordings on Tango that seems like a superficial compensation for how deeply fragmented the band was at the time. After Nicks resurfaced from her cocaine addiction at the Betty Ford Clinic, she visited Buckingham’s studio for a few weeks. Three of her recordings figure into the finished Tango, only two of which were written by her. Her voice, invariably hoarse after years of cocaine abuse, often warps or fails the already incomplete material. She howls her way through “Seven Wonders,” a song written mostly by Sandy Stewart. (Nicks receives credit because she misheard “All the way down you held the line” as “All the way down to Emmiline”; for Nicks—and I don’t disagree—sometimes accident and authorship are indistinguishable.) For all of its bluster, the song is not only enhanced by the incidents of its arrangement but is the incidents of its arrangement; try to imagine the song without its synth hook and hear the rest of it evaporate. On “When I See You Again,” Nicks’ voice almost crumbles and shatters into atoms. “Stevie was the worst she’s ever been,” Buckingham told Uncut in 2013. “I didn’t recognize her...I had to pull performances out of words and lines and make parts that sounded like her that weren’t her.” Fittingly, each verse and chorus that Nicks sings sounds generated by a different uncanny assemblage of Stevie, among them one who sings in a kind of mutilated whisper. After the bridge, Nicks completely disappears. Buckingham finishes the song. Buckingham’s songs on *Tango *are less knotted than they were on Tusk and Mirage, newly permissive of space. The first single, Buckingham’s “Big Love,” is a song that inadvertently simulates the essential failure of the album. It is devoted to a totally abstracted and imaginary form of love, while Tango in the Night is devoted to a totally abstracted and imaginary form of Fleetwood Mac (neither of which could be assembled in reality). The song’s arrangement feels austere and detached, a byproduct of the narrator’s alienation, but it’s also decorated with overlapping, pointillist guitar phrases. Even the empty spaces on Tango feel like deliberately-wrought emptinesses—for instance, the airy synths that hover over the verses of McVie’s “Everywhere,” or Buckingham’s title track, which through its sense of space imparts the feeling of rowing through fog and mystery. Still, it’s McVie whose work is most realized by Buckingham’s impressionism. Her “Everywhere” is the best song on the record. Like “Big Love” it too is about encountering an idea too big to contain within oneself (love, again). But where “Big Love” apprehends it with icy suspicion, “Everywhere” responds with warmth, empathy, and buoyancy, describing a kind of devotion so deeply felt that it produces weightlessness in a person. Its incandescent texture is felt in almost any music that could be reasonably described as balearic. Elsewhere, “Isn’t It Midnight,” McVie’s co-write with Buckingham and her then-husband Eddy Quintela, seems an inversion of the values of “Everywhere,” a severe ’80s guitar rock song that gets consumed by a greater, more unnerving force by its chorus, as if it’s succumbing to a conspiratorial dread. “Do you remember the face of a pretty girl?” McVie sings, and Buckingham echoes her in an unfeeling monotone (“the face of a pretty girl”) while behind him synths chime in a moving constellation, UFOs pulsing in the dark. This is the essence of Tango in the Night: something falling apart but held together by an unearthly glow. More of a mirage than Mirage, it is an immaculate study in denial (its most enduring hit revolves around McVie asking someone to tell her “sweet little lies”). It’s a form of dreaming where you could touch the petals of a flower and feel something softer than the idea of softness. In this way, Tango seems to emerge less from Buckingham’s pure will and imagination than from a question that haunts art in general: How can one make the unreal real, and the real unreal? The remaster of Tango in the Night isn’t as topographically startling as last year’s Mirage, where new details seemed to rise out of the mix as if in a relief sculpture; it sounded good on CD in 1987. The reissue does sound warmer and brighter, and the instruments feel less digitally combined, which lifts background elements to the surface, like the seasick drift of the bass notes in “Caroline” and the coordinated staccato harmonies in the title track. The reissue also includes two discs of b-sides, demos, and extended remixes, several of which were previously unreleased. “Special Kind of Love” is described as a demo but sounds like a completely developed Buckingham song, gentle and simple, with every edge expressively filigreed; it could’ve been a potential second sequel to “You and I.” “Seven Wonders” appears in an earlier, more relaxed arrangement, with Lindsey’s guitar warmly swanning between the notes that would eventually be reconstructed in perfect digital isolation by a synthesizer. The demos also reveal the ways in which the songs could fold into and out of each other. On the “Tango in the Night” demo you can hear Buckingham, at the edge of every chorus, begin to invent the trembling choral part that opens “Caroline.” Nicks’ eventual solo track “Juliet” is present in two of its primordial forms—as the instrumental “Book of Miracles” (credited to both Buckingham and Nicks) and as a five-minute “run-through.” The run-through is especially curious, reducing “Book of Miracles” to a formulaic blues-rock over which Nicks’ voice produces a just-barely musical static, full of wobbles and distortions and exclamations. After the take she says, ecstatically, “I thought that was wonderful! I didn’t play! I did not play because I am so smart!” Nicks exhibits a strange, dissonant giddiness in this moment that isn’t present in any of the band member’s memories of the recording process. At the time, in his interview with the Times, Buckingham imaginatively described Tango in the Night as a restorative process. “This album is as much about healing our relationships as Rumours was about dissension and pain within the group,” he said. “The songs look back over a period of time that in retrospect seems almost dreamlike.” Twenty-six years later, Buckingham summarized the experience to Uncut in more severe terms: “When I was done with the record, I said, ‘Oh my God. That was the worst recording experience of my life.’” The jealousy and resentment he felt toward Nicks for the success she experienced in her solo career, and the prevailing feeling that his architectural work on the band’s records went unnoticed and unappreciated, had built to a flashpoint. Later in 1987, the band met up in anticipation of the promotional tour for Tango, for which they had already secured dates and signed contracts. At the meeting, Buckingham announced he was quitting the band. “I ﬂew off of the couch and across the room to seriously attack him,” Nicks told Classic Rock in 2013*.* “...I’m not real scary but I grabbed him which almost got me killed.” They spilled out of McVie’s house and into the street. Buckingham ran after Nicks and threw her up against a car. She “screamed horrible obscenities” at him, and he walked away, from the moment and the band. What’s left, after these harsh fragments of reality are swept away, is Tango in the Night: a remarkably complete album, a lavish garden growing out of negative space.

64,Flume,Skin Companion EP II,Electronic,5.8,February 28 2017,Elias Leight,Contributor,"The chasm that once separated mainstream electronic music and Top 40 has all but vanished. A few years ago, a captive festival goer might have been a producer's target audience; now the casual radio listener is the true prize. It's the difference between Skrillex, one of electronic music's most prominent artists, making “Bangarang,” a 2x-platinum-certified single from 2012 that didn't register with the average commuter, and forging “Where Are Ü Now?” a Justin Bieber number that guaranteed a primo spot in the great hall of pop. The Australian producer Flume (born Harley Edward Streten), built his career on a different type of accessibility. His songs can be easy to fall into, but they don't usually lasso listeners and ensnare them like an undeniable airwave triumph. Flume's 2012 self-titled debut, an oasis of lite house and loungeable hip-hop, offered refuge from the fusillade of trap beats sweeping through electronic music at the time. His second full-length, Skin, released four years later, set aside big-room lullabies to emphasize big-name collaborations, but there was a reticent quality to it. Flume worked with rappers on the declarative, bruising end of the spectrum—Vic Mensa, Vince Staples—but didn't make the kind of songs that really knocked you on your ass. He enlisted singers—Beck, Tove Lo—to create pop songs that were neither sugary nor off-kilter. He spoke of “mak[ing] experimental music accessible” and “fus[sing] the abrasive and the beautiful,” but seemed to sell both sides short. Flume patrols the same liminal zone on Skin Companion EP II. He leads with an uppercut, a track that's supposed to slug its way into your subconscious: “Enough” features rapping from the stolid veteran Pusha T, and the beat shovels a stream of noises—hollow wood tones, staticky crumbles—at the listener to stimulate a fight-or-flight response. But the song plays as an attempt to redo Lil Uzi Vert's “Uzi” and extract the magic from its alluring rumble. The central riffs of the two tracks are similar, as are the liquidating blots of bass and the drum breaks that “Uzi”-producer Charlie Heat also inserted into Kanye West's “All Day.” “Enough” never surges beyond emulation, any abrasiveness blunted by the feeling that this is an academic beat-making exercise. The rest of Skin Companion II veers away from the rough stuff to return to the modes Flume explored on his first album. “Depth Charge” will do fine as a bridge towards the more peaceful side of a live set. “Fantastic,” a collaboration with Dave Bayley of Glass Animals, is a colorless mid-tempo number with a clomping drum pattern designed to make heads bob. The most promising tune on the EP is “Weekend,” a reverie with extended beat-less portions. Though Moses Sumney's presence only registers as the song begins to wind down, his soothing tone is enough to summon the floating, comatose feeling. Flume doesn't want to be pinned down, and he's intent on proving his ability to make functional music for multiple scenarios. But malleability is only really powerful when it's accompanied by memorability, and the latter remains out of reach for Flume.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22965-flume-skin-companion-ep-ii/,"Mom & Pop,Future Classic",2017.0
65,Thundercat,Drunk,"Jazz,Pop/R&B",8.5,February 27 2017,Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,"Thundercat gives himself a pep talk at the beginning of Drunk: “Comb your beard, brush your teeth … beat your meat, go to sleep.” At least he’s in marginally better spirits these days. Following the death of his friend and collaborator Austin Peralta, his last two releases—2013’s Apocalypse and 2015’s The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam*—*explored the concept of extinction and what the spirit might endure when the body expires. On these records—along with Flying Lotus’ 2014 album You’re Dead!, where Thundercat contributed bass or vocals to many of its songs—the singer and preeminent bassist (born Stephen Bruner) tried to make sense of a devastating truth. Peralta was gone, and one day, he will be gone too. All this cosmic morbidity leaned on Thundercat’s music, which takes on many forms all at once: ’70s funk, R&B, punk with tinges of fusion. His art is undeniably black, yet the structures are loose enough to pull in all sorts of listeners. It speaks to those who love soul and ska equally, those who spazz just the same when George Duke or Bad Brains flash across the iPod. Thundercat is equal parts Nintendo generation, ’60s flower child, and hardcore skater bro. His live show is punk as hell; serene studio tracks are given loud, frenetic makeovers. On top of all that rests Thundercat’s smooth falsetto, a transcendent voice that can usher you into some sort of demise (“Descent Into Madness”), sing lovingly to his pet cat (“Tron Song”), or make drugs seem perfectly fine (“DMT Song,” “Oh Sheit It’s X.”). If Thundercat’s recent work focused on the uncertainty of death, Drunk confronts the challenge of just trying to live life. It’s a marathon through the mind of Bruner that uses his casually humorous and honest songwriting to detail that which is cool and that which sucks. Cool? Kenny Loggins and Dragon Ball Z wrist-slap bracelets. Sucks? Friend zones and the police state. Featuring Kendrick Lamar (“Walk on By”), Wiz Khalifa (“Drink Dat”) and Kamasi Washington (“Them Changes”) among others, Drunk plays like an anxious stoner album, the aural equivalent of late-night channel surfing. Its 23 tracks present a fluid narrative that begins on a somewhat bright note and gradually fades into darkness—a concept record that takes you through a bleary night of drinking, drugs, funk, and heartbreak with Thundercat himself. He is whimsical and somber, funny and meaningful, sometimes all at once. Each song hovers around the two-minute mark, defying those ‘70s fusion forebears whose tracks could drag on over dense harmonies and time signatures. Drunk hits all the melodic and emotional themes Thundercat aims for without belaboring the point. On openers “Rabbot Ho” and “Captain Stupido,” he comes off a bit goofy and red-eyed, leaving his wallet at the club after a night of partying. “Bus in These Streets,” which resembles the theme of 1980s children show “The Great Space Coaster,” uses a sarcastic nursery rhyme flow to chide our collective social media dependence (“Thank God for technology ‘cause where would we be if we couldn't tweet our thoughts,” Thundercat quips). “Jameel’s Space Ride,” a transitional song near the album’s end, uses a chiptune-inspired beat while he sings of the struggle between minorities and law enforcement: “I’m safe on my block, except for the cops/Will they attack, would it be ‘cause I’m black?” This, of course, is after he literally meows about how cool it must be to be a cat. All this oddball soul feels more anchored to Thundercat's humanity than his previous releases. We see him here as both a heartbroken insomniac, someone who looks at the world alongside Pharrell on “The Turn Down” and wonders if “everything we do is weak,” and a juvenile jazzbo who wants to “blow all [his] cash on anime.” Much like The Golden Age of Apocalypse* *and Apocalypse, which leapfrogged several different genres with dizzying results, he’s able to keep it all together, offering a puzzling ride that feels coherent despite its moving parts. Unlike his past work, which put his musicianship on great display, Drunk presents the defining picture of Thundercat as a person: quirky, political, thoughtful, weird—and sometimes drunk. These descriptors aren’t surprising if you follow him on Twitter, but here, Thundercat comes off like the guy who you can hit up at the bar and riff on pretty much anything. Given all he’s gone through personally, it’s an honor to hear Thundercat feeling like himself again.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22895-drunk/,Brainfeeder,2017.0
66,Funkadelic,"Live - Meadowbrook, Rochester, Michigan - 12th September 1971","Pop/R&B,Rock",8.0,January 14 2017,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Everybody with a stake in R&B knows the essence of live P-Funk: the costumes, the stagecraft, the dozen-plus musicians pushing freewheeling communication through the chaos. It’s known in the visual sense by the coming of the Mothership (an on-stage prop), and in recorded history on Parliament-helmed albums like 1977’s *Live (P.Funk Earth Tour) *and 1993’s Tear the Roof Off - 1974-1980. Anyone who’s seen footage of the band at their prime can’t overstate the greatness of their spectacle; their Halloween ’76 stop in Houston during their reputation-immortalizing if money-losing Earth Tour is the stuff that shifts tectonic plates. That history places the live-staged peak of the P-Funk operation at a mid ’70s origin point without the come-up background to go with it. Records of the band’s tour itinerary are surprisingly sparse in the years before the summer of 1975, too. But there was a stretch in 1971—including an extended stay in the UK—where their relentless barnstorming was starting to shape who they’d become en route to the double-LP sprawl of America Eats Its Young* *and funk-rock power hitters *Cosmic Slop *and Standing on the Verge of Getting It On. It wasn’t until 1996 that an official release on Funkadelic’s early label Westbound Records gave fans insight into what this year had in store for the band—and what they made of a well-regarded but turbulent moment in their history. Funkadelic Live: Meadowbrook 1971 was recorded when they were dealing with a personnel turnover that could’ve annihilated less-driven bands. Mere months after Maggot Brain* *came closer than anyone had ever gotten to picking up Jimi Hendrix’s psychedelic rock-soul mantle, Funkadelic would have to become an almost entirely different band. Rhythm guitarist Tawl Ross and on-and-off drummer Tiki Fulwood were both casualties having their separate issues handling drugs. Bassist Billy “Bass” Nelson would split from the group over financial compensation. And guitarist Eddie Hazel—the man who gave *Maggot Brain *its most searing moments, particularly the title track’s acid-rock lamentations—was one foot out the door en route to a time-monopolizing gig with the Temptations. Hazel and Nelson were still with the band as of September ’71, but the other two musicians needed substitutions—in both cases, on extra-short notice. That’s what makes the just-reissued *Meadowbrook 1971 *more than a mere happenstance snapshot of the band: it’s not simply P-Funk in their early phase, it’s P-Funk in transition. Originally given a soundboard recording without the band’s prior knowledge by Westbound label owner Armen Boladian, this September 12th gig on the outskirts of the band’s adopted Detroit home is a band piecing themselves together while discovering how to adapt. If that sounds like a sort of stop-start feeling-out process, it really is: new rhythm guitarist Harold Beane had been a Stax sideman most known for playing with Isaac Hayes, and freshly recruited drummer Tyrone Lampkin was the drummer for the Apollo Theater house band. Those are strong bonafides, but not entirely compatible with the acid-blotter blueprint of Funkadelic—and what’s more, they’d hardly even rehearsed before the show, if at all. That makes the first half of this set an exercise in barely controlled chaos. The 14-minute version of “Maggot Brain” is worth the recording’s existence alone: at this point, it’s still a recent composition, but it’s had enough time to mutate and expand into a spotlight showpiece that makes the full-band interplay as important as Hazel’s soloing. In other moments, the struggle to click-in makes the songs raucously janky at best and an actual “scrap this and start over” moment at worst. The metallic roar of “Alice in My Fantasies” fits the former, as though it’s just barely being held together through the sheer force of its raunch; it wanders with a predatory restlessness compared to the snap-tight *Standing on the Verge *version they’d drop three years later. But the false-start flailing around “I Call My Baby Pussycat” is mostly worth hearing for the way they actually change it in real time from its uptempo origins on Parliament's *Osmium *to the slower, slinkier variation they’d record for America Eats Its Young. George Clinton’s memoir rightfully touts Lampkin, the drummer, as a transformative force who “helped remake the band’s sound: louder, both looser and tighter,” but that night he was so intent on bursting out of the pocket and bringing the flash that Clinton had to make a point of half-apologizing for it. “Y’all got to kinda bear with us,” he tells the audience over a more boisterous variation of the “I’ll Bet You” drum beat than the band was presumably used to. “We got a new drummer here tonight... Tyrone. We’re gonna get it together anyhow, and gonna pee on your afro.” That last ad-lib wasn’t the only preview of the band they’d become by ’74; Lampkin flashes the elasticity here that would make the grooves of songs like “Cosmic Slop” and “Red Hot Mama” rock-solid no matter how many flourishes they’d get. That makes the selections from their ’70 debut—a snarl-of-joy rendition “Good Old Music” and a thunderstorm of a take on “I Got a Thing, You Got a Thing, Everybody’s Got a Thing”—reach the top of their potential for heaviness and wildness. In the end, it’s still Clinton who nails his preacher-turned-benevolent freak heights as Bernie Worrell acts as conductor/NASA ground control. Worrell held a vital role in keeping the fracturing group on point, dropping moments of dissonant counternotes with classically trained comedic timing, finding new ways to layer on distortion, and giving the other players riffs to improvise over in an enviable feedback loop. Parliaments oldie “All Your Goodies Are Gone (The Loser’s Seat)”—which was vocal-group soul in ’67, slinky funk in ’74, and a simmering acid-gospel 15-minute meditation on loss here—is the centerpiece that points to better things to come. In Rob Bowman’s must-read liner notes, Nelson reminisces that it was “like the instruments were playing us.” And even if the band was played within an inch of their life—the customary noise-freakout closer of “Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow” was cut short when a frustrated Nelson walked off the stage early—it’s hard to think of a moment where stress and strength intersected for P-Funk as fruitfully as it did here. Beane would be a key player in America Eats Its Young; Lampkin would be a percussive axis all the way through The Electric Spanking of War Babies. And by the time Hazel returned to make one of his biggest imprints on the band with his co-writes and solos on Standing on the Verge, he had guitarist Garry Shider and bassist Cordell “Boogie” Mosson to spar with. But before all that fell into place, this one night of fortuitously recorded havoc proved that it would take more than just a clash of styles to undo Funkadelic—in fact, that clash wound up making the funk even stronger.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22765-live-meadowbrook-rochester-michigan-12th-september-1971/,Tidal Waves,2017.0
67,Little Simz,Stillness in Wonderland,Rap,7.1,January 5 2017,Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,"Rapper Simbi Ajikawo, who records as Little Simz, is by all measures on an upward trajectory, with comparisons to iconoclasts like Lauryn Hill and praise from craft-minded virtuosos like Kendrick Lamar (the latter said Simz “might be the illest doing it now.”) By last year’s A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons, she’d experienced enough fame to be ambivalent about it—“the type of music that ain’t never gonna sell,” she rapped on “Wings.” But sell it did, enough for Simz’s next album to feature notably well-curated guests (though not Lamar; that collaboration will probably be pretty great whenever it inevitably happens). All of which served to set her up nicely for her new album, which is…a concept album based on Alice in Wonderland. The reference to the children’s story is a metaphor, naturally—“It’s about situations I’m still trying to get my head around, and places where I’m still trying to figure out who to trust, or who not to trust,” Little Simz told Vice in late 2016. (The exact situations are a bit amorphous—in other interviews she’s suggested the music industry, or escaping into art, or escapism in general.) But the conceit is the biggest problem—there’s a limit to how many takes can be drawn from a book of Victorian math jokes and accompanying film of Disneyfied drugginess. Alice is also more suited to satire or farce—Carroll’s original idea—than serious subjects or earnest introspection, the two modes of this album. “LMPD,” the first track, features a conscious Chronixx verse on Bob Marley, Black Lives Matter, and pineal glands, followed by a birdsong-flecked interlude featuring a spacey, pitch-shifted Cheshire Cat that evokes, depending on how charitable one is, reggae or a spa. A point is being made here, but perhaps not the intended one. On Stillness in Wonderland, befitting the title, Simz eschews the vivid psychedelia of peers like Janelle Monáe in favor of a muted, atmospheric approach. There are a couple of overt references—a “white rabbit” clip recurs throughout, and “King of Hearts” takes advantage of Alice’s most confrontational character to let Simz take off heads with Chip (still atoning for his kiddie-grime past as Chipmunk) and Ghetts. But for the most part, the wonder is in the arrangements. Much of Stillness features gorgeous production; touchstones might be early Martina Topley-Bird or last year’s KING album. But Stillness in Wonderland comes off more as a sparsely edited mixtape than a self-contained album: heavy on atmosphere, light on songs. Simz is remarkably prolific—this is her 11th release—and the album often feels fragmentary: tracks have five ideas in the space where one should be, promising experiments are shoehorned into a concept that perhaps might not have been there. On “Picture Perfect,” she plays Wonderland MC over jaunty brass; if only there was more to say besides “Wonderland is amazing, ain’t it?” Unusually for such an introspective album, the guest spots are welcome respite.“Poison Ivy” is a standout, a duet with longterm collaborator Tilla about a toxic-yet-compelling relationship, personified in a distorted, prickly guitar line tried to build an alluring soul duet atop. On “Shotgun,” there’s a gossamer hook by the always-welcome Syd, and then there’s Bibi Bourelly’s Rihanna-polished swagger on “Bad to the Bone.” It’s probably not coincidental that these two tracks are both more polished, with a radio-pop sheen totally out of place with the proggier stuff, and contain relatively few Alice references; Simz’s grappling with fame may well be a holding pattern. “I don’t want to be an overnight sensation/I’m tryin’ to make a record you can’t stop playin’,” SiR says on “One in Rotation”; there’s some false dichotomy shit going on here, and then the track cuts off, abruptly, as if snapped out of a dream.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22704-little-simz-stillness-in-wonderland/,Age 101,2016.0
68,Kacey Musgraves,A Very Kacey Christmas,Folk/Country,6.8,December 23 2016,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Kacey Musgraves continues to follow her arrow. In 2013, she built her reputation as an antidote to all that was said to be ailing country music: a traditionalist of unobtrusively twangy arrangements and a credible small-town Texas background, who was also slyly progressive in her down-home narratives. She cowrote Miranda Lambert’s deliciously vengeful mini-masterpiece “Mama’s Broken Heart” and released her own major-label debut, Same Trailer Different Park, which beat out Taylor Swift and the genre’s swaggering bros to win the Best Country Album Grammy. In 2015, she released Pageant Material; that record didn’t go big, it went home, eschewing radio-friendly hits to double down gorgeously on the gentle, folksy nuance of its predecessor. It opened at No. 1 but didn’t sell as well overall. Its follow-up, A Very Kacey Christmas, is yet another left turn from Musgraves. The third album is pretty early in an artist’s catalog for a holiday record, but she throws herself into this one as wholeheartedly as any proper LP. Her great epiphany is the short distance between rhinestones and aluminum trees, how what once was considered tacky and artificial can, with time, come to seem nostalgic and real. Musgraves’ album summons up the mid-’60s era nostalgia of A Charlie Brown Christmas, gliding naturally from her established Western-swing throwback aesthetic to kitschy exotica and vintage pop, with an expertly curated song selection that leans on campy novelties, classy standards, and a stocking’s worth of originals. Because our Christmas recordings pile up over the years, to be dusted off with the other decorations for a few weeks and then put back in their boxes, they may be one of the few types of albums many people still play in full. The sequencing of A Very Kacey Christmas exploits this advantage. Musgraves doesn’t rush her conceit, opening elegantly but conventionally with cello and pedal steel on “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” followed by a sleigh bells- and fiddle-accented “Let It Snow” with fellow Western swingers the Quebe Sisters. She shows her hand next on—of all things!—a polka-like cover of “Christmas Don’t Be Late,” a/k/a “The Chipmunk Song.” Replacing the cartoon characters’ irritating high-pitched voices with Musgraves’ crystalline effortlessness (and ditching the “ALVIN!!!” banter) renders this familiar bit of silliness deeply affecting; when Musgraves sings, “I still want a hula-hoop,” it’s with the poignancy of a adult yearning for all that she didn’t get in Christmases past. The other non-originals are cut from similarly elvin-green cloth, and they’re thoroughly enjoyable if less revelatory. Musgraves salvages “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas,” an oft-annoying mid-century gag record, gamely singing about not wanting “rhinoceroses-es.” She delivers an effectively restrained “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” with children chiming in with schoolyard backing vocals. Elsewhere, Musgraves lets the band’s instrumental prowess shine in a nimble, mariachi-flavored “Feliz Navidad.” Another song about various cultural ways of saying merry Christmas, the Hawaiian ditty “Mele Kalikimaka,” piles on the pedal steel, with the Quebe Sisters returning on close-knit harmonies. Ending with a woozy “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?”—capped by a snatch of “Auld Lang Syne” on piano, around a hearth of ambient chatter—feels obvious but fitting, like watching It’s a Wonderful Life on Christmas Eve. The four originals here vary in their success, “A Willie Nice Christmas,” if you’ll forgive a pun (and you’ll have to) is Musgraves’ weed-heavy holiday reunion with Willie Nelson, whose 1965 song “Are You Sure” she rebooted with him on Pageant Material. It is hardly essential, but notable for merely existing: Musgraves, who once sang, “I’m always higher than my hair,” name-checks “On the Road Again” and hopes “we’ll all stay higher than the star at the top of the tree,” as Nelson genially reminds us not to get so stressed. “Present Without a Bow,” which features Musgraves’ fellow classicist Leon Bridges, reaches for the holiday soulfulness of a song like Charles Brown’s “Please Come Home for Christmas,” but it doesn’t quite cohere. “Ribbons and Bows,” an upbeat hand-clapper in the Ronettes and Darlene Love mode, feels like a potential single, with “All I Want for Christmas Is You”-style lyrics channeled through Musgraves’ eye for what “the ladies [down] at the hair salon” will say. The real gift here is “Christmas Makes Me Cry,” a gut-punching acoustic ballad that Musgraves cowrote with Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally. While another country star with crossover ability, Dolly Parton, sang about keeping a stiff upper lip in her “Hard Candy Christmas,” Musgraves confides now that Nat King Cole, starry-eyed kids, and “seeing mom and dad get a little grayer” each year never fails to bring tears to her eyes. “Another year gone by/Just one more that I/I couldn't make it home,” she sings. For all her retro leanings, she wisely chooses to sing about contemporary people trying our damndest to be cheerful and loving in a particularly hectic—and, often, sad and heavy—time of year. Getting a little misty-eyed around the holidays? Now that’s a sentiment everyone can appreciate, in any era.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22705-a-very-kacey-christmas/,Mercury,2016.0
69,Post Malone,Stoney,Rap,4.5,December 15 2016,Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,"“White Iverson” is not a foundational brick; it is a sandcastle on a windy day with a high tide. No one who appreciated the breezy distraction of a radio song in 2015 wanted to hear nearly 70 minutes of Post Malone a year later. There are new one-hit wonders to enjoy; there are pop icons making important works; there’s probably a book somewhere worth reading. The song was charming, though: Through the haze of its production and Post Malone’s slurred delivery was a certain nostalgic desire and childlike wonder. Somehow, he hopped on a tour with Justin Bieber, and Universal subsidiary Republic Records believed that Stoney, a 68-minute long dirge, was the correct use of his talents. Even if you liked “White Iverson,” was there anyone who thought to themselves, I want to hear this guy’s story! What’s he all about? We need to know more!? For all of Stoney’s faults, its most damning one poisons the record at the source: This thing is completely soulless. It’s not for a lack of trying, however—Post Malone (real name: Austin Post) is presenting his most authentic self here, talking openly about relationships and taking too many drugs and drinking a little too much, amidst numerous “we made it” anthems. But he’s simply not a compelling artist; he doesn’t say anything new about these struggles, doesn’t frame them in a particularly memorable way, and has nothing to say now that he’s wrestled with his fame. What pushes Stoney past being merely forgettable and into a kind of cynical, punishing listen is the access to a bunch of producers and songwriters that came together behind the 21 year old to ensure a product so highly polished, and so clearly connect-the-dots, it robs him of any trace of charm. The album ends up doubling as a tacit acknowledgment that, hey, maybe this guy is just not that interesting. If it’s lowlights you want, Stoney’s got them: “I Fall Apart” brutally crashes the party, appearing right after “White Iverson.” The song is full of acoustic guitars, and features Post’s most obnoxious crutch: that weird little vibrato thing he does, a vain attempt to convey emotion. “I Fall Apart,” a self-lacerating breakup anthem, recalls Staind, working that same woe-is-me white boy pain with an unpleasant voice slathered all over it. “Go Flex” boasts a foot-stomp chorus and enough echo to sound exactly like the Lumineers or any other faceless “whoa-oh-oh” band; it’s as unholy as it sounds on paper. Stoney indulges in a few huge, expertly written, admittedly catchy hooks, but since Post doesn’t have a strong voice and is usually not saying much more than cliches, many of these faux-triumphant songs sound tailor-made for headphone commercials. See: “Congratulations,” with a “let me collect this check” Quavo appearance, or “Too Young,” a song that’s probably about a year old, and already in line to appear on the soundtrack for the next movie about a white boxer. To its credit, Stoney lets its best run of songs loose near the beginning of the album, after turgid opener “Broken Whiskey Glass.” “Big Lie” has a nice, booming DJ Mustard beat, sounding like something that could’ve been on ANTI or SremmLife 2, and one of the record’s strongest hooks, mostly because it plays into the same kind of sleepy-eyed charm of “White Iverson.” The baroque beats on songs like “Déjà Vu,” with Justin Bieber, and the Pharrell-assisted “Up There,” are begging for someone with a little more humor to show up, maybe Young Thug or any of the under-21 Atlanta guys. Still, Post Malone finds those grooves nicely, and they are the least burdensome songs on the record. I have a perhaps wishfully optimistic hope that Stoney could mark the end of a specific kind of rap album: the spiffy cash-in after the viral hit or mixtape run. Post feels like the flimsiest artist yet to get this treatment, and he got such an extravagant treatment at that. With a recent era of mixtape rappers on the decline, along with the steady hemorrhaging of album sales and bigger names taking bigger risks, it seems as if this type of hollow release could soon become as anachronistic as an $18 CD is today.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22686-stoney/,Republic,2016.0
70,J. Cole,4 Your Eyez Only,Rap,6.7,December 14 2016,Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,"Some time this March, a SWAT team descended on a home in a wooded, well-to-do North Carolina suburb. According to the producer Elite, helicopters vultured overhead as armed officers broke down the front door and raided the house, presumably acting on a tip from a neighbor who believed the occupants were manufacturing or selling drugs. There was no one home; masked and bulletproof-vested men kept pouring inside. Instead of a grow-op, officers found a basement littered with recording equipment, the bones of a creative hideout that had filled the community with little more than some errant blunt smoke. The house was J. Cole’s. It wasn’t the native North Carolinian’s only property holding: he’d previously purchased his childhood home, at 2014 Forest Hills Drive in Fayetteville, with plans to turn it into a rent-free safe haven for single mothers. On his last solo effort—which was named after the Fayetteville house—he rapped about his adolescent fantasies of white picket fences surrounded by trees, by quiet. The SWAT experience, recounted on “Neighbors,” the best song from Cole’s fourth album, 4 Your Eyez Only, is a grim perversion of those dreams, and it anchors a record that wrestles with the fragility of life and the importance of family ties. For long stretches, Eyez is a rumination on death. Cole frequently invokes other points of view, including that of his late friend James McMillan, Jr., who was killed at 22. The album is peppered with references to his murder, and a testimony from a young girl in Fayetteville, which appears at two points on “Ville Mentality,” echoes the reality faced by McMillan’s own daughter. Cole is himself a new father (“She’s Mine, Pt. 2” is about his wife and newborn child), and the title track, which closes the album with a missive for those young girls, is anchored by his personal anxieties, making for some of Cole’s most affecting writing to date. He also comes to life on “Immortal,” which sounds as if someone played Cole an unheard 2Pac song from the Makaveli sessions and then dared him to recreate it from memory. The song’s narrator feeds baggies through a burglar bar, watches Bic lighters wave under spoons, wakes up early to hit the Bowflex. It’s details like that last one that set “Immortal” apart from so much of Cole’s early work: you can see the speaker bathed in the artificial light of 3 a.m. infomercials, figuring he needs to put some weight on. He equivocates—“crime pays like a part-time job” is the sort of evocative, economical phrase that has eluded Cole so often in the past. And when he rattles off rhetorical questions (“Have you ever seen a nigga that was Black on the moon?/Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?/Have you ever seen a motherfucking ribbon in the sky?”) he’s working in a long tradition of rappers and writers knocking a grave present against against its opposite. To that end, at the song’s most defiant moment, Cole nods to his real life: “If they want a nigga, they gon’ have to send a SWAT team.” At its lowest points, 4 Your Eyez Only rehashes Cole’s worst tendencies. “No Role Modelz,” a breakout hit from 2014 Forest Hills Drive, tried to cast crass, regressive ideas about women as a moral struggle; “Deja Vu” is its mopey inverse, where Cole shouts over the music in a club to ask “Who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?/Tell me, is your house a home?” The song also lapses into some of the album’s laziest writing, like “On a scale from 1 to 10, that girl’s a hundred.” It’s like “Marvin’s Room” for guys who brought their high school letter jackets to college. (It’s worth noting that while “Deja Vu” and Bryson Tiller’s massive “Exchange” share a sample and, at points, have similar drum programming, producer Vinylz claims that he and Boi-1da produced “Deja Vu” before its beat was stolen and repurposed for the Tiller version.) Speaking of production, that’s the one area where Eyez falls far behind Forest Hills Drive. After “Deja Vu,” the album slips into a three-song lull of pale, ornate music—unfortunate because the songs grapple with the early death of parents, Cole’s love for his wife, and McMillan’s death, respectively. “Ville Mentality” in particular plays like an interlude, and it might in fact be better served with just its hook and the aforementioned words from a young woman. Eyez sorely misses the type of serrated edge given to Forest Hills Drive by tracks like “03’ Adolescence,” “G.O.M.D.,” or “Fire Squad.” For this record, Cole leans more heavily on his singing voice than ever before—a welcome change at points, but it pushes the middle section of Eyez onto the sleepier side of the ledger. Aside from the moments when he taps into something greater (“Immortal,” “Neighbors,” “4 Your Eyez Only”), Cole’s most marked improvement comes by sanding down the more grating parts of his style. There is less moralistic grandstanding, and no lines about bodily functions or leftover Italian food. In their place are references to airbrushed RIP shirts and private prison shareholders. That said, a dutiful focus on the album’s central storyline means there aren’t big swings or long tangents in any direction, and aside from that trio of great tracks, Cole seldom sounds like he’s leaving it all out on the field. But Eyez often feels like a natural extension from the more overtly political tone of Cole’s public comments since his trip to Ferguson in August of 2014. This isn’t a protest record in the acute sense, but it’s unavoidably the product of the types of oppression that beckon SWAT teams into suburban homes on nothing but hearsay. In that vein, the most quietly radical decision Cole makes here is following “Neighbors” with a song called “Foldin’ Clothes,” where he and his wife shirk the outside world for Netflix and almond milk. That domestic stillness—stillness that might be interrupted at any moment by helicopters or an evening news report—is fragile, and that fragility is its own devastating statement.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22696-4-your-eyez-only/,"Roc Nation,Dreamville",2016.0
71,Pink Floyd,The Early Years 1965-1972,Rock,8.8,December 14 2016,Jesse Jarnow,Contributor,"“Today’s underground may be the answer to tomorrow’s leisure,” intones an earnest British newscaster, narrating film of London’s U.F.O. Club circa January 1967 while its house band, Pink Floyd, jams amid the flashing lights. And darned if he wasn’t right: the black-and-white segment is now found on the massive new $550, 11-CD/9-DVD/8 Blu-Ray box set, Pink Floyd: The Early Years, 1965–1972. With over 27 hours of material, the package overflows with replica 45 rpm singles, gig flyers, posters, tickets, sheet music, and more, and the ark-like box should provide serious leisure-time satisfaction for both longtime Floyd freaks and aspiring heads alike. The Early Years tells the remarkable story of Pink Floyd’s career up through the moment they became part of yesterday’s underground and today’s mainstream, stopping just before the writing and recording of 1973’s Dark Side of the Moon. Charting the band’s progression from the wig-flipping baroque psychedelia of Syd Barrett’s songwriting through their wooliest jams and into the new space beyond, The Early Years doesn’t follow a straight path. It shows an astonishing capacity to turn corners and evolve, a long arc that might give hope to every band jamming away in its practice space in search of a voice. Beginning as a blues combo with the perfectly British drug-punning name the Tea Set (“tea” being slang for weed, maaaan), the band rechristened themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound by the time of the 1965 demo sessions that open the box’s first disc. Though not particularly competent or interesting R&B players, as demonstrated by their cover of Slim Harpo’s “I’m a King Bee” just as much as an untitled 1968 “Blues Jam” on a later disc, it’s fascinating to hear Barrett’s already distinctly bent rhythm guitar as filtered through the Bo Diddley beat of “Double O Bo.” Unheard before being released in 2015 as a double 7"" for Record Store Day, the 1965 sessions also highlight the first fruits of Barrett’s songwriting, the playfulness of “Butterfly” displaying the stylist and singer he already was. “Along with Anthony Newley, he was the first guy I’d heard to sing pop or rock with a British accent,” David Bowie would say of Barrett, a madcap permission-granter for a new generation of British musicians less beholden to imitating their American heroes. Leaving the band in a haze of mental health issues in early 1968, Barrett’s legend would loom over the quartet for years. On the set’s volume from that year, titled Germin/Ation, Floyd’s earliest songwriting without their former leader sounds like a drab imitation, with keyboardist Rick Wright’s “It Would Be So Nice” anticipating the B-list ’60s twee-pop parodied by Spinal Tap on “Cups and Cakes.” Instead, Floyd would start to find themselves in the deep space of their early jam centerpiece, “Interstellar Overdrive,” the nearly 10-minute freak-out that closed their 1967 debut and whose descending chromatic riff dropped them into the beyond. With seven versions on the set, including a devastatingly weird DVD/Blu Ray-only 1969 take of the later slower arrangement featuring Frank Zappa on guitar, the song would provide the first portal for the band’s furthest explorations. (One of the set’s few big bummers is that it doesn’t offer audio-only downloads of the live performances featured on the visual discs.) For fans of Floyd’s experimental tendencies, The Early Years offers enormous fun, beginning with a never-bootlegged soundtrack session. Recorded by the Barrett-era lineup in October 1967 to accompany an abstract film by John Latham, the nine takes are all light show swirl, star-splatter guitar, and primitively convincing free drumming by Nick Mason. And though, later on, Barrett replacement David Gilmour would rightly become known as a guitar hero, his playing throughout The Early Years is judicious when it comes to solos. Wailing some tasty space-blues on “Careful With That Axe, Eugene” during a jam-heavy August 1969 set from Amsterdam and a blistering “Atom Heart Mother” from Montreux ’70, Gilmour just as often fits into the band’s tapestry of gentle cymbal taps and moody keyboard filigrees. Where their American countercultural cousins in the Grateful Dead found mind-manifesting wonder in their musical interpretation of cosmic space, the Floyd more often channeled the cold vacuum and existential tedium, perhaps a reflection of the post-psychedelic fate of Barrett. “Moonhead,” their soundtrack to the Moon landing performed live on BBC TV and captured on Bonus Continu*/Ation*, is a deliberate controlled float, more proto-symphonic than hippie jam. It’s this questioning sadness that the band starts to tap into during their 1969 sessions, the first mournful strains that would find their fullest expression on Dark Side of the Moon. The watershed event comes when Waters’ “Cymbaline” and “Green is the Colour” and Gilmour’s “The Narrow Way” all first turn up on the box, part of a May 1969 BBC recording for John Peel; it’s one of seven sessions for the DJ, all classic bootlegs in their own right. In slightly different and renamed form, all three songs play a part in one of the box’s most enticing if imperfect pieces: a complete live recording of The Journey and The Man, the band’s first attempt at conceptual suites of music, performed as two halves of a show on several occasions in 1969. Though fans have attempted to reconstruct the performances as though it were a lost album, the actual product includes reworked existing pieces, going back as far as “Pow. R Toc H.,” from their 1967 debut, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, here becoming “The Pink Jungle.” Performed with onstage happenings and fourth-wall-breaking intrusions, the music is a fascinating forerunner to Floyd’s more successful theatrics. With sci-fi noir atmospherics (“The Labyrinths of Auximines”), live musique concrète featuring band-members sawing through wood (“Work”), overblown drum solos in disguise (“Doing It”), as well as genetic connections to the Anglophonic fun of the Syd era (Waters’ “Afternoon,” collected as “Biding My Time” on 1971’s Relics), the two suites are first drafts. That the band scrapped them and moved along to the next ambitious projects in the queue is yet another testament to their developing editing skills. As career periods go, the seven years of Pink Floyd’s Early Years don’t exactly match other intense eras of classic rock creativity, like Bob Dylan from 1961 to 1968 or the Beatles from 1962 to 1969. But this set illustrates something about both Pink Floyd’s own path and the rewards of resilience. While remembered for their outsized onstage gestures like inflatable pigs and the disassembly of a giant wall, the real revelation of The Early Years is to hear exactly how slowly and modestly Pink Floyd came into themselves; despite the scale of their ambition, the box feels less a blueprint than a scale model. While Barrett’s contributions remain singular, the development of the band over these years wasn’t so much genius than inspired workmanship, not all of it successful. David Gilmour’s “Fat Old Sun,” appearing first on a July 1970 Peel session, is less compelling in its 15-minute jammed-out incarnation the following year. “Embryo,” though, develops from a three-minute post-Barrett psych-folk bauble on a 1968 BBC session to a fully realized 10-minute prog arrangement by 1971, the band’s restlessness apparent and worthwhile. There’s plenty to gnaw on, from Barrett’s whimsy to the formless countercultural yearning of the middle years to the emergence of Waters and Gilmour as songwriters to the brilliant suite-making of 1971’s “Echoes.” While the band would shatter amid acrimonious lawsuits a decade after this set’s conclusion, the music is the sound of musicians working in concert towards an unseen and unknown goal. In the modern age of oversized vault-clearing and copyright-protecting box sets, there is something resoundingly human about The Early Years, which only makes the achievements more extraordinary. Concluding with a new mix of 1972’s Obscured by Clouds (excluding bonus material), one can hear all the pieces of their more iconic future albums clicking into place and the sound of space closing around them into something more fixed. But that’s the topic of another box set.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22663-the-early-years-1965-1972/,Legacy,2016.0
72,Flume,Skin Companion EP I,Electronic,6.6,December 14 2016,Nathan Reese,Contributor,"The stakes were high for Harley Edward Streten. In 2012, the Sydney, Australia-based producer, who records as Flume, released his self-titled album as EDM was reaching peak cultural saturation. Flume’s beat-oriented sound—experimental enough for comparisons to LA’s Brainfeeder scene, pop enough to best One Direction in the charts—was so quick to catch fire that even Streten seemed shocked by his ascendency. “There was a lot of hype,” he told Complex recently. “It exploded in Australia first and then the rest of the world was coming on board and it was quite a process.” This was only one year after his first live show, and Flume—then 21—had a legitimate hit album and the attention of music’s biggest names. Over the next 36 months he would remix Lorde, Disclosure, Sam Smith, and Arcade Fire. So, when it came time for to drop Skin, the burden was heavy to prove he was more than just the flavor of the moment. “I struggled with the pressure of having the successful record after the first record,” he said. “Second album syndrome. I’m living proof; it’s very real.” Streten’s way of dealing with astronomical expectations, as it turned out, were equally large ambitions: if Flume was a beat maker flirting with pop, *Skin *was a pop record with an experimental sense of rhythm. The sixteen-track album was stacked with legacy giants and alt-pop darlings, among them: Beck, Raekwon, Vince Staples, Little Dragon, AlunaGeorge, MNDR, and Vic Mensa. Some songs, like “Tiny Cities,” were successes. (Beck recast as a future-pop Beach Boy was an unexpected win.) More often, however, the features roster seemed a cagey distraction to Flume’s more left-field impulses. Skin Companion 1, is billed as the first EP, presumably in a series, that will feature music recorded from the same sessions that produced Skin. But while that album emerged from a sous-vide of industry hype, its companion isn’t nearly as overdone. Of the EP’s four tracks, only one, “Trust,” features a guest vocalist—the Preatures’ Isabella Manfredi—and she’s here because she makes sense for the song, not to generate buzz. (The Preatures, like Flume, are New South Wales natives.) The result is a glitchy and glossy R&B-inflected tune, somewhere between CHVRCHES and Natasha Kmeto, with all the punch of Skin standout single, “Never Be Like You.” The remainder of the album features more airy successes, similar to the shorter cuts on Skin. “V” rattles and clatters for under three minutes, blending organic percussion, disembodied vocals, and elastic synths; the sound is surreal and meditative, like playing pick-up-sticks in a zen garden might be. The EP’s most straightforward track, “Heater,” is restrained compared to the Glastonbury-ready productions on Skin. It could work as a festival experience—there’s a mellow mid-section drop—but the compressed synths invite enthusiastic head nods, not dancing. The EP closes with “Quirk.” Etherial and unstructured, a soulful vocal sample drifts atop percussion that never quite reaches Arca-levels of avant-garde. Flume's album art, which looks like weaponized, net-art ikebana, does an accurate job of capturing a sound that is as biological as it is mechanical. Had something like *Skin Companion 1 *came out before the release of Flume’s sophomore effort, fans would probably be questioning Streten’s muscle: these are subtle productions, more Gold Panda than SBTRKT. But now that we’ve seen Flume’s version of laser-focused hit making, it’s nice to him in a painterly, if insubstantial mode. After holding his breath for four years, it was time for Flume to exhale.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22687-skin-companion-ep-i/,Mom & Pop,2016.0
73,Soundgarden,Badmotorfinger,Rock,8.3,December 8 2016,Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,"With their detuned guitars, plodding tempos, permanently downcast expressions, and hardware-store dress code, Soundgarden looked every bit the “grunge” part, at least on first glance. If your first introduction came, for instance, via the image of frontman Chris Cornell baring his chest on a dimly lit soundstage in the video for “Loud Love,” you could easily mistake Soundgarden for a bunch of oafs wading in the same tarpit where the brontosaur remains of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin lay fossilized. In fact, at points on their 1989 sophomore album/major-label debut Louder Than Love, Soundgarden came off as a ham-fisted Zep/Sabbath mashup. Clearly, the band underwent a period of profound growth sometime prior to recording Badmotorfinger, the 1991 follow-up that captures the band clicking on all cylinders. In its breadth and execution, Badmotorfinger dramatically surpasses the band's previous work. (Just don’t judge by the even more oafish video for leadoff single “Outshined”). The album also sustains a level of focus, cohesion, and intensity that the band’s later, more varied albums lack. It is also the moment where Soundgarden’s unique four-way interplay comes into alignment in earnest, along with their collective sense of songcraft and ability to create atmosphere. In the oversized coffee table booklet that accompanies the seven-disc “super deluxe” version of this reissue, three dozen musicians offer their recollections, including Henry Rollins, Les Claypool, Vernon Reid, Kirk Hammett, Buzz Osborne, Dale Crover, Krist Novoselic, Tom Morello, Steve Von Till, etc, etc. High praise even comes from ancestral giants like Zeppelin leader Jimmy Page, Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, and Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson. The mental image of Lifeson cranking Badmotorfinger with his kids, as suggested by his notes, is probably the most endearing. Sadly, though, Mudhoney’s Mark Arm doesn't re-tell the story of how, on hearing the final mix for the first time, he sent the band a postcard with the disparaging note: “Fuck, you guys sound like Rush now.” Though Louder Than Love cemented the band’s appeal with metal audiences, Soundgarden had first struck a national chord among college radio deejays who were keyed-in on the band’s underground pedigree. After working with the iconic independent label Sup Pop on their debut EP Screaming Life in 1987, Soundgarden initially turned down major label offers to release their debut full-length, 1988’s Ultramega OK, on SST, the venerated indie imprint founded by Black Flag’s Greg Ginn. Those two releases in particular reflected the band’s affinity for underground/post-punk acts like Hüsker Dü, Bad Brains, and Sonic Youth. In the new Badmotorfinger liners, Jello Biafra likens Soundgarden to a cross between Zeppelin and Killing Joke. But it’s not like the post-punk influences jump out at you on Badmotorfinger. That’s because, by that point, Chris Cornell and lead guitarist Kim Thayil had combined their individual guitar approaches into a complex latticework that remains somewhat inscrutable even as it grips you. For every Badmotorfinger passage that makes you want to bust into a fit of air guitar—the unevenly metered, Sherman tank trudge that closes “Rusty Cage,” the blues-metal crunch of “Drawing Flies,” the quasi-thrash gallop of “Jesus Christ Pose,” etc.—the music is rife with ten times as many intangibles. To choose just one, then there’s the high-end ambient buzz that permeates the album from start to finish, imbuing it with a static charge not unlike the electricity one feels in the air when entire sky darkens under a massive storm cloud. Indeed, much of Badmotorfinger’s power resides in its suggestion of a violence that rarely erupts and offers little catharsis when it does. The best example can be found on “Slaves and Bulldozers,” a seething seven-minute crawl where Thayil spends most of the time strangulating his guitar strings for spasms of noise that almost seem to emanate from an inhuman source. If you've ever been rendered speechless by the sight of the ocean, stars, volcanic activity—anything that suddenly makes you aware of your minuscule place in the order of life—Thayil’s “leads” (if they can even be called that) surge with the same coldly neutral ferocity. Meanwhile, even when Cornell unleashes his famous throat-scraping roar on the line “now I know why you’ve been shaking,” the enormity of the music feels choked back rather than triumphant. In sharp contrast to other heavy music—which is mostly designed to take frustration out on external targets—Soundgarden's signature rumble doesn’t give you an athletic rush. All of that gnashing turmoil on “Slaves and Bulldozers” actually points inward, collecting in your muscle tissue as a kind of seismic potential energy. And when the entire band pulls back for Cornell to switch to a bluesy murmur before the song’s wailing climax, Soundgarden show a command of dynamics they simply hadn’t been capable of before. As you listen more closely, it becomes increasingly apparent that none of the songs lend themselves to primary hues like “angry,” “sad,” or even “rocking.” In its most rousing moments, Badmotorfinger is anchored by a pensiveness that fosters daydreaming as much if not more than it gives you reason to bang your head. Fittingly, the album’s lyrics venture well beyond heavy rock’s typical purview: Where other bands would choose to emote more directly from the gut (or elsewhere), Soundgarden temper the attack of the music with painterly images Cornell delivers with Beatnik flair. On “Room a Thousand Years Wide,” Thayil’s refrain of “tomorrow begat tomorrow” extends the song’s ambiguously woebegone perspective over timeless eons. And though bassist Ben Shepherd’s “Somewhere” doesn’t quite disclose itself as a love song, the sense of romance is undeniable in lines like “From the likes of her/To the time of me/Like the moon to earth/Or the sky to sea./Only we’re no longer/Allowed to be.” Badmotorfinger is also anchored by drummer Matt Cameron’s inimitable way of dragging the beat back while also smoothing-out Cornell and Thayil’s preference for uneven time signatures. Even on punkish uptempo bangers like “Rusty Cage” and “Face Pollution,” Soundgarden never simply barrel forward, switching gears on a dime and moving sideways with the dexterity of a prog act. (Hence Mark Arm’s Rush comparison.) With all four members stretching more than ever before, at several points the music verges on the transportive, head-trip vibe of space rock or psychedelia. On the dreamlike “Searching with My Good Eye Closed” swirls of guitar twine around Cornell’s voice, heavily draped in reverb to give it the weight of a mystical presence speaking through clouds. When playing together in a room, the band tended to lumber through the song—evidenced painfully by the bonus concert and demo versions included in the deluxe package. Speaking of which: The studio outtakes here may be interesting from a forensic point of view, but they’re basically glorified demos that lack the agility of the finished songs. And while the version of “Black Rain”—with lyrics that would later be refitted for the Superunknown hit “Fell on Black Days”—works as a curio, the song selection could have gone deeper to include the early version of “No Attention,” a tune the band attempted during the Badmotorfinger sessions before settling on a later version for 1996’s Down on the Upside. In its definitive form, though, “Searching with My Good Eye Closed” is the most dramatic example of Soundgarden’s ability to touch the otherworldly. If you listen very closely to the fade out, you can hear the last wisp of Cornell’s voice trailing off: It’s barely audible and lasts for just half a second before it's smothered out of the frame by the leaden trudge of “Room a Thousand Years Wide.” The same thing essentially happened with the band’s career two years later, when Soundgarden went on to sell five million and became alterna-rock household names with their next album, 1994’s Superunknown. Much like when a director known for working in black and white switches to color, the obvious change in palette is initially what dazzles about Superunknown. But as both albums have aged, you could make a case that Soundgarden actually accomplished more with the comparatively limited shading of Badmotorfinger. Listening back now it’s an album that would have sounded fresh and vital released at any time over the past quarter century. The band didn’t do the music any favors with that dreadfully dated “Outshined” video, but it doesn’t take long for Badmotorfinger to reveal itself as something far greater than a relic of its time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22631-badmotorfinger/,"A&M,UME,A&M,UME",1991.0
74,The Rolling Stones,Blue & Lonesome,Rock,6.9,December 7 2016,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"The Rolling Stones have been the World’s Greatest Rock ‘n’ Roll Band__™__ for so long that, over the past three decades, they haven’t had to worry about being an especially good one. Since the mid-’80s, they’ve been releasing forgettable records at increasingly protracted intervals, all while their ever-extravagant world tours have taken on the feel of a traveling Hard Rock Café resort—a glitzy simulacrum of a rock’n’roll show catering to those who can afford to experience it. Fittingly, earlier this year the band went from being a proverbial museum piece to becoming an actual one. The knock on the Stones isn’t that they’re too old to play a young man’s game—even at 73, Mick Jagger can still run laps around performers a third his age—but that aging has brought no greater depth or texture to their music. What the Stones have lost over the years is not their capacity for raunchy rock’n’roll, but their ability to invest it with purpose and meaning. Jagger and Keith Richards used to be among the best (and most underrated) lyricists in rock; their last album was called A Bigger Bang and kicked off with a tune that included a “cock” pun in the opening verse. However, the Stones’ new album is as introspective as we can expect them to get in 2016—even if it they are playing songs that are nearly as old as they are. Blue & Lonesome is a covers collection that pays tribute to the post-war Chicago blues that first got the Stones rolling and inspired their very name. And since then, the blues have served as the foundation the band can dig into whenever their sound threatens to turn too au courant, whether they were reacting to the hippy-dippy whimsy of Their Satanic Majesties Request with the sleazy acoustic struts of Beggars Banquet, or devoting a side of Black and Blue-era concert document Love You Live to Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon worship. But Blue & Lonesome represents more than just a back-to-basics mission, It’s the most honest music the Stones have released in years—not because the source material confers it with the patina of authenticity, but because the entire blues-covers concept is a tacit admission that they don’t really give a shit about being a contemporary concern anymore, so they’re just going to do something that feels good. (The record was reportedly spawned as a warm-up exercise for a postponed album of new material.) And now that the band are older than Muddy Waters or Howlin’ Wolf ever lived to be, they can fully inhabit the grizzled-bluesman archetype to which they've always aspired, and exude a genuine get-offa-my-lawn imperviousness to the modern world. Blue & Lonesome was bashed out in three days, and for the first time in eons, the Stones sound like a band playing together in the same room rather than one that travels on separate jets. Jagger is, naturally the star of the show—but not in his usual vampish ways. Whether he’s embodying the down-on-his-knees despair of Memphis Slim’s title track or playfully assuming the role of sad-sack cuckold on Little Johnny Taylor’s “Everybody Knows About My Good Thing,” his ageless voice sounds like it’s emanating from the middle of the band scrum rather than the lip of a catwalk. And while Chicago blues may have introduced the concept of jamming and guitar gods to the rock lexicon, Richards and Ronnie Wood’s grinding interplay ultimately plays a supporting role to Jagger’s harmonica honks, which cut through these songs like a rusty hacksaw with “Midnight Rambler”-worthy gusto. But as much as Blue & Lonesome plays it raw, it’s not all that raucous—the energy here is less rip-this-joint than rocking-chair steady. On paper, the idea of the Stones running roughshod over a set of classic blues tunes seems like a long-suffering fan’s dream. (The “best Stones album since Some Girls!” headlines practically write themselves.) However, what made the Stones the Stones wasn’t their purism—it was the sacrilegious impulse to corrupt their influences with their own singular swagger. But Blue & Lonesome is more about adhering to tradition than encouraging sedition. The Stones may be drinking from their fountain of youth here, but they’re content to just savor it rather than spit it back in our faces. On their best blues covers—Beggars Banquets’ “Prodigal Son,” Sticky Fingers’ “You Gotta Move,” Exile on Main Street’s “Shake Your Hips”—the Stones handled the songs like Ouija boards; they were less about paying homage to their heroes than channeling their sinister essence. Blue & Lonesome has flashes of that insidious inspiration: On the revved-up run through Howlin’ Wolf’s “Commit a Crime,” Jagger’s vocal oozes with implied violence overtop a repetitive, trance-inducing riff that rings like a police siren; on Little Walter’s “Hate to See You Go,” his pained baby-please-don’t-go pleas climax with an extended harmonica drone that threatens to swallow the song whole. But for the most part, Blue & Lonesome doesn’t aspire to be anything more than a good-time frolic among old pals (Eric Clapton cameos included), with the interchangeable, upbeat takes on Buddy Johnson’s “Just Your Fool” and Eddie Taylor’s “Ride ‘Em on Down” more conducive to knee-tapping in a seated supper club than tearing the roof off a juke joint. For an album rife with tales of heartache, duplicity, and death threats, it’s positively brimming with bonhomie. And, hey, given all the shit-talking Keith did at Mick’s expense in his autobiography, Life, that audible camaraderie is something of a minor miracle in and of itself.  On its own modest terms, Blue & Lonesome offers promising proof the Stones can still be a band instead of a brand.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22653-blue-lonesome/,Polydor,2016.0
75,Childish Gambino,"“Awaken, My Love!”",Rap,7.2,December 6 2016,Matthew Strauss,Associate Editor,"By now, the world knows who Donald Glover is. From “Community” to the sharp and universally beloved “Atlanta” to his forthcoming Star Wars role, he’s carved out his persona; he’s likable, sensitive, and observant, the self-aware everyman. But Childish Gambino has always been harder to pin down. Since emerging with throwaway mixtapes under that alias, Glover has released two highly self-reflexive rap full-lengths, a Southern rap EP and a straight pop EP, and hosted a mysterious, cell phone-free festival. The unifying thread connecting all of this has sometimes been hard to spot. His recently released “Awaken, My Love!” is his hardest left turn yet, ditching rap wholesale in favor of funk worship, and the result is his most enjoyable project to date. In paying homage to heroes, he even hits upon some of the genuine emotional connection that has often been missing from his music. The album’s production is majestic, aiming squarely for the cosmos depicted on its striking cover artwork. Like the cosmic soul it emulates, the atmosphere is lush, full of period ambiance worthy of a high-end television set. The album’s first track and lead single, “Me and Your Mama,” is a satisfying slow burn that shows off Glover’s impressive falsetto. Its imagery (“This is the end of us/Sleeping with the moon and the stars”) might be vapid, but the intensity of Glover’s singing compensates, as does the ripping electric guitar. The tracks are embellished with intricate details throughout, like the delicate xylophone on “Terrified.” “Redbone” builds from a slow jam into a peak of futuristic guitar and forceful staccato piano chords. It’s a love song, which has always been Glover’s forte, whether on Because the Internet’s “3005,” “Telegraph Ave,” or Camp’s “L.E.S.” The same goes for the open-hearted “Baby Boy,” possibly inspired by the birth of his son. These songs dig into something that feels unique to Glover’s heart, not just his record collection. Too much of the rest, though, simply nods to sentiment without producing any. On “Have Some Love,” he limply advises the audience to “really love one another.” The song called “Riot” isn’t exactly riotous: He screams a little, but only for the sake of fulfilling a pre-ordained funk yelp quota—nothing in the song seems to have moved him to shrieking. There are also a few indistinguishable tracks that feel like funk retreads; “Have Some Love” sounds uncomfortably close to “Can You Get to That” from Funkadelic’s Maggot Brain. “California,” a cringey tropical parody complete with fake patois, sticks out for the wrong reasons. It sounds like “Kokomo” for the “Hotline Bling” era, or maybe Ween covering Sublime’s “Caress Me Down,” and its inclusion is entirely baffling, considering the sonic cohesion of the rest of the project. Donald Glover’s greatest talents remain his tragicomic touch as a screenwriter and his ease with performance. He’s skilled enough to figure out how to excel at something, and, for the most part, look like he knows what he’s doing. As a rapper, he almost sounded the part: Take a step back, and there he was, rapping fast, switching up flows, delivering (too many) punchlines. But zoom in, and it didn’t really click. Rarely did he make a song about anything, and those zingers were plain obnoxious. (“Fandango my mandingo, we should do a movie” from a 2012 track with Danny Brown, for example.) That same on-paper ability is what makes “Awaken, My Love!” a well-executed project: He has clearly absorbed a great deal of musical history, as the album nods to Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone, Rick James, Prince, and more. There are times, however, when that nodding feels more like mimicry than anything else. Maybe he’ll figure out how to smuggle Donald Glover’s heart into Childish Gambino’s brain eventually, but if he hasn’t figured out what he wants out of Childish Gambino yet, it’s increasingly rewarding watching him try.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22671-awaken-my-love/,Glassnote,2016.0
76,John Legend,Darkness and Light,Pop/R&B,7.0,December 5 2016,Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,"John Legend doesn’t waste time getting to the point of Darkness and Light, his fifth solo album. On “I Know Better,” the record’s gospel-infused opener, the singer refutes the celebrity he’s acquired to date: “Legend is just a name, I know better than to be so proud/I won’t drink in all this fame/Or take more love than I’m allowed.” At this stage of his career—which includes 10 Grammy awards, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award for Best Original Song—Legend could’ve continued to play it safe; his mix of secular and spiritual soul has taken him far over the years. But on Darkness and Light, Legend pushes beyond his comfort zone for something a bit more ambitious. With its meditative and ingratiating songwriting, this is unmistakably a John Legend album, yet there’s a renewed sense of peace and even a sad wisdom that distinguishes it. He sings lovingly of his infant daughter, Luna, wondering who she will become as she grows older. He ponders the different sides of love, and the raw emotions they evoke. He's made a love record about navigating the bleak world and finding happiness in dark times. For Darkness and Light, Legend reached out to Blake Mills after hearing what the producer did for Alabama Shakes’ breakout LP, Sound & Color. In turn, Mills wanted to push Legend to the limits of his emotional range. “There was this hole in John’s material that I felt like a huge part of his personality could come through,” Mills recently told Billboard. “We’re still talking about ‘What’s Going On’ some 40 years later. Yes, ‘Sexual Healing’ is a great track. But when we think of Marvin Gaye, ‘What’s Going On’ is the song that comes up.” The implicit criticism there rings true: Legend has calling-card songs like “Ordinary People” and “All of Me,” yet by and large, he makes safe R&B that doesn’t resonate long-term or hit hard politically (he released a collaborative LP with the Roots in 2010, but those were covers of Curtis Mayfield, Nina Simone, and Bill Withers.) For Darkness and Light, Mills wanted to merge Legend’s artistic and political sides, bringing the opinionated guy we see on “Real Time With Bill Maher” to the forefront. We hear shades of this on “Penthouse Floor,” a standout featuring Chance the Rapper, even if the grooving track behind Legend still feels more sultry than angry as he wonders: “All this trouble in this here town/All this shit going down/When will they focus on this?/Streets fired up with the TV crews/Look, Ma, we on the news!/But they didn’t notice before this.” Conversely, on the Miguel-featured “Overload,” Legend reflects on his marriage to model Chrissy Teigen, running down the endless distractions posed by the shiny device in his hand as a metaphor for connection (“Let that cell phone ring/Let that blue bird sing/Let that message say ‘unread.’”) The album comes full circle near the end, on “How Can I Blame You,” in which Legend is pulled over for a traffic violation—but instead of a menacing encounter, or a meditation on the rash of police shootings of black men during traffic stops, Legend uses the moment as a metaphor for life’s rapid pace. He’s urged to slow down and appreciate what he has. In the end, Darkness and Light isn’t the political feat Mills and Legend had hoped for, but it’s a step forward in the singer’s evolution. He may never be a firebrand, but Legend proves there’s still strength in humility.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22645-darkness-and-light/,Columbia,2016.0
77,Metallica,Hardwired...to Self-Destruct,Metal,6.5,November 22 2016,Zoe Camp,Contributor,"The past twenty five years haven’t exactly been kind to Metallica. Ever since their mainstream-rock apotheosis on 1991’s Metallica*,* they’ve faced a quarter-century losing streak: the bloated hard rock of Load, Reload, and Garage Inc., the snoozy live album-cum-orchestral-experiment S&M, the migraine-inducing ineptitude of St. Anger, and the recycled rage of Death Magnetic. In 2011, they teamed up with Lou Reed for Lulu, a collaborative concept album regarded by many as music’s answer to *The Room—*if Tommy Wiseau’s classic was twice as ambitious and half as competent—and the band’s undeniable low point (and that’s even with the tell-all masochism of 2003’s documentary Some Kind of Monster). Money, fame, age, a lack of passion: Critics have floated several culprits for the mediocrity of latter-day Metallica. But as drummer Lars Ulrich suggested in a recent *Rolling Stone *interview, the wellspring of the band’s foibles also forms the basis of Metallica writ large. “The thing that I love about Metallica is that we’re very impulsive,” Ulrich said, before tacking on a subtle mea culpa: “That impulsivity occasionally bites us in the ass, because we jump before we know where we're landing.” And so, five years after hooking up with Lou, and eight years after their last album proper, Metallica have taken yet another leap with Hardwired...to Self-Destruct, a two-disc collection demarcated not by a leap into the unknown, but into the halcyon days of their youth nearly three decades ago during thrash’s primordial period, when “impulsivity” amounted to unpredictable fretwork, breakneck rhythms, and discarded pretenses. Like Death Magnetic, the record attempts a self-conscious return to form; the only difference is that this time the band sound like they’re actually trying, and–dare I say it–maybe even having a bit of fun. Hardwired...to Self-Destruct is a rare Metallica album without any Kirk Hammett songwriting credits, a  shift owed not to Some Kind of Monster-type bickering, but flat-out carelessness: The guitarist lost an iPhone containing roughly 250 riffs, leaving him with little to contribute to the think tank by the time Metallica began cutting the album. Temporarily demoted from puppet master to personnel, Hammett readily embraces–relishes, even–his role as primary ambassador for Metallica nostalgia. Hardwired… stands as the guitarist’s most extensive show of muscle since the self-titled days. From the soaring, bluesy triplets on “Atlas, Rise!” to the fleet-footed stampedes driving “Spit Out the Bone,” his playing strikes a winning compromise between precision and wildness, lending the otherwise one-dimensional mix (undermined primarily by the anemic drum tracking, which renders Ulrich’s bass kicks little more than footsie taps) some welcome textural spontaneity. As for spontaneity on a broader level—don’t head into *Hardwired... *hoping for progressive surprises or unanticipated turns. Its twelve songs–the vast majority of which extend well past the five-minute mark–fall into two categories: galloping nods to Ride the Lightning, of which the first disc is primarily composed, and doomier mid-tempo cuts à la Sabbath, which make up the bulk of the second. The LP’s highlights—“Hardwired,” “Moth Into Flame,” “Atlas, Rise!” all fall into the former camp, front-loading the record with fire. The second disc, by contrast, is a slog through nondescript, uniform chug, devoid of dynamics or instrumental nuance: “Confusion”’s dull roar proves practically indistinguishable from the slow-churning gyre of “ManUNkind” or “Here Comes Revenge,” and the clunky mainframe of “Murder One” borders on incoherent. Fortunately, they finish strong with “Spit Out the Bone,” a galvanizing, hyper-speed premonition of a world razed to the ground by man’s greed for shiny playthings (like, say, Hammett’s iPhone): “Plug into me and terminate/Accelerate, Utopian solution/Finally cure the Earth of Man.” A little less than three minutes in, the band automize fiercely, careening off the leaden path into a pummeling breakdown unheard since the glory days. Elsewhere, James Hetfield redeems himself as Metallica’s growling figurehead with his strongest work in decades. The band’s 2014 tribute medley to fallen star Ronnie James Dio (which appears on the deluxe edition of Hardwired…) has clearly left a lasting impression on the 53-year-old, vocally and lyrically: whereas past releases found Hetfield howling the blues and roaringly introducing himself as literal furniture, Hardwired… marks a return to the matter-of-fact, staccato doomsday proselytizing of the band’s heyday. When he barks “We’re so fucked/Shit out of luck,” on the title track, teeth bared, fists clenched, we feel the pulse of his reckless youth ever-so-slightly—and for a second, the multi-millionaire feels like one of us, shaking in timely trepidation at the realization of the world’s greatest fears. And yet, even as he manages to rein in the cringeworthy wailing exhibited on *St. Anger *and the Load albums, he can’t resist backsliding into melodrama—obnoxiously extending out his syllables on “Now That We’re Dead” (“Now that we’re dead my DEEE-AHH we can be TOGETH-AHH”)–and on “Dream No More,” letting out a grunge-era whine that sounds like a failed impersonation of late legend Scott Weiland. Make no mistake—*Hardwired... is easily Metallica’s best album since 1991’s landmark self-titled LP, a victory on par with Weezer’s White Album *for comeback of the year. But as was the case with Cuomo and company, the album fails to convince non-diehards what, exactly, we look for from Metallica these days. Even after repeat listens, one can’t shake the feeling that in 2016, the legends’ students have become their teachers in terms of both sheer volume and political gravitas; those looking for fresh thrash, in its purest, most primal form are better off listening to the likes of Vektor, Power Trip, or Iron Reagan, who wave the torch of their forebears with considerably more gusto. Still, the band couldn’t return at a better time: when you flip on the news and see a narcissistic, trigger-fingered, despotic cheetoh at the podium—a Metallica song come to life—there’s no denying that the accessible aggro makes for a surprisingly potent balm, not to mention an enjoyable form of escapism.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22629-hardwiredto-self-destruct/,Blackened Recordings,2016.0
78,A Tribe Called Quest,We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service,Rap,9.0,November 17 2016,kris ex,Contributor,"Since their 1990 debut, People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, A Tribe Called Quest have been forward-thinking, presenting their albums as full-length meditations on sound and society. They didn’t break new ground as much as they dug deeper into the lands beneath their feet, turning stones and cultivating fertile soil, unearthing the past and tending the roots, with album-length suites centered around loose conceits—the light diary of *Instinctive Travels, *the aural dive into drums, bass, and downbeats of 1991’s The Low End Theory, the pan-African flight of 1993’s Midnight Marauders, the dysfunction of hip-hop’s materialism on 1996’s Beats, Rhymes and Life, and the yearning sadness of 1998’s The Love Movement. The latter strived to serve as a healing elixir and balm for what was, up until recently, the swan song for one of the greatest acts that hip-hop has ever produced. Alluded to constantly via rumors and unfounded hopes, a forthcoming Tribe album seemed like wishful thinking for years. Despite the assurances of legendary music executives, fans could not be blamed for being cynical. The group had splintered fabulously, as documented in Michael Rapaport’s unflinching 2011 documentary Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest. Moreover, the death of member Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor earlier this year, seemed to ensure that any future efforts would be full of excavated throwaways and repurposed vocals from other projects made fresh via studio magic. Yet, We got it from Here exists, their sixth (and final) album, and it’s full of unblemished offerings that were recorded at Q-Tip’s home studio following their performance on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show one year ago. And, against many odds, it’s an album that reinvigorates the group’s enviable discography without resting on the nostalgia of past accomplishment. The album’s first number, “The Space Program,” is quintessential Tribe—it has that sooty bottom heavy warmness, the uncluttered arrangements and bright instrumentation, and it sounds like a piece of 2016 instead of a fragment of 1994. For the first time in their career, the entire group appears to be at their peak, exuding a well-earned effortlessness. Even if Ali Shaheed Muhammad is listed nowhere on the credits, the act’s three MC’s—the abstract Q-Tip, the ruffneck Phife, and the often M.I.A. Jarobi—are on point all the time, picking up each other's couplets and passing microphones like hot potatoes. On “The Space Program,” Jarobi rhymes “We takin’ off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowin’/What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not goin’,” before Q-Tip nimbly takes over with “Reputation ain’t glowin’, reparations ain’t flowin’/If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowin’.” The song plays with a sci-fi framing—“There ain't no space program for niggas/Yo, you stuck here, nigga”—yet it’s not about an imaginary future, but right now. “Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude,” Q-Tip raps, unveiling the entire song as a metaphor for gentrification, perhaps even forecasting the showdown over the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock. And just that quickly, you realize that Tribe—poetical, allegorical, direct, and forever pushing forward from the present—are back as if they never left. The timeliness of this album can’t be understated, nor could it have been predicted. On “We the People…,” Q-Tip breaks out into a mini-song as hook: “All you Black folks, you must go/All you Mexicans, you must go/And all you poor folks, you must go/Muslims and gays, boy we hate your ways/So all you bad folk, you must go.” It follows in the pathways of Jamila Woods’ HEAVN and Solange Knowles’ A Seat at the Table as an album that expresses the deeply painful and deep-seated racist attitudes of current America without rancor. That the hook echoes President-elect Donald Trump’s most famous and reductionist campaign views works in ways that it would not had Hillary Clinton garnered enough electoral college votes to win the election. (For comparison, the video for Ty Dolla $ign and Future’s “Campaign,” released the day before the election, seemed to bank on a Clinton victory in its jubilation, but now feels tone deaf.) Ironically, Tribe may have also been seeing a Clinton victory; Q-Tip references a female president on “The Space Program.” A decade and a half ago, while working on his (erroneously shelved, then belatedly released) sophomore album Kamaal the Abstract, Q-Tip was asked about grown men making hip-hop music—he had, after all, just entered his thirties and was still playing at what is largely a young person’s game. He countered that hip-hop was not solely a youth genre; that the media and commercial forces had made it so; that the top MC of the moment—Jay Z—was in his thirties; that the best art comes not from the exuberance of youth, but the mastery of form. We got it from Here proves that he was right. Q-Tip has long been quietly regarded as one of hip-hop’s most thoughtful and inventive producers, and this album is full of accomplished flourishes. On the lascivious “Enough!!,” the vocals of Ms Jck (of undersung alt-R&B progenitors J*Davey) are treated like source material, woven into the musical bed. There are layered, echoing, melodic sonic manipulations and restrained uses of Jack White and Elton John on “Solid Wall of Sound.” On the introspective and confessional “Ego,” White (again) is used sparingly and smartly for subdued electric guitar touches. *We got it from Here *is not the music of a producer showing off, but of one knowing what to do and when to do it. There is a bevy of guests on this record, but they all serve the project like instruments that come in and out without attempting to take over with solo turns. When “Dis Generation” uses a sample of Musical Youth’s “Pass the Dutchie,” one can see a labyrinth of in-jokes and conceptual easter eggs that extends to the rhymes: Phife prefers cabs to Uber; Jarobi is wizened, smoking on “impeccable grass” and waiting for New York to approve medical marijuana; and Busta Rhymes—who appears multiple times and sounds more at home with his Native Tongues brethren than he ever has with the extended Cash Money bling set or even on his The Abstract and the Dragon mixtape with Q-Tip—is “Bruce Lee-in’ niggas while you niggas UFC.” For his part, Q-Tip shouts out Joey Bada$$, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole as “gatekeepers of flow/They are extensions of instinctual soul.” It’s what ATCQ has always been—self-referential without being self-serving, part of the pack but moving at their own pace, and able to lightly and relatedly convey observations that would be heavy and pedantic from just about anyone else. It can’t be said enough how simply good this record sounds and feels. Everyone here shows themselves to be a better rapper than they have ever been before, but that still doesn’t capture the ease and exuberance of it all, how Q-Tip curls flows and words on “The Donald,” how Jarobi surprises with packed strings of rhyme at each turn, how Phife and Busta Rhymes dip effortlessly in and out of Caribbean patois and Black American slanguage. (And that’s not even taking into account Consequence’s inventive word marriages on “Mobius” and “Whateva Will Be,” Kendrick Lamar’s energetic angst on “Conrad Tokyo,” or André 3000’s and Tip’s playful tag team on “Kids…”) The music is decidedly analog, a refutation of polished sheen and maximal perfection; it’s an extension and culmination of ATCQ’s jazz-influenced low-end theory. But that doesn’t capture the bounces, grooves, sexual moans, random bleeps, stuttering drums that float throughout—like every classic Tribe album, it defies simple descriptions. Many of the songs here hearken back to off-kilter and underexposed gems of days past (see: Tribe’s “One Two Shit” with Busta Rhymes and De La Soul’s ATCQ-featuring “Sh.Fe. MC’s” from days past for musical antecedents) without feeling like retreads, the free-wheeling whimsy and experimentation of the past having been replaced a grounded irony and proficiency. So much has stayed the same and yet so much has changed. There’s no overriding story that easily presents itself—no vocal guide a la Midnight Marauders, no driving ethos served on platter like the Low End Theory; the title itself, which lends to an interpretation of this as a project of hubris demanding homage, is never explicitly explained. Even Phife’s death is given due reverence, but isn’t treated as a central theme. *We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service *is all just beats, rhymes, and life. Nothing about this feels like a legacy cash-in; it feels like a legit A Tribe Called Quest album. We should be the ones thanking them.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22607-we-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service/,Epic,2016.0
79,Fugees,Blunted on Reality,Rap,7.6,November 5 2016,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"Pras Michel first came to Wyclef Jean at his dad’s church in New Jersey looking to join a band, not a rap group. Wyclef was already something of a local celebrity in the mid ’80s, writing raps in a session produced by Kurtis Blow for a group called Exact Change (on a single recording that was never released), and picking up the nickname the Rap Translator. Pras sought out Clef to play trumpet in the church band. As Wyclef tells it, Pras was a dreadful trumpet player, but he introduced Wyclef to two young musicians from his Newark high school: the mononymously known “Marcy” and a choir singer named Lauryn Hill. Even then, Hill was preternaturally talented, with a deep-rooted knowledge of R&B and Motown soul. Pras was an instrumentalist who was privy to rap as a kid but blocked from listening to it, instead spending long afternoons scanning the dials of his family radio for hard and soft rock. And he sought out Wyclef, who was already adapting the music of the Caribbean to fit his own, to add more reggae flavor into the mix. When Marcy abandoned the group after a few sessions, the trio adopted the name Tranzlator Crew, then later, Fugees. The Fugees, as many have come to know them, appeared fully formed in 1996 on “Fu-Gee-La,” the lead single from the trio’s ground-breaking, major label opus, The Score. But “Fu-Gee-La” predated the polished, finished project, starting as a raw loosie produced on the fringes of a session for a “Vocab” remix. It was created in the early-mid ’90s when the group was still experimenting, on a beat Salaam Remi originally made for Fat Joe. In those moments, before The Score was even conceived, the Fugees were slowly coalescing into a unit. Under the direction of Kool & the Gang co-founder Khalis Bayyan (then Ronald Bell), they were working on their debut album called Blunted on Reality. Each member had a unique musical history, leading to a sonic information trade of sorts—capitalizing on Lauryn’s internal soul music archive, Pras’ hard- and soft-rock reference points, and Wyclef’s reggae reworks. The smorgasbord of sound registered as rap but only when stripping several layers of context away; the Fugees packed reggae-flecked, raucous romps and remixes into 18 tracks, and attempted to package it as traditionalist hip-hop. The result was a commercial flop, selling (literally) 12 copies, and sending the group back to the drawing board. For all its eclecticism, Blunted on Reality is still a relic of its era—heavily indebted to rap’s elite samplers and sound-bending maestros De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Main Source, and even Digable Planets—and it's a bit raw and rough around the edges, a mostly croon-free ragga rap opus that’s far less explicit with its social and political ideals than The Score but twice as enthusiastic. The album scans as a style sampler of early ’90s alt hip-hop. But with the benefit of hindsight, it’s a fun, low-stakes gambit straddling the margins of boom bap, jazz rap, and reggae fusion without pause, and it’s a transformative experience for its MCs. The trio have said in the past that they let producers wrestle away creative control of the record, creating a product they didn't recognize, and they carefully distanced themselves from it during the press junket for The Score. But Blunted on Reality is essential to the myth of the Fugees and to the sonics of their seminal album. Without this commercial misfire, there is no colossal comeback story, no extra push to silence naysayers who wrote the album off as a failure, and they couldn’t have made something as refined as The Score without making this record first. Despite its status as the underwhelming precursor to a classic, Blunted on Reality is a marvel of pure energy and noise that musters up rage and exuberance in equal measure. It’s clearly a response to racial injustice, xenophobia, and inner-city violence, but the album never wages war with any of these topics directly. Instead, there are one-off references to shootings, to the Klan and black oppression, and to intolerance, amid a party pack. Its zeal is sadly as timely as ever. “Hide nigga hide, flee nigga flee, run nigga run/For I’ve got my hood, my cross, my tree, my gun/My rope, and it’s a long one,” Lauryn recites in the intro. Seconds later, Wyclef puts it even more plainly: “You maintain to put a negro in pain.” Blunted on Reality sits squarely at the intersection of New York City and Croix-des-Bouquets, mixing big-city swagger with an outsider’s mentality (ideas best articulated by interludes “Harlem Chit Chat” and “Da Kid From Haiti”). The reggae influence lines the seams of songs like “Temple” and “Refugees on the Mic,” which forgo heavy boom-bap for more leisurely, island-friendly tempos. The accents disappear on the shout-rap tracks, but sneak out for the hooks on “Recharge” and “Boof Baf” and in the opening moments of “Giggles.” It’s a triumph of black American immigrants, constantly mixing cultural cues. The breakbeat on the roughneck rousing “How Hard Is It?” is almost New Jack Swing-like, while “Nappy Heads” makes an escapist anthem out of an Earth, Wind, and Fire ballad. Slowly but surely, the Fugees find their voices on Blunted on Reality, taking turns with bludgeoning verses that do most of their damage with sheer force. Lauryn often sounds MC Lyte-ish in her inflections, less assured and measured in her pronunciations than she would become on later albums, but she is still clearly the group’s X factor, with raps that burst at the seams and a standout solo cut (“Some Seek Stardom”). When the dust had settled, the trio had three hit singles and a platinum album to their name, and Blunted on Reality had been reduced to an asterisk in the Fugee story, Lauryn would later tell Ebony in November ’96 that “kids need to know there’s more to life than a five-block radius,” that the Fugees spoke for the disenfranchised. The Score delivered that in its messages, but before that, Blunted on Reality proved it with an uncompromising sound.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22566-blunted-on-reality/,"Music On Vinyl,Music On Vinyl",1994.0
80,Lizzo,Coconut Oil,Rap,6.1,October 15 2016,Vanessa Okoth-Obbo,Contributor,"Lizzo is having a good year. The ink is dry on her deal with a major label, one of her songs got the silver screen treatment and she’s gracing the airwaves too, as a host of Wonderland—MTV’s new live music program. She found time in between all of this to finish Coconut Oil, a six-track EP that marks her official debut for Nice Life Recording Company, an Atlantic Records imprint. This busy stretch for the Detroit native coincided with an intense period of reckoning for the world at large. Every week brought renewed potential for despair, as images of war, humanitarian crises and police brutality were plastered across our TV, computer and phone screens in stunning high definition. Faced with this seemingly relentless stream of horrible news, and short of going off the grid completely to avoid it, taking time to look after your physical and mental wellbeing is a matter of survival. Coconut Oil is Lizzo’s ode to body positivity, self-love and the trials of getting to the point where you believe you deserve it. The perception of coconut oil as a cure for all of life’s problems has achieved legendary, and therefore meme-able, status. It’s now hailed as a balm to alleviate everything from the pain of heartbreak to the pressure of student debt. As an integral part of many skin and Afro haircare rituals, it has come to represent something very important for black women in particular, who rally around its power to heal from the outside in. From acknowledging this in the EP’s title down to making songs that speak directly to the lived experience of this demographic, Lizzo is both channeling and fuelling the zeitgeist under which black women’s oft-ignored specificities are being celebrated in popular culture. In some circles the substance that inspired the EP’s name is used with an almost religious fervor. Lizzo honors this sentiment by taking us to church on the title track, crooning “I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love, but all I needed was some coconut oil” against a backdrop of organs. It’s a light-hearted retelling of the journey from youthful insecurity (“I remember back, back in school, when I wasn’t cool”) through to hard-earned confidence, with a nod to the experiences and people that helped shape her along the way – especially her mother. Saved for last in the play order, “Coconut Oil” the most reserved and lyrically modest effort on what’s otherwise a very spirited collection. Over the five songs leading up to it, she pushes to the upper reaches of her vocal range, quite literally belting out her own praises with no hint of shyness. The twinkly opening keys of “Scuse Me” give you just enough time to prepare for the impossibly long bass drops and frantic drum sequences to follow, over which she explains just how much she’s feeling herself. Her pre-chorus line “Feeling like a stripper when I’m looking in the mirror, I be slapping on that ass getting thicker and thicker” plays out like a 2016 rewrite of “Oops (Oh My)” turned up to 11. Two promotional singles from earlier this year found a home on Coconut Oil. “Good As Hell,” featured in the latest installment of the Barbershop series, is brassy encouragement for anyone who is worn out from giving more than they get in a relationship. “Phone” is pure MPC and bassline magic, on which the existential dread of losing both your cellular device (“Where the hell my phone?”) and your friends at the club is somehow turned into a danceable moment. Weaving in and out of sung and rap verses on all but one song, it’s clear that Lizzo feels at ease in both of those spaces. Still, the EP as a whole doesn’t reach its sweet spot melodically. The mambo-inspired horns on opener “Worship,” give way to a chorus that drifts into show tune territory, leading into two very different syncopated dance rhythms before getting to “Deep.” If neither “Phone” nor “Good As Hell” brought you to this EP, “Deep” would likely be quick to standout as a club-ready dance tune with its soukous-inflected guitar riffs. There is nothing wrong with these elements individually, but it’s hard to know which thread to follow when they’re all packed into a running time of under twenty minutes. Lizzo’s career and sound have already been through many transformations: from rocker, to electro-soul crooner, to rapper and singer by way of on-air talent. Perhaps Coconut Oil works best when considered as a statement of intent – an inventory of all the things she’s good at, and a testing ground for how best to blend them in the future.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22511-coconut-oil/,"Atlantic,Nice Life",2016.0
81,Norah Jones,Day Breaks,"Jazz,Pop/R&B",6.9,October 11 2016,Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,"At this point of her career, it’s easy to forget that Norah Jones was once considered a jazz singer. Back in 2002, long before she worked with Jack White and Brian “Danger Mouse” Burton, Jones released Come Away With Me, an understated gem that went on to sell over 11 million units and earn eight Grammy awards—including Album of the Year and Song of the Year for “Don’t Know Why.” Armed with that voice—a wry, simmering inflection—the Texas native has proven she can sing anything, and sound natural doing so, no matter where the road has taken her. That said, it’s been tough to assess Jones’ creative arc. Feels Like Home, her 2004 sophomore LP, eschewed the traditional jazz of the first record for a folk/country sound. She’s released two honky-tonk country albums as a member of the Little Willies; and in 2012, Jones dropped Little Broken Hearts, a concept record about emotional anguish, set against Danger Mouse’s soulful pop arrangements. Elsewhere, Jones had notable features on Mouse and composer Daniele Luppi’s Rome; with Q-Tip, OutKast and Talib Kweli on their respective albums; and on the Robert Glasper Experiment’s Black Radio 2. Throughout all this, Jones has remained somewhat anonymous, mainly because she’s never appealed to pop and hip-hop consumers. Her music speaks to the adult contemporary crowd, those who actually buy CDs instead of streaming online. Jones has maintained a nice career largely out of the public eye; now 14 years removed from her seminal work, the musician returns to initial form on Day Breaks, her sixth studio album. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Jones said the genesis of the LP can be traced back to a 2014 performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., during a 75th anniversary concert for her label, Blue Note Records. She was performing a cover of songwriter Jesse Harris’ “I’ve Got to See You Again” with iconic saxophonist Wayne Shorter, drummer Brian Blade, and bassist John Patitucci. “When I started thinking about making a ‘jazz record,’ mostly I was thinking about recording with Wayne and Brian,” Jones told the Times. “I didn’t want it to be standards. I was hoping for something very rhythmic, with Wayne floating over the top.” Shorter, Blade, and organist Dr. Lonnie Smith appear throughout Day Breaks, an efficient 12-track set featuring nine original songs and three covers: Horace Silver’s “Peace,” Duke Ellington’s “Fleurette Africaine” and Neil Young’s “Don’t Be Denied.” *Day Breaks *is especially sparse, a no-frills record that fades into the background without much fuss. It seems to reflect the singer’s personal and professional comfort, that—after 15 years as a signed artist with more than 50 million records sold—Jones doesn’t need to adhere to industry pressures to remain relevant. Whereas some artists revert to their best-received work as a way to reignite past glory, *Day Breaks *feels like the logical next step for a singer who’s done just about everything there is to do musically. This one isn't a barn-burner, but it's not supposed to be. Unfortunately, though, *Day Breaks *grows a bit tedious near the middle, and it's easy to forget it's playing if you aren't paying attention. Lyrically, Day Breaks embraces a hazy—if not melancholy—vibe, similar to the Billie Holiday albums Jones listened to as a child. These tracks address some level of perseverance, a pushing through to better days whether romantically or socially. Jones uses a conversational cadence to tell these stories, bolstering the narrative and giving her words better impact. On “Flipside,” a song about racial and civic injustice, Jones and the band sound especially poignant. The other songs slow to a crawl, but this one is hard-charging with a strong message. “If we’re all free, then why does it seem we can’t just be?” Jones asks. “Put the guns away or we’re all gonna lose.” (As of this review, two more unarmed black men—Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina—were shot and killed by police for no reason.) And while Jones didn’t write the lyrics to “Peace”—it is a cover, after all—she effectively owns the message. “Peace,” she hums, “is for everyone.” Sure that’s a noble idea, but we’ve got a long way to go.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22307-day-breaks/,Blue Note,2016.0
82,Bon Iver,"22, A Million",Rock,9.0,September 30 2016,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"There’s a line deep in Thomas Pynchon’s Inherent Vice wherein Doc, a small-time stoner-sleuth, considers the dissolution of the 1960s, wondering if the decade wasn’t merely “a little parenthesis of light, might close after all, and all be lost, taken back into darkness.” It’s a funny way to think about time—that an entire era can be nudged back into the ether, erased. But on 22, A Million, the extraordinary third full-length from Bon Iver, Justin Vernon echoes Doc’s somber pondering. These are fluttery, skeletal songs that struggle against known trajectories and then threaten to disappear entirely. 22, A Million might be musically distant from For Emma, Forever Ago, the collection of aching folk tunes Vernon debuted in 2007—mostly gone are the acoustic strums, replaced by lurching, electronic gasps born from the Messina, a doctored combination of the Prismizer software plug-in and some hardware that was invented by Vernon and his engineer, Chris Messina. But the albums share an ideology. All things go, taken back into darkness. 22, A Million is certainly Bon Iver’s most difficult record; it’s the work of a songwriter who seems to have lost interest in established, easily deciphered forms, a possibility Vernon has been hinting at for nearly all of his career. In 2006, Vernon, then living in North Carolina, was emotionally razed by a perfect storm of shitty turns: his band broke up, his relationship dissolved, he came down with an acute case of mononucleosis. He did what any reasonable person with an eye toward self-care would do: decamp to his family’s hunting cabin in rural Wisconsin, drink a gang of beers, watch endless hours of “Northern Exposure,” and write a batch of lonesome, yearning folk songs on his acoustic guitar. His high, brittle falsetto gave these pieces an otherworldly quality, as if they had blown in on a particularly cold wind. For Emma, Forever Ago was, in its own way, an experimental record—Vernon’s vocals and phrasing are deeply unusual; its stories are impressionistic, fractured—but because it’s so heavy with heartbreak and loss, it feels intimate, authentic, easy. 22, A Million is comparatively strange and exploratory, but its worries are more existential. The album opens with a high, undulating voice (Vernon, singing into an OP-1, a combination synthesizer, sampler, and sequencer) announcing, “It might be over soon,” and goes on to examine the idea of impermanence. Nearly all of its songs contain a question of some sort, as if Vernon’s own reckoning with the inevitability of decay has led him to interrogate every last thing he’s seen or known. Inasmuch as his lyrics are narrative—and they have always been more connotative than exegetic—he seems preoccupied with whether or not a life has meaning. “Oh then, how we gonna cry? Cause it once might not mean something?” he asks on “715 - CRΣΣKS.” Kanye West once called Vernon his “favorite living artist,” and has long professed a deep and unexpected admiration for “Woods,” the closing track from 2009’s Blood Bank EP, and an obvious precursor to “715 - CRΣΣKS,” itself a kind of warped a capella jam. “Woods” featured no instrumentation, but is merely five minutes of Vernon singing through Auto-Tune, in ghostly harmony with himself. In retrospect, “Woods” feels like a revelation: it was not only an unexpected affirmation of pop’s future—artists aggressively distorting their vocals, feeding their voices into machines in order to build spectral, nagging songs that reflect alienation, arguably the reigning sensation of our time—but of Vernon’s own trajectory. Plenty of beloved contemporary artists, from Dylan to Neil Young on, have ditched the supposed purity of folk music to push the work harder, to make art that’s less reliant on a tradition and invests, instead, in the strangeness of the present moment and collective uncertainty about the future. Trading on preexisting pathways—it’s too easy. Vernon isn’t alone in his hunger for true, tectonic innovation, for songs that seem tethered to and reflective of their actual time and place: Radiohead has been mirroring anxiety about the encroachment of electronics and virtual living since Kid A, a record that also required them to warp if not abandon their beginnings as a guitar-rock band. Beyond its sonic striving, 22, A Million is also a personal record about how to move forward through disorienting times. Vernon occasionally employs religious language to express his anxiety, some explicit (“consecration,” “confirmation”), some more plainly vernacular (“So as I’m standing at the station,” “I could go forward in the light”). He samples two gospel tunes: Mahalia Jackson’s live version of “How I Got Over,” from 1962, and the Supreme Jubilees’s “Standing in the Need of Prayer,” from 1980. There is a song titled “666 ʇ,” and another titled “33 ‘GOD.’” A bit of marginalia in the album’s liner notes (“Why are you so FAR from saving me?”) is attributed to Psalm 22, though in the King James Bible, that imploration is for help, not salvation (“Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?”). Either way, Psalm 22 opens in medias res: its author is undergoing an urgent crisis of faith. So is Vernon? Maybe. Musically, Vernon resists not just verse-chorus-verse, but all the ways in which Western cultures have come to conceptualize narrative. As kids, we’re taught how stories work, and we use that rubric to organize and make sense of the events of our lives. But the imposition of structure can be violent; perhaps, Vernon suggests, the idea that we are organizing events at all is patently nuts. So when he ventures a line like “We’ve galvanized the squall of it all,” from “8 (circle),” it feels like a mission statement. There is solace in resisting formal structures, in both acknowledging and embracing a certain amount of chaos. It’s the same story on “00000 Million,” the album’s haunting closing track, where Vernon samples a wobbly line borrowed from the Irish folksinger Fionn Regan: “The days have no numbers.” Pitted against the record’s obsessive numerology—each song has a number in its title—it lands like an admission of defeat. There’s resignation in his voice, which gives way to desolation. The song’s lyrics will be familiar to anyone wondering if they’ll ever actually start to feel better, while still continuing to do something they know is hurting them: “If it’s harmed, it harmed me, it’ll harm me, I let it in.” For a while now, Vernon has been building songs in a modular way, and there are moments here (like the meandering last minute of “21 M♢♢N WATER”) where it feels as if he could’ve jiggled the pieces together a little more—where his disavowal of connective tissue feels less deliberate than random. This is evident, in part, because he is exceptionally good at writing melancholic laments in the highly structured style of ’80s soft-rock giants like Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Hornsby (Vernon has covered Raitt’s “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” and Vernon and Hornsby have collaborated on several occasions; “00000 Million” feels like it could have been recorded by either). “8 (circle)” is the most immediately reminiscent of Vernon’s last record, Bon Iver, Bon Iver, itself now recognizable as a clear midpoint between Emma and here; it’s also the album’s most conventionally composed track, with the smallest amount of vocal manipulation. Elsewhere, Vernon’s vocals are filtered until they begin to actually dissolve, as if they have been dunked in a tub of lye. The song’s stunning emotional peaks—I come to a full stop every time I hear Vernon sing, “I’m standing in the street now, and I carry his guitar,” his voice steady and deep, as if he’s announcing himself to someone he loves—are so plainly beautiful it’s hard not to mourn, briefly, for the Bon Iver of yesteryear. But 22, A Million sounds only like itself. There are precedents for all of Vernon’s moves deep in the histories of rock‘n’roll and rhythm and blues and electronic music—and, more immediately, on newer records by West, Frank Ocean, James Blake, Chance the Rapper, Francis and the Lights, and Radiohead. But this particular amalgamation is so twitchy and idiosyncratic it feels truly singular. Its searching is bottomless.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22420-22-a-million/,Jagjaguwar,2016.0
83,Devendra Banhart,Ape in Pink Marble,Folk/Country,6.6,September 27 2016,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"The cornerstone of Devendra Banhart’s career was an album called Cripple Crow. Released in 2005, the 22-track record presented Banhart as an artist brimming with ideas, surrounded by friends, and firmly at the center of a movement that was beginning to gain traction outside his indie bubble. Since then, Banhart’s career has been characterized by less momentous events: a DOA major label debut, some forgettable collaborations, a few art books. Especially considering his newfound penchant for breezy, non-confrontational pop music, in 2016, it’s hard to imagine Banhart being at the forefront of anything. While the artists he came up with have been striking career-bests through dramatic reinvention and childhood psychoanalysis, Banhart seems mostly content to plink away at his keyboard and entertain himself. On the whole, Ape in Pink Marble, his ninth album, doesn’t sound much different than Mala, his solid 2013 release. Teaming again with that album’s collaborators, Noah Georgeson and Josiah Steinbrick, Ape shares Mala’s wispy, low-stakes coziness. Despite the chilled-out atmosphere, however, Ape is a much darker listen, and its best moments are a reminder of why Banhart touched a nerve in the first place. Opener “Middle Names” laments the loss of a close friend over a chord progression not far from Dan Bejar’s “Chinatown.” The following “Good Time Charlie” is even better, tying a burbling folk melody to a weirdly touching narrative about a police officer. “Sometimes I breathalyze/And he gives the DUIs,” Banhart swoons before subverting the romance with a haunting question: “Is it love or just blood in his eyes?” With their gentle, psychedelic guitars and lilting vocals, these opening tracks come as close to Banhart’s sweet spot as he has since he first ventured out of it a decade back. Around the time of his last album in 2013, Banhart addressed a common criticism of his recent music: “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a friend [say], in this tender and discreet voice, ‘It’s just you and me bro, and I want to tell you the truth: make a record of you and an acoustic guitar. Please.’” Despite his self-awareness and the intimate strength of the opening tracks, Ape is not the return-to-form his friends have been pushing for. It’s dragged down by the same aimlessness that’s affected most of Banhart’s releases. Things get particularly dire in the middle stretch, with a pair of goofy tracks—“Fancy Man” and “Fig in Leather”—that are at once grating enough to disrupt the flow of the album and still anonymous enough to soundtrack a Chipotle. Even Banhart’s best albums had their share of jokey self-indulgence (let’s not forget that the “real good time” Banhart promised to have in 2004’s “This Beard Is for Siobhan” was just between him and a false set of teeth), but these songs represent the nadir of his recorded output. After those missteps, the album’s second half plays it fairly straight. Heavy on ballads and low on energy, Banhart sometimes comes in danger of scrubbing away any remnants of his once-magnetic personality. Occasionally, though, Ape approaches sparse brilliance. “Mourners’ Dance” is simple but effective, with a calming synth-and-vocals atmosphere that justifies Banhart’s Morrison-esque “raise the dead” intonations. Early single “Saturday Night” is the closest this album comes to a straight-up radio pop song—something that Banhart’s had his eye on ever since 2009’s “Baby”—and, with a dusky, OVO moodiness, it makes for one of the record’s finest moments. Ape closes with a pair of languid, burnt ballads, almost forcing the listener to drift out of focus. These tracks, however, are not entirely without charm. “Lucky” might seem like a plain admission of admiration, with its lovesick chorus and soulful guitars, but deeper listens reveal it to be more like a sigh of relief at the end of a troubled relationship, a quiet acceptance that the flame is gone. “Baby I can see the sun is setting in your eyes,” he sings as guitars twinkle around him, “Another reason why I’m lucky.” There’s a sense of freedom in his voice, hinting at a clean break from the past and a move toward more comfortable, if less inspired, territory. It just goes to show that Banhart might be more in control than we think, even when it seems like he’s barely there.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22423-ape-in-pink-marble/,Nonesuch,2016.0
84,Fleetwood Mac,Mirage,Rock,8.5,September 26 2016,Laura Snapes,Contributor,"After two records about cheating on each other, it was inevitable that Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine and John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood would begin to cheat on Fleetwood Mac. They were traveling in separate limos by the end of the bad-tempered Tusk tour, where Buckingham had kicked Nicks onstage, and they’d circled Europe on Hitler’s old train. “Looks like the end of the line,” the New York Post warned in March 1981, as solo careers started to proliferate. Fleetwood released The Visitor in June. Where Tusk had taken a year to record, Nicks’ debut album, Bella Donna, was nailed in a few days, released in July, and certified Platinum by October—just as Buckingham’s Law and Order limped to No. 32. Her blousy mystique was the antithesis of his uptight theme, and to dent his fragile ego further, it had been validated by serious men: collaborators Tom Petty, Don Henley, and producer Jimmy Iovine, who she was now dating. According to Buckingham’s then-girlfriend, Carol Ann Harris, he liked to refer to “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around” as “Stop Draggin’ My Career Around.” Having accepted that the band weren’t interested in “shaking people’s preconceptions of pop,” as he sniffed to any reporter who would listen, Buckingham resolved that Fleetwood Mac’s next album should be a proper group effort. Mostly minus Nicks, they mingled their ghosts with those of the haunted Château d’Hérouville, just outside Paris, a destination chosen to accommodate Monaco resident Fleetwood’s tax affairs. Harris observed communal meals eaten in silence. The drug intake exceeded even that of Tusk, according to co-producer Ken Caillat. It’s hard to find any comment about why they chose to name their thirteenth record (and fifth under this lineup) Mirage, though the resonance is obvious in hindsight: It’s the illusion of the band, rather than the full-blooded beast. Buckingham tossed off his songs in under two months. “What can I say this time/Which card shall I play?” Nicks sings on “Straight Back,” sounding like a woman in search of an idea. She pulls out her well-worn tarot deck—wolf, dream, wind, sun—and whips up an unconvincing sandstorm about how “the dream was never over, the dream has just begun,” while Fleetwood Mac increasingly resembled an inescapable nightmare. Fleetwood Mac’s internecine relationships and betrayals outdid any soap opera, though by 1982, they had plotted almost every conceivable love triangle and finally found partners outside the group. Mirage nixed any suggestion that drama and vicious recriminations were the band’s sole animating force, and flourished in the emotional void they occupied: heartbroken, strung out, and alone at the top. “Every hour filled with an emptiness I can’t hide,” Christine McVie sings on “Wish You Were Here,” referencing her split from the Beach Boys’ Dennis Wilson. Love and happiness become an illusion, an unattainable idyll only accessible to the gods: “Knowledge not meant for mortal fools,” Buckingham sings on “Book of Love,” though that doesn’t stop him and his cohort from clinging to the belief that someone, something out there can save them. “Never take your love away, begging you, baby,” McVie pleads on “Love in Store,” turning a trope into a frantic plea. Yet Mirage has a sunny desperation. Rumours’ harmonies return, the rhythms shuffle, xylophones tinkle, and acoustic guitars add innocent flourishes to every refrain. There’s a similarly nostalgic optimism to Donald Fagen’s The Nightfly, also released in ’82: Where Vietnam and Korea cast an ominous pall over Fagen’s paradise, Fleetwood Mac’s collective mania makes Mirage feel like fiddling while Rome burns. Buckingham in particular is hell-bent on leaping back several decades to escape all this mess: “Standing in the shadows, the man I used to be/I want to go back,” he growls on the peppy “Can’t Go Back.” Some of Buckingham’s perception-shaking DNA remained intact: “Empire State” is the opposite of “Oh Diane,” a daring pop song indicating that Tusk was the result of calculated genius, not just megalomania and madness. Buckingham praises the Big Apple and denigrates his native LA with a wild, removed lust that looks right through the object of his affection; when he sings about “flying high on the Empire State,” the lurching keys and harmonies make him sound like he’s being spun on his axis. (Fleetwood’s drums also sound fantastic, recalling Dennis Davis’ work on Low—also recorded at the Chateau.) Nicks also mainlines nostalgia, though hers is motivated more by loss than bitterness. “That’s Alright” harkens back to the country music of her childhood, and the precise mix is as rich as a watercolor where every color blurs and accentuates the next one. There’s a grace to her lyrics that’s absent on Tusk, conceding to a partner who just can’t work it out: “I can’t define love like it should be,” she sighs. “That’s alright, it’s alright.” And you can only imagine how mad Buckingham was when she swept in and stole the show with “Gypsy,” its chrome glint distilling her loss of self and the death of a childhood friend, and the optimism the couple felt as young bohemians in San Francisco. Buckingham is always attempting to harness his overheated energy to open up some kind of tear in the fabric of time and space, to step through and rediscover innocence. Nicks, though, conveys the sad wisdom of someone who knows you can never go home again. As ever, it’s McVie who maintains the most poise on Mirage, even as she languishes over Dennis Wilson. She’s just as lachrymose as on Tusk, but her songs rediscover the body she lost there. There’s adult acceptance in her voice on the Carole King-indebted “Wish You Were Here,” though the lyrics convey an adolescent morbid streak: “I can’t help feeling lonely/There’s no way, no way that I could stop.” “Hold Me” is one of the few moments on the record where McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham sing together. It’s the polar opposite of Tusk’s title track, where the three singers hissed their spurned collective demands. (“Don’t say that you love me! Just tell me that you want me!”) Instead, even as McVie is singing about Wilson, it plays as a plea for understanding and reconciliation between the estranged five-piece: “I don’t want no damage/But how am I going to manage with you?” They barely did. They fought on the video shoots for “Gypsy” and “Hold Me,” and the Mirage tour was short. Unsurprisingly, given the perfunctory nature of the sessions, there are few whole songs from the cutting room floor on this reissue: Nicks’ “If You Were My Love” is solid, and a more aggressive version of “Empire State” shows what might have transpired had Buckingham been allowed to make Tusk II. Warner Bros. were relieved that he didn’t: Mirage took the band back to No. 1 for the first time since Rumours, and spent five weeks there. The public preferred Fleetwood Mac as soft-rockin' comfort food. In a state of exhaustion and addiction, the five-piece papered over the cracks with an apple pie lattice, and saw other people for five years.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22134-mirage/,"Warner Bros.,Warner Bros.",1982.0
85,Usher,Hard II Love,Pop/R&B,6.6,September 21 2016,Rebecca Haithcoat,Contributor,"Like many child stars, Usher has struggled with his transition to adulthood. He was too old to be lurking like somebody’s creepy uncle in the 2010 video for “Lil Freak,” and too young to be belting like a 55-year-old who’s just bagged his first under-30 girlfriend in the song “Hey Daddy (Daddy’s Home).” But on 2014’s “Good Kisser,” a louche wink of a song, he figured out how to relax into exactly what he was: a dude in his mid-thirties with the abs of Michelangelo’s David, the dance moves of MJ, and the money of an artist who released the sixth best-selling album of the 2000s. He sounded breezy and at ease, finally confident enough to date women his age. So it’s a little disappointing that on Hard II Love, Usher’s eighth studio album, he hasn’t managed to hang onto that effortlessness. But there’s plenty to like, starting with his voice, which sounds better than ever. It helps that he’s back to doing R&B. Over the years, Usher has toyed with electronic music which never played to his strengths. Songs like the fist-pumping cash grab “OMG” are made for singers who rely on over-processing to plump up their vocals. Usher has a warm, rich, creamy voice that needs room to spread. Experts in dealing with exceptional voices like The-Dream and Tricky Stewart (“Bump,” one of many bangers on Hard II Love) and Paul Epworth (the glittery, star-flecked album opener “Need U”) clear out space for Usher to just be Usher. Especially on the first half of the album, the production is as sumptuous and smooth as Frette linens. Even relative newcomer Metro Boomin’s “Make U a Believer,” one of the record’s standout tracks, is at home among the veterans. The whole affair sounds so rich that the rootsy Raphael Saadiq-produced closer “Champions” is as out of place as a poor country cousin. As “OMG” illustrates, Usher is willing to do anything in order not to two-step gently into that gospel-by-day, grown-n-sexy-R&B-booze-cruise-by-night stage of his career, even though “Tell Me,” an eight-and-a-half-minute quiet storm track is just begging for a raging fire and bearskin rug. Hard II Love will keep him safe for now. For the most part, it’s sleek and modern, and it snaps right into the current R&B landscape. The one thing that rankles is that he jacks artists on the rise to do so. From the vocal phrasings to the lyrics, “No Limit” is such a Ty Dolla $ign song that I checked to see if Ty had written it. Of course, younger artists are influenced by more established artists. But when the situation is flipped, few people outside the music industry will know Usher is borrowing from Ty or Jeremih. Let them gain more mainstream recognition before helping yourself to their styles. Then again, Usher is always trying on new personas, and on Hard II Love, he tests out thug-lover Usher. And frankly, hearing him sing, “Tell me what nigga is perfect? Tell me what nigga is right? Tell me what nigga been with the same bitch and she been holdin’ it down for life?” on “FWM” (“Fuck With Me”) is like Ja Rule trying to sing a Luther Vandross song. Transitioning from “Need U (Conversation With Priyanka Chopra)” to “Missin U,” Chopra and Usher talk about what they want in a partner. Usher answers that he wants a beautiful woman with a “nice thin waist, fat ass.” Chopra, on the other hand, asks for a man who makes her laugh and feel safe: “He’s gotta be effortless, you know?” On Hard II Love, Usher isn’t that, but trying too hard hasn’t sounded this good in years.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22418-hard-ii-love/,RCA,2016.0
86,Led Zeppelin,The Complete BBC Sessions,Rock,8.2,September 20 2016,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Maybe you’re the person who hasn’t quite made up their mind up about Led Zeppelin. That’s fine but fair warning, the band is the apotheosis of overstuffed arena rock, from private jets to strong-arming managers to personal excess in every musical, sexual, and philosophical front. Lester Bangs wanted to chuck pies at them in defense of Truth and/or Iggy Pop. Hammer of the Gods depicted them as decadent goons and tried to make that seem admirable. Yo La Tengo’s “Sugarcube” video, without even needing to name them, reduced their lyrical and aesthetic sensibilities to an interest in “where the hobbits dwell.” If you’re a young music head who shuns rockism, appropriation, and womanizing as loathsome retrograde traits to be avoided, being into Zep means your faves don’t come more problematic. Still, rock dorks were tangling with this issue long before any of us, and in the context of reckoning with Led Zeppelin—especially as an oft-bootlegged yet still elusive live-band document—the official two-disc release of *BBC Sessions *in 1997 felt like a moment of clarity. Rhino’s 2016 reissue of the *BBC Sessions *is also a big important musical-legacy package deal, and justifiably so: Jimmy Page supervised a new remaster in the spirit of the studio album reissues that commenced two years ago, there’s an additional third disc that includes an unearthed performance that hadn’t been heard since its original 1969 broadcast, Dave Lewis’ contextual liner notes are informative and revelatory, and if you just love black-and-white photos of arcane recording gear and empty performance halls, you’re in luck. But above all that, it’s an exhaustive look at the lengths Led Zeppelin would go to for a chance to make it big through sheer force of music, and it’s borne out by witnessing the band in the process their own self-creation. Aside from Jimi Hendrix, a few jazzy UK prog bands, and the artists in the orbit of Miles Davis’ electric period, nobody working at deconstructing rock‘n’roll took such advantage of the possibilities of improvisation. To know Zeppelin as musicians puts that into focus: Jimmy Page flourished as an ex-session guitarist who still wanted to try any style as his own. John Bonham was so in the pocket even the fractions between the one and the two sounded deep. John Paul Jones strode with purpose along the border between groove’s backbone and a nomadic soloist whether on bass or keys. And Robert Plant’s voice could wring a Valhallan catharsis out of reading the cooking instructions on a box of macaroni. In isolation they were great; as an ensemble they were supernatural. It’s not that they were merely shredding or otherwise showing off: Led Zeppelin wanted to find out where those sounds they built, borrowed, and stole could really go. The first disc of *BBC Sessions *covers a stretch from early March to early August of 1969, a couple months after the release of their self-titled debut and a few before they dropped Led Zeppelin II. It seems wrong to call such a short stretch of time between first and second albums a “transitional period,” but that's what these sessions capture. The churning, riff-splintering heavy blues-rock of their debut is already shoving against the confines of what they’d already put to tape. They do their damnedest to wring new vistas from old Willie Dixon numbers on “You Shook Me” and “I Can’t Quit You Baby,” and there are moments where everything converges in waves of virtuosity that hint at picking up where the soon-to-disband Cream left off in the blues-rock supergroup sweepstakes. It’s when they stretch their legs on “Dazed and Confused”—still roughly album-length thanks to time constraints, and not yet the leviathan 20-minute concert centerpiece it was growing into—that their signature interplay starts to set them apart as their own entity, impossible to reproduce because they couldn’t stop moving. The in-progress nature of their 1969 material brings out some unpredictable sides. Hearing them hammer through live-set favorite “Somethin’ Else” in rockabilly mode is borderline surreal, especially with Plant rampaging through a vocal diametrically opposed to Eddie Cochran’s. And the third disc’s unearthing of a three-song session once feared lost is a fine addition—as well as the first time anyone born after 1969 can hear the piano-driven, harmonica-blasting “Sunshine Woman,” a B.B./Albert/Freddie King-simpatico cut which is perhaps their shortest line to electric blues as contemporary style rather than a mythical predecessor. (The sound is not great here. After the masters were erased, these cuts had to be sourced from a recording off of AM radio, but they’re an exception on a collection with otherwise pristine fidelity.) The most crucial detail of their ’69 sets is how nearly every BBC performance at the time included some variation of “Communication Breakdown.” You’d think it was their signature hit, or at least a cut that’d give them more critical affinity to the MC5 than Uriah Heep. It’s always the springboard for something new, from a revelation of how many ways Page could either slice or bulldoze his way through his solo to a hint at their engagement with funk that wouldn’t be heard so clearly again until The Song Remains the Same four years later. If the 1969 sessions were Zeppelin figuring out who they were, the 1971 sessions were Led Zeppelin figuring out who they weren’t. Broadcast on BBC Radio One’s “In Concert” on April 4, 1971, and famously featuring the first-ever version of “Stairway to Heaven” eight months before the release of Led Zeppelin IV, the second disc features the band stepping into the vast musical expanse they had laid before themselves. III was released the previous October and was their first shot at pushing beyond their “blooze” rep to more vivid folk influences. There’s still a medley that builds off “Whole Lotta Love” to skulk through foundational classics by John Lee Hooker (“Boogie Chillun”), Bukka White (“Fixin’ to Die Blues”), Arthur Crudup (“That’s Alright Mama”), and Elvis Presley (“A Mess of Blues”), but this chops-fest belies how hard the press mocked them for coming from a place the band would rather live in than visit as tourists__.__ And the peak-blues “Since I’ve Been Loving You” is where they finally figured out how to use their explosive power sparingly. Page’s solo and Plant’s wails pierce so deeply because they emerge from one of their most contemplative arrangements. But their confidence and their chafing at being pigeonholed made for a creatively lucrative combination and the period between the releases of *III *and *IV *was the best time to capture that. So we get the heavy metal equivalent of a chromed-god Jack Kirby *Thor *drawing in “Immigrant Song,” the careening time signature of a power-trio version of “Black Dog,” and the acoustic Joni Mitchell-fueled heartbreak of “Going to California.” Of course there’s “Dazed and Confused” snatched from its blues-rock cradle and transformed into the Kubrick *2001 *psychedelic stargate sequence of their live set, bowed guitar and everything. And if overexposure hasn’t dulled your senses to “Stairway to Heaven,” you can hear it as it first sounded before it was played approximately two billion times on the radio—even if the last Page solo hadn’t yet found its footing. From a present-day perspective, where big-time arena-filling rock has settled on Muse, Foo Fighters, and 5 Seconds of Summer, diving headlong into the ’69/’71 timeframe of the band that most necessitated the obnoxious yet fitting phrase “Rock Gods” might otherwise feel like history homework. But *BBC Sessions *captures an actual excitement, a document of a moment in an oft-told story of a band that isn’t excessively beholden to it. No *Song Remains the Same *audio-visual stoner-movie overkill, no excess studio futzing, no sense that their peak was either already there or just in the rearview. It’s just a meticulous document of a band whose hedonism kept them from restraining their absurd level of mastery. So here: have Zep as they both wanted to be and eventually were.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22402-the-complete-bbc-sessions/,"Atlantic,Rhino,Atlantic,Rhino",1997.0
87,Mac Miller,The Divine Feminine,Rap,7.8,September 17 2016,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"Mac Miller isn’t the Divine Feminine. The Pittsburgh keg-stander turned style-sampling artisan isn’t making a play at defining femininity. This isn’t an attempt to examine feminism in any way. He isn’t being facetious or woke. In fact, he doesn’t even try to explore what being a woman is like in any sense in any of these texts. The Divine Feminine, a concept record of sorts in distinct contrast to September 2015’s GO:OD AM, is an album about love as it relates to the female form and beyond, as Miller has referred to it, “the feminine energy of the planet.” It broaches smaller, bite-sized topics revolving around romance and connection in an attempt to understand the universe at large, bringing to mind a quote from Carl Sagan’s 1985 sci-fi novel Contact: “For small creatures such as we the vastness [of the universe] is bearable only through love.” When Miller talks about The Divine Feminine, he considers the universe, the distance between persons, and deciphering love on an ideological level. He’s mentioned playing the record for a couple and slowly observing them cut the distance between each other in a room as it progresses. “I want people to put on the record and it’s a date in itself,” he told i-D. “I want people to love to this record and realize they can love to it.” There’s a very real connective tissue to these ideas of space and intimacy. It’s about contact and togetherness, closing the gap between people; about being in unison and growing apart, and all the stages in between. It peels back and exposes the many layers of love—romantic, schmaltzy, sensual, carnal, wilting. It’s easily his most intoxicating release yet, an odyssey of soulful compositions paring down his expansive and eclectic soundboard from the last few years into something distinctly cozy and pleasant. Mac Miller has put in hard work establishing himself as a Serious Rapper since the release of his emotionally and sonically flat debut Blue Slide Park, putting on his fair share of wordplay showcases and aligning himself with the right people since his sprawling breakout Watching Movies With the Sound Off in 2013, but much of that work came off as pandering or, worse still, overly earnest. He’s gotten more comfortable in his own skin with each release, but that threatened to be an issue here, given the title. Yet, The Divine Feminine is by far the most settled he's ever been. There aren’t any plays to satisfy or ingratiate a specific subgroup of listeners. There aren’t any lyrical exercises or overthought exhibitions of verse structure and execution, no plays to prove himself a rapper’s rapper—frankly there’s almost more singing than rapping. But this is his most nuanced release, a record that forgoes personal narrative and somehow reveals his individuality in the process. He does it all with just a little help from his friends. The album interlocks a diverse array musicians without losing the main thematic thread. The fingerprints of his sonic soulmate Ariana Grande are all over the record: backup vocals, feature vocals, voiceover work, and her positive influence on him shows. Cee-Lo Green lends his unmistakable vocals and energy to “We,” which simmer just above the surface of crisp drum kicks. Miller and Kendrick move in tandem on the epic closer “God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty” without any competitive tension. Students from Juilliard played strings on the album, and they accent the arrangements well. He even gets noted lothario Ty Dolla $ign to play a gentleman (or at least as close to that as he gets) on “Cinderella,” which is no easy task. As a group, led by Miller’s pronounced vision, they forge the lover’s guide to the universe, painting in tiny brush strokes from a warm and familiar tonal palette. The Divine Feminine has very specific set of sonic reference points: the rich and heavy funk of Anderson .Paak’s Malibu, flexed into with help from Dâm-Funk and .Paak himself on tracks like “Dang!”; flecks of the Social Experiment’s juke and jazz (especially on “Stay”); even the electro-fused alt R&B of a producer like Kaytranada. It’s heavily indebted to the growing fusion jazz rap movement with contributions from pianist Robert Glasper, Brainfeeder bass maestro Thundercat, and trumpeter Keyon Harrold, sometimes appearing in the record’s margins, but usually as full-fledged performers (the first two also played on To Pimp a Butterfly). The Divine Feminine reins in Mac Miller’s wide-ranging taste, bonding aesthetics and fully realizing his artistry. It’s worth noting that The Divine Feminine has the fewest tracks of any Mac Miller album and that it is the clearest, most concise record of his career; that’s a correlation, not a coincidence. The project started as an EP, but it became a full album as Miller continued to flesh out its ideas. Across its 10 songs, it observes love as a part of the human experience without forcing any beliefs on the listener, dealing mostly in the building blocks of feelings. “Dang!” and “Stay” play back-to-back and examine loss of love close up. The Grande duet, “My Favorite Part,” is basically the downtempo reprise of One Direction’s “What Makes You Beautiful.” The album’s emotional and sonic center is “Planet God Damn,” about becoming vulnerable, a sentiment echoed by Njomza on the hook: “Tell the truth/Show me you.” As the closer, “God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty,” trails off into Glasper piano chords, a widow recounts how she fell in love with her husband, punctuating her story with a mantra: “How important it is to love, respect, and care for each other.” That kind of union is something Miller clearly strives for, something he calls “the best love story in the world.” The Divine Feminine doesn’t just chase that, it bottles the very essence.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22293-the-divine-feminine/,Warner Bros.,2016.0

After Purple Rain put his crowd-stunning skills on worldwide display, subsequent concert artifacts took the form of coffee table books or low-profile home video releases. And he could be a merciless tease. With “It’s Gonna Be a Beautiful Night,” from Sign ‘O’ the Times, Prince offered listeners an onstage clip of the Revolution operating at peak inspiration only after he’d broken up that band. During the compilation set Crystal Ball, the conclusion of a searing live take on “The Ride” is rudely cut off by the forgettable dance number ""Get Loose."" These perversions are not unwitting. Prince knew admirers bootlegged his shows. Message boards on his various online “music clubs” were often clogged with requests for official live discs. In 2002, before his Musicology comeback, he gave these hardcore fans what they wanted, at long last. Sort of. One Nite Alone…Live! was a box set that chronicled the tour in support of Prince’s similarly titled piano-and-vocals CD. But these setlists also explored another recent Prince recording, *The Rainbow Children—*a concept album that heralded his conversion to the Jehovah’s Witness faith. Given the outlier that Children was in his catalog, a follow-up live release that repeated the same sermons over its first two discs was met with some frustration. Still, most detractors couldn’t ignore the third CD, which presented a rush of screaming blues licks, rowdy funk-ensemble workouts, and sultry soul, all captured during “aftershow” parties from this same tour. Years later, Prince carved out this third disc as a standalone title for sale on one of his websites. Similarly, it is now available for streaming and purchase on Tidal, along with the majority of the NPG Records catalog. There’s much to savor from that oft-overlooked wilderness period, but the urgent showmanship of One Nite Alone… The Aftershow: It Ain’t Over! makes it a highlight in Prince’s discography and a gratifying, much-needed connection with his ability to take it to the stage. While avoiding his biggest hits, this nearly hour-long ride finds Prince engaging with key selections from his repertoire. The opening song, “Joy in Repetition,” dates from sessions that produced Sign ‘O’ the Times, and was later included in the scattershot soundtrack to Prince’s box-office bomb Graffiti Bridge. Here, Prince airs it out for over ten minutes, recasting it as both a band-introduction tool and a showcase for his electric guitar showboating. Subtle revision of the song’s lyrics is as close as he comes to any lecturing on Aftershow. Prince ad libs a brief bit about his new aversion to “four-letter words,” though the singer’s come-hither delivery ensures that the change does no harm to the song’s slinky vibe. Gradually, his command of the blues emerges as the focal point of the performance. The unhurried stretches of soloing carry a different air than other Prince guitar clinics—such as his famed feature during a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame tribute to George Harrison. He obsesses over individual passages with a spiritual ferocity that can stand with late-period Coltrane. It’s indulgent, excessive, and brilliant. Then George Clinton joins the band, and the intergenerational lineup of funk visionaries gels just like you’d hope. In the early going of “We Do This,” the track has a loose-booty feel that provides ideal support for Clinton’s scat-rap. And while Prince starts out by shooting rhythm guitar darts into the pocket, the jam climaxes when Clinton’s raspiest vocalizations spur some joyous, arcing lead lines from the bandleader. This song is the most compelling meeting between the two artists yet to see the light of day. The guest-vocalist portion of the show concludes with Musiq’s appearance during a brief medley that mixes his own tune “Just Friends (Sunny)” with Sly Stone’s “If You Want Me to Stay.” After the different extremes advanced by the opening two songs, this selection introduces the more relaxed aesthetic that Prince could use to make these late-night encounters with a global icon feel like casual parties. Since these recordings date from Prince’s peak period of overt jazz exploration, his backing band is skilled in the art of reinterpretation. The rhythm section of drummer John Blackwell and bassist Rhonda Smith helps transform deep cuts like the instrumental “2 Nigs United 4 West Compton” into something less nervy than Prince fashioned by himself during sessions for The Black Album. On Aftershow, the mood is exultant and celebratory. “I wanna sing, but it’s too funky,” the artist tells the crowd at one point. And then, after steering the band through a brisk “Alphabet Street,” he mostly dispenses with pop-song singing—all the better to work as a dance instructor for the rest of the album. During the infinity groove of “Peach (Xtended Jam),” Prince reminds concertgoers that this isn’t an arena rock show, but a club (“Ain’t nothing to look at; y’all just party where ya are.”) Then, at the turnaround, he unveils a new rhythm guitar progression: a line that begins with an aggressive stabbing figure, and then rolls on with delirious suavity. It’s a reminder of Prince’s guitar heroics outside the realm of the solo. The way the whole set works brings to mind black scholar Albert Murray’s understanding of the “Saturday Night Function” during the period of early jazz, which the theorist contrasted with the role of the Sunday morning gospel service. In discussion with Wynton Marsalis, Murray described the Function as “a purification ritual where you get rid of the blues. And as soon as you get rid of the blues, it becomes a fertility ritual. . . . The union of lovers, which is the salvation of the species! . . . If it’s not sexy, forget it.” On his “One Nite Alone” tour, Prince reversed the chronology, putting the sermons during the main gig, and providing erotic release at the aftershow. Both halves of the experience should be fascinating for any fan of this elite composer and performer. But if you’re downhearted by his absence, it may be that you'll want to turn to the blues-chasing set first. Unlike the nudist dip in Lake Minnetonka prescribed to Apollonia during Purple Rain, the purification ritual on offer here is no joke.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22338-one-nite-alone-the-aftershow-it-aint-over/,"NPG,NPG",2002.0
89,The Beach Boys,Becoming the Beach Boys: The Complete Hite & Dorinda Morgan Sessions,Rock,5.3,August 31 2016,Stacey Anderson,Senior Editor,"Brian Wilson wasn’t born a pop Zeus, suffused with orchestral grandeur and full “teenage symphonies to God” in his head—he was once a gawky, deferential teen who sang a terrible song about a doll. It helps temper the decades-long fetishization of his genius and makes Becoming the Beach Boys: The Complete Hite & Dorinda Morgan Sessions, the rough audio of their earliest studio hours, a refreshing listen. It acknowledges how very far Wilson and his bandmates began from the gorgeous harmonies and slick pop songwriting that made their fame, and serves as a reminder that even if we admire artists who seem youthfully irrepressible, we’re often coming in at their 10,001st hour. The Morgan sessions, recorded in 1961-62, find the young Beach Boys (ages 15 to 20) floating their first material in the Hollywood home of producers Hite and Dorinda Morgan. Instead of whirling around the studio playing maestro and directing orders, in a take of his sonorous ballad “Surfer Girl,” Wilson meekly asks to overdub his bass (Hite Morgan barks back, “No,” and the matter is closed). The rest of Becoming the Beach Boys falls in line with this moment, a minutely parceled collection of occasionally insightful false starts and hesitancies. Its nine songs span 63 tracks, many under a minute and punctuated by tape skips, giggles, even the odd admission of burping. (The culprit is never identified but sounds like it could be Dennis Wilson, undersung singer/songwriter behind the group’s gorgeous “Forever.”) Forty-five of these pre-Capitol Records cuts were previously unissued; the rest appearing on such long-forgotten cobblings as The Beach Boys’ Biggest Beach Hits, released in 1969, and Lost & Found 1961-62*, *released in 1991. Remarkably, for the first material the Beach Boys ever attempted, three of these tracks would become huge hits—the chipper “Surfin’” and “Surfin’ Safari,” then, a year later, “Surfer Girl.” The first stabs of these are boisterous: “Surfin’” lurches out of the gate, its demo skittish with those now-familiar doo-wop bass vocals. Carl, Dennis, and Brian Wilson’s harmonies are tinnier with a twinge of stuck-chin bravado, even through the rather unconvincing insistence that “We’ll do the Surfer Stomp/It’s the latest dance craze.” (The cloddish move was a real, short-lived trend in the Boys' native Hawthorne.) Two years before Wilson’s production debut on “Surfer Girl,” in which he nurtured its luxurious harmonies and added the iconic falsetto top note, the song makes a halting introduction here in chord progressions more minor and morose. “Surfin’ Safari” is led confidently by Mike Love, with shades of the nasal tones he would later refine and popularize, even while his noncommittal placeholder mumbling veers towards “Flight of the Conchords” in the third and fourth takes. Six songs here never made the Boys’ studio output, and rightfully so. They range from “Beach Boy Stomp (aka Karate),” a surf-rock instrumental à la Dick Dale and the Surfaris, which sounds like a sandy spoof on the Champs’ hit “Tequila,” to the swingy pop ditty “Judy.” The master version of the latter features some of the most indicative hints of the band’s vocal promise, liquid tenor topping a sturdy bass. The song’s namesake was Judy Bowles, Brian Wilson’s first serious girlfriend. In his forthcoming memoir, I Am Brian Wilson, he recalls her fondly but also unearths an old vendetta with Mike Love for trying to dance with her. This would not be the last time Love would encroach on his turf. “Barbie,” a schmaltzy teenybopper ballad, rings as it was: writer Dorinda Morgan’s attempt to capitalize on a trendy new plastic doll. Even the Scotch 111 tape it’s recorded on seems to disdain this slavish, sluggish praise of “Barbie, Barbie, queen of the prom/Turned down dates with Eddie and Tom”—two of the takes are thwarted by skipping and scrambling effects. The unsettling ragtime piano jaunt “What Is a Young Girl Made Of” sounds like the soundtrack to a Woody Allen fever dream; incongruous in its tetchy delivery by Brian Wilson, it scarcely improves over seven more attempts. The Beach Boys have varied in lineup over the past 20 years—sporadically with Brian Wilson, usually under the pallid and reliably dickish thumb of Mike Love—but their camp has been constant in its steady stream of ‘60s material reissues and compilations, ranging from seismic to “at least Dad’s Christmas present is sorted.” Becoming the Beach Boys is, true to the name of the label that dispatched it, a curio for those who have heard the band’s full works and wish to gorge further on the scant unexplored crumbs of their history—or for those who collect Barbies.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22331-becoming-the-beach-boys-the-complete-hite-dorinda-morgan-sessions/,Omnivore,2016.0
90,Vince Staples,Prima Donna,Rap,8.0,August 30 2016,Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,"Lest you worry that critical acclaim and fame have brightened his outlook, Vince Staples opens the *Prima Donna *EP with a grainy recording of him singing “This Little Light of Mine,” cut short by the sound of a gunshot. Staples barely mumbles the song under his breath, making you lean in close to the speaker; the gunshot that punctuates the track might make you jump out of your seat. This intro provides a handy metaphor for how Staples operates as an artist: He draws you in with vital music, then hits you with the ugly reality. He’s clear on at least this much from the outset on Prima Donna—if you’re here for an uplift, you’ve come to the wrong place. On his debut full-length, Summertime ’06, Staples proved that he was not just a great rapper but a great album artist, crafting an immersive sound that transcended its production credits. Despite the impressive array of producers who worked on the album (No I.D., Clams Casino, DJ Dahi, Mikky Ekko), Summertime’s feel was uniform, a creaky, humid canvas on which Staples painted his morally ambiguous street tales. Still, while Staples might have just cemented his aesthetic, he’s already looking beyond it. Far from an effortless victory lap, Prima Donna finds the rapper veering off in a number of different directions in search of new sounds to bend to his will. No I.D. and DJ Dahi return to produce the bulk of Prima Donna’s tracks, though their mandate this time around seems to be sonic experimentation. “Smile” is practically a rap-rock song: fuzzed-out bass, a steady guitar upstroke, an unapologetic solo in its midsection. “Pimp Hand” sounds like a heart monitor wired up to a trunk full of muffled subwoofers. “Loco” matches Staples’ breathless narration of his descent into madness with shrill glissandos; more importantly, it contains some of the EP’s most richly evocative lyrics (“I’m in the black Benz speeding with my black skin gleaming” is a whole poem in a single line). As much as No I.D. and Dahi push past their own boundaries here, Prima Donna’s two most adventurous beats come courtesy of James Blake. While the English musician has occasionally flashed a deft hand as a hip-hop producer, we’ve never heard anything quite like these instrumentals from him. “Big Time” sounds both airy and dense, cobbling together Atari buzzes, snares that sound like money counters, and stray whirring noises. Atop all of this, Blake slowly piles up layers of skittering drum tracks until the whole thing wobbles like a Jenga tower. Staples raps furiously atop this beat, sketching out a dark counterpoint to Drake’s carefree YOLO meme (“You never know when you gon’ catch a case/Never know when you gon’ catch an eye”) before a plaintive chiptune melody creeps in. And then there’s “War Ready,” the EP’s strongest cut and one of the most striking songs either man has had a hand in. Blake kicks off the track by flipping a chopped up sample of André 3000’s final bars from “ATLiens” over a bed of bubbling sounds. The song then segues to a skeletal arrangement that consists of little more than a single synth line laid over a steady click-clack beat—an instrumental so sparse it makes the Neptunes sound like maximalists. All the better, though, to fully appreciate Staples’ lyrics, which are as devastating here as they’ve ever been. Expanding on an idea from his Clams Casino collaboration “All Nite” (“My people ready for war”), Staples reaches back into the history of oppression to draw parallels with the present: “County jail bus, slave ship, same shit/A wise man once said/That a black man better off dead/So I’m war ready”. When he delivers the line, “Turned the African into the nigga then they hung him,” it lands with the same impact as that gunshot in the intro. Hopelessness has always been a throughline in Staples work but Prima Donna puts a finer point on that feeling, both in its songs and interstitial spoken word bits. Staples repeatedly tells us that he’s fed up, he’s tired, he feels like giving up. And can you blame him, an artist who has spent his career cataloging the brokenness around him? On Summertime, Staples studied his own city as a microcosm of America, but here he zooms out even further, inviting you to see the bigger picture. At his best, Vince Staples is an artist who stares hard truths dead in the eye. On Prima Donna, he dares us to do the same.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22296-vince-staples-prima-donna/,"Def Jam,Blacksmith,Artium",2016.0
91,The Roots,Things Fall Apart,Rap,9.4,August 28 2016,Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,"In 1999, the Roots were in limbo. The Philadelphia hip-hop band had released three critically acclaimed albums but were still considered something of a novelty act, featuring a big guy with a big Afro on drums (?uestlove), a sharp but unshowy MC (Black Thought), two beatboxers (Rahzel and Scratch), and a stellar live show—all anomalies in the gilded age of Puff Daddy and the million-dollar sample clearance. The Roots had by this time amassed a faithful cult following, but none of it translated to mainstream success. They were selling more records and slowly moving beyond their dedicated base of jazz and traditional rap purists, but their career wasn’t headed anywhere in particular. Reflecting these tensions, the Roots opened their fourth studio album, Things Fall Apart, with dialogue from a scene from Spike Lee’s 1990 film, Mo’ Better Blues, in which characters Bleek Gilliam and Shadow Henderson—played by Denzel Washington and Wesley Snipes, respectively—debate the state of jazz music. Gilliam doesn’t want to sacrifice his creative vision to pander to crowds, and he thinks black people should come to his shows simply because he’s making black art. “That’s bullshit,” Henderson quips. “The people don’t come because you grandiose motherfuckers don’t play shit that they like.” The clip seemed to acknowledge the Roots’ reputation: They were too smart for their own good, too self-aware, and they were getting in their own way. It was as if, from the very beginning, the band sought to be misunderstood, to find somewhere to hide from the mainstream. As unique as the Roots were—they were a hip-hop band, after all—their music still had traces of what was popular at the time. Their 1995 album Do You Want More?!!!??! featured the sort of laid-back jazz feel that Digable Planets had perfected the year before on Blowout Comb. The Roots’ follow-up, 1996’s I**lladelph Halflife, was more aggressive and confrontational, taking lyrical and sonic cues from the Wu-Tang Clan. But the group was searching for something different. Before the release of Things Fall Apart, they had positioned themselves as a sort of remedy for the excesses of Bad Boy’s empire, which in those days became an all-too-easy target for the backpacker set. In their satirical 1996 video for “What They Do,” the Roots mocked the sort of rap video stereotypes popularized by director Hype Williams, thumbing their collective nose at champagne bottles and mansion parties. Acts like the Roots wanted to give listeners the “real shit,” but while they and others criticized Bad Boy’s gravitational pull, their art-rap aesthetic was its own form of marketing. They just hadn’t figured out what they were selling. While the Roots thought of themselves as the anti-establishment alongside acts like OutKast and the Fugees, those groups sold millions of records when the Roots were struggling to go gold. By 1997, before the sessions for Things Fall Apart began, drummer and bandleader ?uestlove was exploring new opportunities beyond the Roots. He was more concerned with recording D’Angelo’s Voodoo and Common’s Like Water for Chocolate than he was with his own group. It wasn’t that he wanted to leave the Roots, but still, his outside projects created resentment amongst band members who questioned his focus. “In my head at that time, the notion of a Roots album was a distant third,” ?uest wrote in his 2013 memoir, Mo’ Meta Blues. He was spending time with Voodoo engineer Russell Elevado, learning new ways to manipulate sound to give his own music a more granular, less studied feel. He wanted to be a heralded producer like DJ Premier and J Dilla, but his band’s work felt remarkably clean—even sterile__—__in comparison. The best rap of that era had to feel at least a little gritty: Though the Notorious B.I.G. was signed to Bad Boy, his 1997 album Life After Death had plenty of dark, violent narratives. The Wu’s massive double album, Wu-Tang Forever, was full of woozy street bangers, courtesy of the group’s production team, with the RZA at the helm. Realizing he needed to improve as a producer, ?uest learned how to play drums “dirty,” taking Dilla’s lead and dragging his percussion just a bit to make the beat seem off-kilter. The genesis of Things Fall Apart can be traced back to a hangout ?uest had with Premier, Dilla, and D’Angelo, where he played them a rough version of a Roots song called “Double Trouble” and got disinterested head-nods in return. Determined to bolster the track, ?uest recorded drums to two-inch tape, looped it back through the soundboard, and tweaked the EQ to give it a feeling of distance. “It was a turning point in my understanding of my own career,” ?uest wrote in his memoir. “I knew that the other guys respected me as a drummer… but I also wanted them to respect me as a producer and a songwriter.” In its finished form, “Double Trouble” is arguably the centerpiece of Things Fall Apart; rapper Black Thought finally had a hard-charging instrumental to match his verbal dexterity, and guest Mos Def matched him bar-for-bar. Things Fall Apart is where the Roots figured out who they were—it wasn’t “just another Roots record,” and if the group was going to fail, they were going out their own way. “Table of Contents (Part 1)” illustrates their new willingness to take risks: The breakbeat is messy and the mix is intentionally pinched and lopsided, but the track’s feeling of chaos is an ideal table-setter, opening the record on a tense and uncertain note. On “Step Into the Realm,” the drum loop fades in and out, but the rhythmic instability makes the rappers’ audibly distorted vocals sound even more urgent. If the Roots’ first three albums mastered the meeting point between jazz and rap, this was the first time the band went psychedelic, opening up new possibilities sonically and lyrically. D’Angelo’s 1995 album Brown Sugar and Erykah Badu’s Baduizm from 1997 were the blueprint for new-school soul music, and Things Fall Apart applied those ideas to hip-hop proper. In this aesthetic space, artists with different approaches could find new ways to be creative together, and a new movement was being born. “You Got Me,” the lead single from Things Fall Apart, found a crooning Badu next to rapper Eve from the Ruff Ryders over a lilting guitar figure and strings. The classic arrangement and eclectic mix of voices, paired with ?uestlove’s typically propulsive and cutting backbeat, sounded both old and new, looking backwards and forwards simultaneously. The Roots were pushing the limits of their sound, establishing a lane for D’Angelo, Common, and Badu to do the same. By building a musical community and mastering the art of collaboration, they figured out how to cross over and keep their soul intact. Things Fall Apart was the Roots’ most successful record, and after years in the shadows, they were finally getting radio airplay and touring as headliners. The album went gold two months after its release and hit platinum in 2013. In addition to its commercial success, it served as a launching pad for new voices, like Roc-A-Fella rapper Beanie Sigel, who debuted as a guest artist on “Adrenaline!,” and Eve, whose “You Got Me” appearance was her most prominent feature at the time. The relatively unknown Jill Scott wrote the chorus for “You Got Me” and was slated to sing on the track until MCA Records pushed for a bigger name (Badu) to appear in her place; soon, Eve and Scott would release their own platinum-selling albums. Despite being a breakthrough for their band and their scene, the Roots didn’t immediately build on Things Fall Apart’s success. Powered by D’Angelo’s sultry “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” video, Voodoo became a phenomenon, and ?uest spent most of 2000 on tour as the singer’s drummer. By the time the Roots re-grouped, ?uest’s closest peers were pushing their sounds to new places. D wanted to learn guitar; Common and Dilla wanted to experiment with electronic textures. The Roots responded by moving away from the movement they helped create; their follow-up record, Phrenology, was essentially the anti-Roots album, with a heavy emphasis on rock. And while it alienated the Roots’ core fanbase, Phrenology performed well, pushing the group further into crossover territory. The Roots became a more regular presence on TV and radio. Soon after, Rahzel and Malik B. left the group for good. In 2006, Dilla died at age 32 from complications of lupus, and the Roots’ album of that year, Game Theory, kicked off a series of releases with a darker tone, including 2008’s Rising Down, 2010’s How I Got Over, and 2011’s undun. Having secured a gig as Jimmy Fallon’s backing band—first on “Late Night,” then on “The Tonight Show”—the Roots finally and completely entered the mainstream. But they used the freedom to experiment and make the music they wanted. Things go in cycles, and the approach the Roots pioneered came back around. In 2015, the “next movement” the Roots mentioned on Things Fall Apart seemed to arrive. Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly—a densely lyrical and allegorical exploration of Blackness and struggle, set to a live-jazz soundtrack featuring dozens of collaborators—is hard to imagine without this album in its rearview. Artists like Robert Glasper, Thundercat, Terrace Martin, and Kamasi Washington channel the same creativity as the Roots, D’Angelo, and company, banding together to push rap, jazz, soul, and more into atmospheric new places. The spirit of Things Fall Apart is in the air. Looking back on it now, this record feels like both a love letter and a fond farewell to the Roots’ early days, acknowledging that they needed to evolve to stay relevant. And some of the album’s continued relevance is painful. Its closing poem, “The Return to Innocence Lost,” details the fate of a young man seemingly doomed to fail since birth. He dies tragically, leaving nothing but thoughts of a life that could’ve been. Nowadays, black men are dying at the hands of police with alarming frequency, and we’re left to mourn the dead in hashtags and shared articles, wondering what’s next—or who’s next—in this seemingly endless war. Things Fall Apart imparts a similar tone, even if the band didn’t address those issues directly. The black and white cover art, taken in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn in 1965, depicts a young black woman running from a waiting police officer, her face twisted in fear. The scene is sadly familiar 50 years later. As the Roots teetered between fame and purgatory, virtue and failure, Things Fall Apart captured the intensity of a group with everything to lose and the world to gain.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22132-things-fall-apart/,MCA,1999.0
92,Frank Ocean,Blonde,Pop/R&B,9.0,August 25 2016,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"At first, Frank Ocean was simply a great storyteller. Then he became the story—an avatar for all of our fluid modern ideals. He could be the dynamic human of the future, exploding age-old binaries with an eloquent note, melting racial divisions with a devastating turn of phrase or quick flit to falsetto. He breathed hope. Then he went away. Years clicked by. It was easy to worry. There are precedents for this sort of thing, for disappearances, for the self-implosion of black genius. Lauryn Hill. Dave Chappelle. “Black stardom is rough,” Chris Rock once said. “You represent the race, and you have responsibilities that go beyond your art. How dare you just be excellent?” The Rock quote is from a 2012 profile of the reclusive D’Angelo, who felt compelled to release his first album in 14 years following the shooting of Michael Brown; the moment spurred him on. Faced with a hellish loop of police brutality, other musical leaders like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé came forth with brilliant righteousness as well. But not Frank. Though he posted several elegant messages online, reacting to horrors in Ferguson and Orlando, his relative silence only grew louder as tensions outside continued to rise. The stoic empathy he beamed throughout Channel Orange was missed. There was a yearning for his perspective—how he could soothe without losing sight of what’s important. How he allowed us to escape within his carefully drawn characters while never letting us off the hook. How his voice was allergic to nonsense, how it could shatter a heart into dust. It still can. “RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me,” he sings on “Nikes,” the opening track from Blonde, his wary exhale of a new album. In the song’s video, Frank holds up a framed photo of the 17-year-old martyr, the boy’s sad eyes tucked inside a hoodie. Even now, four years after the Florida teen was shot and killed with Skittles in his pocket, the line jolts. It’s also the most overtly political statement Frank makes across the entire record. And “Nikes” is hardly a call to arms. The song is a woozy, faded, screwed-down odyssey, replete with helium warble and dewy third eye—and it’s actually one of the album’s most propulsive tracks. On its surface, Blonde seems tremendously insular. Whereas Channel Orange showed off an expansive eclecticism, this album contracts at nearly every turn. Its spareness suggests a person in a small apartment with only a keyboard and a guitar and thoughts for company. But it isn’t just anyone emoting from the abyss, it’s Frank Ocean. In his hands, such intimacy attracts the ear, bubbles the brain, raises the flesh. These songs are not for marching, but they still serve a purpose. They’re about everyday lives, about the feat of just existing, which is a statement in its own right. Trayvon Martin would be 21 today, and Blonde is filled with feelings and ideas—deep love, heady philosophy, despondent loss—that he may have never had a chance to experience for himself. The stories Frank tells here find solace in sorrow. They’re fucked up and lonely, but not indulgent. They offer views into unseen places and overlooked souls. They console. They bleed. And yes, they cry. The power of Frank’s work often comes via extreme transparency, but he’s not writing diaries. It’s about how he’s able to locate the crux of any situation, or expose undue artifice, or peel things back to their naked core. Like how he skewed L.A. privilege without breaking a sweat on “Super Rich Kids” or broke down the Coachella generation’s bored numbness in five minutes on “Novacane.” Recently, he’s expanded this skill beyond music. It’s in the “Nikes” video, which both takes advantage of movie magic, like lighting a man (Frank?!) on fire, only to deflate the trickery by also showing the crew of extinguishers putting him out. It’s in the oversized, seven pound, coffee table magazine Boys Don’t Cry, which came out along with the new album; in it, screenshots of internet histories—perhaps the most accurate mirror of our modern selves—are on full display, along with literally naked bodies on and around his beloved sports cars, and charmingly unfiltered interviews with fellow artists and friends. (These chats can get a bit stoner-y, though amusingly so; in one, Frank asks Lil B, “is money sexy?”) And this transparency was also expressed in the current campaign’s prolonged rollout, which at one point had fans watching Frank watch paint dry as part of a live stream lead-up to a visual album called Endless. As a piece of filmed entertainment, Endless is painfully dull, and perhaps that’s the point. As we watch Frank build a spiral staircase with his bare hands, the piece offers a sort of anti-promo message that comments on how an album’s release strategy can often diminish the art it’s built to uphold nowadays. Or maybe, you know, it’s just really dull. Either way, the Endless soundtrack is much more exciting—46 minutes of music that plays like a mixtape, sliding from song to song, demo to demo, like scrolling through Frank’s hard drive of unreleased material. It’s an intriguing peek into his process, and it contains some of the rawest vocal takes he’s ever put out—like on the strung-out power ballad “Rushes”—but it lacks the clarity of Blonde. (In a neat inversion, it now looks like Frank used the relatively minor Endless to fulfill his major label contract and then self-released Blonde, the main event—though both were exclusives to Apple Music, putting into question what “self-released” even means at this point.) With Blonde’s unobtrusive instrumentation—large swaths go by without any drums whatsoever—the album could be mistaken for background music. But then Frank’s voice enters, and the overall quietness turns into a soft spotlight, capturing attention. It’s a technique pioneered by noted minimalists like Brian Eno and Rick Rubin, both of whom are included in Blonde’s who’s who list of contributors and inspirations. Many tracks feel emptied, with only the plain strumming of an electric guitar or foggy atmospherics left behind. But they mesmerize. Even a song like “Nights,” which sounds straightforward at first with its shards of silvery chords and midtempo beat, eventually turns into a strange shredding solo before ending with what sounds like a Drake dream heard underwater. “Nights” is not an anomaly. It’s the album’s centerpiece, by an artist who is following nobody but himself. Frank is 28 now, and his voice has grown stronger and more dexterous, while some of his tales have become more abstract. “Skyline To” is essentially a tone poem about sex, summer, and California haze backed by mood and mystery. “Godspeed” nods to gospel but stays grounded in its prayer to steadfast but broken love; a short story in the magazine, also called “Godspeed,” reads like uncanny science fiction but is actually based on Frank’s boyhood. Certain things are clear, though. The big questions are on his mind. He’s aware of his mortality now. He’s thinking about families, about what it means to live outside society, whether that’s a sustainable goal. He contemplates settling down with “two kids and a swimming pool” on “Seigfried,” a song that works in words by Elliott Smith and ends with a spaced-out soliloquy about living life in the red before a random solar flare brings chaos unto earth. This is not light fare. But the touch is oh so feathery. On “Solo,” he contemplates various stages of singledom, from the jacket-throwing hedonism to the smoked-out emptiness, with nothing but a churchly organ backing him up. It’s a stunning piece of songwriting that ultimately finds some peace with being alone. It sounds like a friend. Later on, “Solo (Reprise)” marks the album’s only major vocal guest appearance, with a devastating, head-spinning verse from André 3000. It pinpoints one of Blonde’s major themes: nostalgia. André looks back on his 20 years in hip-hop and feels duped by rappers who don’t write their own rhymes. “I’m hummin’ and whistlin’ to those not deserving,” he says, amid a conclusion that will likely haunt Drake’s nightmares for years. “I’ve stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?” There is disappointment in his voice, and some bitterness. André’s disillusionment could be a cautionary tale for Frank, who often uses the album as an opportunity to look back with a rosy tint: climbing trees, Michael Jackson, cannonballs off the porch, Stevie Wonder. It makes sense for an artist who titled his first major project Nostalgia, Ultra. when he was only 23. Longing looks good on him, though, especially when he’s able to harness it to aching effect on “Self Control” and “White Ferrari,” songs that fight off despondency with a sadness that feels three-dimensional. The album ends with a final look in the rearview, in the form of spliced-up old interviews with some of Frank’s young friends as well as his brother Ryan, who was around 11 at the time. A cozy keyboard rolls in the background as the boys talk about who they are and what they wish for. Carefree laughs—the kind that adults can’t seem to utter—are looped. Harsh static constantly intrudes, though, hinting at the distortions of time. These brief talks are also transcribed in the magazine alongside photos, and when asked about his dream superpowers, Ryan says, “I want to be invisible, I want to fly, and I want to be invincible.” His bright eyes peer out from under a Supreme cap and pink bandana. He looks like he might pull it all off.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22295-blonde-endless/,"Self-released,Def Jam",2016.0
93,Stevie Wonder,Songs in the Key of Life,Pop/R&B,10.0,August 21 2016,Alan Light,Contributor,"Stevie Wonder’s legacy ranks among the most powerful in pop music, though his story remains elusive. His songwriting and his voice echo through virtually all R&B-related sounds that have followed him, from Michael Jackson to R. Kelly to Kanye West, yet there is no major biography, no documentary, nothing that presents the full sweep of the most dominant and defining artist of the 1970s. And make no mistake—it was an era of superstar acts and chart-busting albums, but no one was as universally loved, respected, and honored as he was. To be sure, Wonder has done himself no favors in getting his story told. Long ago, the media figured out that his world runs on “Stevie Time,” that schedules and deadlines don’t apply to this towering genius, whether that means showing up for an interview or delivering an album. “You set a goal in your mind,” he told me in 2005, when the record A Time to Love was released after many years’ delay, “and you say, O.K., this is what these songs need to have, this project needs to have, and you don't really settle for anything less than that.” As good as his word, Wonder has not put out a new album since. But even Stevie Wonder realized that there was one project of his that demanded to be recognized and appreciated while he was still able, and in 2014 he mounted a tour to present, in full, his 1976 magnum opus *Songs in the Key of Life, *which turns 40 next month. The album—two LPs plus an additional four-song EP—was the culmination of a historic period of creativity, a concentrated burst of music matched only by a handful of artists (mid-’60s Bob Dylan, early ’70s Rolling Stones, ’80s Prince). Its ambition and scope were unprecedented, its power and resonance were timeless—and when it was done, he never approached its caliber or impact again. In 1971, a decade into an already-legendary career, Wonder celebrated his 21st birthday by allowing his contract with Motown Records to expire, holding out for a new deal which gave him a higher royalty rate and creative control over his work. He responded with two albums in 1972, the breakthrough Music of My Mind and his first true masterwork, Talking Book. His next releases, 1973’s Innervisions and Fulfillingness’ First Finale in 1974 (which followed a serious automobile accident that left him in a coma for four days) won back-to-back Album of the Year trophies at the Grammys. Wonder not only reeled off six Top Ten hits in three years and repeatedly pioneered new frontiers in music technology (he introduced the Moog synthesizer and the sampler to the public), he also established himself as a leading voice of social protest with such profound commentaries as “Living for the City” and “You Haven’t Done Nothing.” And then came the wait. Wonder, expressing frustration with America in the aftermath of Watergate and the never-ending war in Vietnam, had started to talk about quitting the music industry and moving to Ghana to work with handicapped children. He got as far as starting to make plans for a farewell concert. Instead, though, in August of 1975, he signed a new contract with Motown—a seven-year, seven-album, $37 million agreement, the largest deal made with a recording star up to that point. Though there were murmurs about an album release later that year, Wonder first took time off, then kept adding songs to the stockpile he had amassed, then decided there was more mixing and post-production required. Two years might not seem like a long break between records now, but at the time, it was unheard of, especially from the biggest star in the game. Motown staffers printed up T-shirts that read, “We’re Almost Finished.” And when the twenty-one-song set was finally released on September 28, 1976, the promotional campaign borrowed some pages from the playbook for the previous year’s record-shattering movie Jaws, which had redefined the making and meaning of a true blockbuster. Motown flew press and everyone who had worked on the album to the Long View Farm studio in Massachusetts for the first playback and a battery of interviews with Wonder, presenting everybody with autographed copies of the album. As it made its way to record stores, Songs in the Key of Life (changed from the working title Let’s See Life the Way It Is) was everywhere you looked. I distinctly remember what a major event the release was, and I was only 10 years old at the time. Yet this was the very rare case in which there was simply no way to overhype the music. The sound drew effortlessly from funk, pop, jazz, Latin styles. Tracks ranged from the fusion groove of “Contusion” to the delicate voice-and-harp duet “If It’s Magic.” Though more than 130 musicians are listed in the credits (including such stars as Herbie Hancock, George Benson, and Minnie Riperton), Songs in the Key of Life never strays from the singular, blazing vision of one artist. The sneaky pre-chorus in “Knocks Me Off My Feet,” the transcendent, spiraling rise of “As”—hooks pile on top of hooks, tucked irresistibly and unerringly into breaks, fills, and intros, most obviously on the album’s two biggest hits, the nostalgic, swaggering “I Wish” and the shout-out to Wonder’s jazz forefathers (and mothers) “Sir Duke,” soon to take up permanent residence in the repertoire of every marching band in the country. The hat tip to Duke Ellington was significant, since in some ways Songs in the Key of Life most recalled that composer’s classic long-form works like “Black, Brown, and Beige” (or Max Roach’s Freedom Now Suite or Charles Mingus’ “Pithecanthropus Erectus”) in its attempt to portray the complete sweep of the Black American experience. The album’s opening lines—“Good morn or evening friends/Here’s your friendly announcer/I have serious news to pass on to everybody,” from the almost impossibly gorgeous “Love’s in Need of Love Today”—laid out the stakes for all that would follow. “Village Ghetto Land” spoke of the pain and indignity of poverty and homelessness. “Black Man” served as a literal history lesson, calling out examples of how all colors and cultures have contributed to global progress. “Ngiculela—Es Una Historia—I Am Singing"" soared triumphantly in Zulu, Spanish, and English, with melody easily uniting all languages. Then there were the simple celebrations of love and faith—on “Isn’t She Lovely,” the magic of birth and family—emotions shared by all, but never to be taken for granted in undervalued Black lives. The year 1976 was, of course, America’s Bicentennial year, and especially at a time of such frustration and distrust surrounding the government and the country’s institutions, U.S. residents were bombarded with stories of our history and heroics. Songs in the Key of Life functioned as a corrective, a counter-narrative, alongside such other radical, groundbreaking statements as Richard Pryor’s Bicentennial Nigger and Alex Haley’s Roots, both of which were released just a few weeks before the album. Almost everyone understood the magnitude of Wonder’s achievement, but there were some objections, mostly having to do with the length and sprawl of the record. “[I]t has no focus or coherence,” wrote Vince Aletti in a wildly mixed but mostly favorable review in Rolling Stone. “The eclecticism is rich and welcome, but the overall effect is haphazard, turning what might have been a stunning, exotic feast into a hastily organized potluck supper.” But to complain about the excess was to miss the point—any great double-album (The White Album, Exile on Main Street) could easily be edited into something tighter and more consistent, but the all-encompassing aspiration is the whole idea, the desire to contain multitudes and to cover as much ground as possible during a revved-up creative groove. Sometimes, more is more. Certainly, the public understood. Songs in the Key of Life entered the album charts at No. 1, only the third record to hit that spot straight out of the gate (after Elton John’s two previous releases). It then stayed there for the rest of the year; to understand just how ubiquitous the music of the mid-’70s could be, consider that it knocked Frampton Comes Alive! out of the No. 1 slot, and was finally bested in January of 1977 by Hotel California. Inevitably, Wonder won his third straight Album of the Year award at the Grammys (he missed the ceremony because he was visiting Nigeria at the time). After Songs in the Key of Life, though, something seemed to deflate in Stevie Wonder’s work. It was as if, at the ripe old age of 26, he was bored by the idea of just writing hit songs. His next album was 1979’s mystifying, experimental, mostly instrumental Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants, a double-album soundtrack to a documentary about the feelings of greenery and flowers. Turning his attention to the crusade for a national holiday to honor Martin Luther King, Jr., Wonder rebounded with Hotter Than July in 1980 (featuring the sublime “Master Blaster (Jammin’)),” but since then, it’s mostly been long waits in between underwhelming new records. It was like there was nowhere left to go after Songs in the Key of Life—and maybe there wasn’t. The album was more than just a masterpiece; it was the culmination of all of the potential that Stevie Wonder showed since his days as an 11-year-old prodigy. Musically, politically, culturally, it was the fulfillment of everything that Motown and the ’60s soul revolution had promised. And within a few months, disco was the focus for new Black music, while in the parks and playgrounds of the Bronx and beyond, hip-hop was taking shape for the next generation. The sound of Songs in the Key of Life never stopped reverberating. Elton John and Prince said that it was their favorite album. Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston sang its praises. Coolio, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, and Will Smith sampled its hooks. Mary J. Blige and Luther Vandross covered its songs. Kanye West said in 2005, around the release of Late Registration, “I'm not trying to compete with what's out there now. I'm really trying to compete with Innervisions and Songs in the Key of Life. It sounds musically blasphemous to say something like that, but why not set that as your bar?” Still, it was a genuine event when Stevie Wonder decided to take Songs in the Key of Life to the stage 38 years after its release, and bring the spotlight back to his greatest musical accomplishment. It required several dozen musicians on stage to recreate the album’s arrangements, with full horn and string sections (that harp!), but it also imposed a discipline on Wonder’s performance, which too frequently devolve into a mess of medleys and sing-alongs. The shows were magnificent, the words as true as ever, and there was Stevie, still telling us—showing us—that “music is a world within itself/With a language we all understand.” Almost four decades later, you could feel it all over.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22174-songs-in-the-key-of-life/,Motown,1976.0
94,Michael Jackson,Dangerous,Pop/R&B,8.6,August 7 2016,Jeff Weiss,Contributor,"On the night of November 14, 1991, 500 million people scattered across 27 nations simultaneously watched Michael Jackson grab his crotch 17 times. He simulated masturbation, shattered car windows with crowbars, and unleashed the primal screams expected from a man who owned publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue. Then he turned into a black panther. The video ends with Bart Simpson striking a B-Boy pose in a Michael Jackson shirt, and ordering Homer to “chill out, homeboy.” It shattered all previous viewing records on Fox. The $4 million, 11-minute unedited telecast of “Black or White” ranks among the Smithsonian-worthy artifacts of ’90s pop monoculture—up there with Nirvana trashing their instruments at the ’92 VMAs, the premiere of “Summertime” after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Hillary Clinton hitting the Macarena at the ’96 DNC. No one ever had more juice than Jackson did at the time, and it’s difficult to imagine that anyone ever will again. This was right around the time when they named him an official king of the Ivory Coast. In Gabon, 100,000 greeted him with signs reading “Welcome Home, Michael.” His universal popularity was on par with pizza and the polio vaccine. Safe enough to be Captain EO at Disneyland, hood-certified enough to throw up the set with the Crips. The 33-year-old had recently signed the most lucrative contract in recording history, worth hundreds of millions, giving him his own label and the highest royalty rate in the industry. What’s more, no one thought it was out of line for someone who had sold close to 70 million records in the previous decade. In the press, Sony claimed the deal would reap them billions. So when he released the first single from Dangerous, his first album in four years, fanatical interest led MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox to televise it at the same time—offering the greatest strategic victory since the Berlin Wall tumbled two years prior. And even though Jackson technically didn’t cause the collapse of East German Communism, his star wattage was so supreme that the Stasi secret police spied on him during his 1988 Berlin concert, fearing that obsessive MJ fans would accomplish what Reagan couldn’t. With “Black or White,” Jackson lashed out at his public perception. In the interim since 1987’s Bad, he’d grappled with both outlandish rumors (buying the Elephant Man’s bones, sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber) and some that drew blood (allegations of bleaching his skin). The innocent popcorn-eating Michael of Thriller was gone, but calling him “Wacko Jacko” was slander. He wanted us to know he was a man, an eccentric sure, but an adult with deeply rooted beliefs. Released only five months before the LA Riots, the Rodney King beating and murder of Latasha Harlins almost certainly factored into Jackson’s increasingly political slant. “Black or White” articulated a utopian vision of a post-racial future while acknowledging the sins of contemporary bigotry.  He demands equality, shouting that he “ain’t second to none.” He growls, “I ain’t scared of no sheets” (presumably Klansmen). Its hook offers his dream of a color-blind society, echoing Martin Luther King. But this was Michael Jackson, not O’ Shea. Being King of Pop meant the need for mass appeal. The “Black or White” video exists as a microcosm of Dangerous itself. It potently affirms Jackson’s manhood, offers passionate screeds against racial strife, gang violence, and a parasitic American media. This is the album as multi-media spectacle, a precursor to Lemonade, with accusations of infidelity substituted for videos of Macaulay Culkin doing air guitar windmills to a Slash guitar solo and lip sync rapping about turf wars. The lone #1 single from the 32-million selling Dangerous, “Black or White” spent seven weeks atop the Billboard charts. Directed by John Landis (“Thriller,” National Lampoon’s Animal House) the first quarter of its video reveals Jackson’s mischievous child-like streak, with Culkin towing out Spinal Tap-sized speakers, amplifying the volume to “ARE YOU NUTS!?!,” and shredding so hard that George Wendt gets ejected into the stratosphere screaming “Da Bears.” It blends into his idealistic visionary side that wanted to heal the world through philanthropy and moonwalking. There is pop locking with Balinese dancers, rain dances with Native Americans, folk dances in front of the Kremlin, and the serenade of a Hindu goddess on a freeway. This is the magical Michael Jackson of our early memories—the man with the graceful dance moves and lithe falsetto that seemed celestially ordained (masking a notoriously intense perfectionist streak). Faces of all races harmoniously morph into one another, the most cutting edge FX that 1991 had to offer. In the third section, boy becomes man: Jackson struts through a wall of flames, Henley shirt open, screaming at his enemies like a mad king. It gives way to Culkin rapping in shades and oversized gold chains, which is just as well considering that this is the man who actually spit the bars. Jackson’s embrace of hip-hop not only aligned him with the popular sound of black (and white) youth culture, it adds an aggressive masculinity unseen in his catalogue, and ultimately paved the way for the late period Biggie therapy session. Of course, in the final section, Jackson turns into a black panther. You understand that meaning. So did millions of parents in Tipper Gore America, who flooded Fox and its local affiliates with phone calls, forcing Jackson’s team to re-cut and sanitize the video. A quarter century later, it seems absurd that Michael Jackson smashing a few windows before turning into a Jungle Book character could be cause for mass protest, but you have to remember how adored and family-friendly Michael Jackson was. My parents only owned two records: Thriller and *Bad. *So until I was 9 years old, I listened to those two almost every single day of my life, and honestly I didn’t really need anything else. Michael Jackson was my entire conception of music. Millions more could say the same thing. So when he dropped “Black or White,” it was shocking. If he was previously pop’s Peter Pan figure, Jackson had suddenly adopted a more carnal streak, but even here it was cartoonish. If the adult world looked dull and stifling, Jackson’s imagination offered a hope that it was possible not to wind up like George Wendt, bloated on a couch with a bored housewife. You could hang out with Macaulay Culkin, dance on top of the Statue of Liberty, and if all else failed, you could transform into a panther and bounce. Imagine being Teddy Riley in 1991. You’ve gone from humble origins in Harlem to inventing New Jack Swing; you've produced multiple hits for your own band Guy, Bobby Brown, and Keith Sweat (“I Want Her”). Then late one night, you get a phone call from Michael Jackson telling you that he needs you to produce his new album—in effect making you the new Quincy Jones. All before your 24th birthday. Before Riley headed west, Jackson had labored on* Dangerous* for over a year to varying degrees of success. Something always seemed off. Bad might have been the last album before hip-hop became the de facto soundtrack of urban culture. 1988 changed everything. Public Enemy, Rakim, and Big Daddy Kane left the competition sounding effete and timid. Gang wars and the crack epidemic continued to inflame inner cities. Songs like “Smooth Criminal” seemed obsolete. Meanwhile Jackson’s sister Janet had recently delivered a hard-stomping R&B-pop classic in 1989’s Rhythm Nation 1814. Its influence on her older brother was so great that he even asked Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis to produce Dangerous. Out of loyalty to Janet, they turned him down. According to his engineer, Bruce Swedien, Michael was searching for something “very street that young people would be able to identify with.” He wasn’t alone. His longtime competition Prince sought to re-connect in a similar fashion, forming the New Power Generation with rapper, Tony M. Released just one month before* Dangerous*, the purple one’s Diamonds and Pearls* *exists as a companion piece, documents of blurring eras. As ’80s pop gave way to ’90s hip-hop, they sought to find their place in the re-configured landscape. Except while Prince predictably constructed his own insular unit, Jackson looked outwards to Riley, the hottest producer of the moment. If that seems obvious today, it wasn’t at the start of 1991. Many mainstream artists still saw hip-hop as a passing fad or stereotyped it as nihilistic and violent. Jackson needed to walk the fine line between disposable bubblegum rap like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, and alienating longtime disciples with something too radical. After preparing grooves in Q-Tip’s Soundtrack Studio in Queens, Riley flew out to the Neverland Ranch to meet the master. There was a tour of the trophy room, the carousel, and the zoo, and then after they talked late into the night, Jackson put Riley on his personal helicopter and had him flown to the Universal City Hilton, a short distance from the San Fernando Valley studios where they recorded Dangerous. Riley began work the next day. Jackson established nerve centers at Record One and Larrabee Studios, just a few miles down Ventura Blvd. The latter had the SSL mixing console that Riley needed to make the tracks slap, and despite his pop reputation, Jackson wanted his new songs as hard as humanly possible. Engineers remember Jackson demanding that they play the New Jack Swing songs so loud that your ears bled. He invariably blew up a pair of headphones each session. As you’d expect, the recording process boasted its requisite share of idiosyncrasy. Nancy Reagan visited the studio once, requiring the Secret Service to search the place for hours prior to her visit. Brooke Shields called frequently to talk to Michael, who materialized every day in the same black dress pants and red button-down shirt (he had a clothing rack of just two items). One night, he left early to go to Tower Records, which had been shut down just for him to spend $1,500 on CDs. Another afternoon, he ordered several $900 remote controlled motorcycles brought to the studio. Despite usually eating meals prepared by a personal chef, Jackson requested McDonald’s for lunch on one occasion. He’d never actually eaten there before, but someone told him it was good, so he ordered one of everything on the menu and took a small bite of each. (The fish sandwich particularly wowed him.) Then there was Madonna. During March and April of 1991, Jackson and Madonna went out to dinner at least three times, which led tabloids to immediately report that they were dating. During these conversations, Jackson reportedly asked her to duet on the unfinished version of what became, “In the Closet.” “I think all he wanted was a provocative title, and ultimately he didn’t want the content of the song to live up to the title,” Madonna said at the time. “I said, ‘Look, Michael, if you want to do something with me, you have to be willing to go all the way or I’m not going to do it.’” His engineers remember her visiting him once at the studio, where they spent a little time in his private room in the back. “When I asked Michael later about her visit he said that she ‘scared’ him,” his engineer Rob Disner later said. “I think we all speculated that she tried to make a ‘move’ on him but Michael never said. In any event, we never saw her again.” The creative union most likely fizzled due to major stylistic divergences. Madonna imagined an extreme makeover: giving him a Caesar haircut, getting him out of his bedazzled military uniforms, taking him to New York and hanging out with the voguers, House of Xtravaganza. Michael wanted to go hip-hop and ultimately enlisted rappers Heavy D and Aqil Davidson of Wreckx N’ Effect as the principal guest vocalists. During the summer of ’91, competition broke out within the two studios and three rooms dedicated to *Dangerous. At Record One, *Bill Bottrell and Bruce Swedien worked on the album’s softer more adult contemporary material (and “Black or White”). At Larrabee, Riley handled the New Jack Swing half. Even though engineers remember the sessions as “giggly, innocent, and so much fun,” Jackson did his part to foster a friendly rivalry—bouncing back and forth between studios and taunting his teams, “Oh boy, they got some smelly jelly going on in there.” As Sony’s deadlines kept getting blown, Riley’s beats began forming the spine of the record. After being initially awestruck, Riley asserted more and more control at Jackson’s behest. “It worked itself out when he shook me,” Riley told HipHopWired in 2009. “[He was like] listen, you’re going to have to really produce me like you’ve produced a new artist. I need you to talk to me, I need you to criticize me, I need you to comment, I need you to give me all of you. I want the Teddy Riley that got that record out of Guy and the records out of your previous artists.” If Michael danced in the studio, it meant that a track sounded right. No matter what, Jackson ensured that the melodies were his own, while Riley sought to merge his trademark New Jack Swing with Quincy Jones’ baroque pop. At one point, L.A. Reid and Babyface were brought in to help produce, but none of their contributions made the final cut. Over 60 songs wound up being written over a period of 18 months. It cost $10 million in total, not counting video costs. When Jackson revealed the final tracklist to Riley, the latter expected to see his name once or twice. Instead, Riley produced six of the 14 songs—arguably all the material that has aged the best. As a result of his contributions, you can convincingly argue that Dangerous is Jackson’s final classic album and the best full-length of the New Jack Swing era. As soon as you pressed play on the tape, Riley’s drums attacked with Scud-era force. “Jam.” The sound of glass breaking, bells reminiscent of LL Cool J’s “Jingling Baby,” funky drums that knock like Clyde Stubblefield was behind the kit, and roaring saxophone licks. The words “you want to get up and jam” are initially buried in the mix, but the vocals are as acrobatic as a highlight reel, so it only made sense that the Chicago Bulls used it in their 1992 championship video. Starring Michael Jordan and Kris Kross, the “Jam” clip became almost as iconic as “Black or White.” Filmed in an abandoned rat-infested armory on the South Side of Chicago, it finds Michael Jackson teaching Jordan how to dance and the other MJ teaching him to hoop. Through the wonders of special effects, Jackson ultimately swishes shots that not even Steph Curry can hit; but not even the greatest dancer of the last half-century can teach Jordan how to dance. Point Jackson. Riley recruited Jackson’s favorite rapper Heavy D for four nimble bars, his baritone artfully offsetting the singer’s falsetto growl. The first song wastes no time in articulating the album’s leitmotif. Jackson urges the world to come together, decries false prophets crying of doom, and admits that the universe is a complicated place full of “tears for fears.” He’s “conditioned by the system” and doesn’t want to be preached to. His ultimate realization is that you have to “live each day like it’s the last,” find inner peace to stay strong against the haters, and when in doubt, jam. You can see these themes stressed on nearly every song. “Why You Wanna Trip on Me” exists as a mission statement. This is the Michael who fame has isolated and forced into retreat. There’s a newfound menace in his voice, an angelic sneer, as he recites a litany of crippling ailments (world hunger, illiteracy, disease, gangs, homelessness, drug addiction, corruption, police brutality)—and yet ironically, he has somehow become the media’s bullseye. Written during his 33rd year, Jackson can’t help but implicitly compare himself to Jesus—a popular healer who wants to help, misinterpreted and publicly crucified. But even though Teddy Riley had Jesus, Jesus never had Teddy Riley. These drums could turn stone walls to white sand, the vocals are meticulously layered, the multiple bridges leave just enough room for interpretative dance moves. Jackson adapts seamlessly to the new genre, funkier than Guy, more lyrically incisive than Bobby Brown. Without Madonna, “In the Closet” received a cameo from Princess Stephanie of Monaco, mainly because Michael liked her sultry speaking voice even though she couldn’t sing. Shot in the desert, the Herb Ritts video stars Naomi Campbell at her pret a porter peak. Michael wears a tank top with a plunging neckline. It’s probably the most erotically charged of his career, about as far from “Thriller” as Basic Instinct is to The Mask. * * You can trace Timbaland and the Neptunes experiments to a song like “She Drives Me Wild,” in which their former mentor created the percussion tracks from automotive sounds: car horns, motorcycles idling and revving, vehicles starting and screeching. This is probably Jackson’s closest attempt to match his sister’s* Rhythm Nation*. Some interpreted it as a desire to catch up, but it’s more emblematic of his lust to conquer. If Off the Wall was Jackson mastering late ’70s soul and disco, Thriller was his perfection of ’80s pop. This is Jackson showing that he could blend hip-hop and R&B better than anyone had previously imagined. The new decade starts here, with artists like Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, TLC, R. Kelly, et al. taking cues from Jackson and Riley’s alchemy. To say nothing of Kanye, Drake, and countless others still atop the charts. Dangerous has its flaws. The ballads on the back (non-Riley) half of the album could pass for gospel renditions of Celine Dion schmaltz. Despite its noble message and Jackson’s statement that it was the song he was most proud of writing, “Heal the World” is essentially “We Are The World Pt. 2.” The theme from Free Willy, “Will You Be There” offers a sweet sentiment, but it’s not exactly “I Believe I Can Fly.” “Gone Too Soon” falls into that same category of beautifully intentioned crooning that ultimately sounds like a dentist office doxology, especially when contrasted with the brilliant funk of the first side. If nothing else, they display the full range of his sharply targeted social consciousness, one that encompassed environmentalism, the AIDS pandemic, and every other affliction that still plagues the globe. In that sense, Dangerous might be Jackson’s most complete album, spanning dance music to dark nights of the soul. It’s a portrait of a persecuted genius, desperate to stay relevant, burdened with guilt and rage, lashing out at villains and offering inspiration to allies—always making it seem effortless. My favorite song on Dangerous is “Remember the Time.” Like so many others on this album, it’s inextricable from its video, which also received the MJ treatment: simultaneous premieres on MTV, Fox and BET in February of 1992. Directed by John Singleton, it stars Eddie Murphy, Iman, the Pharcyde, Magic Johnson, Tiny Lister, and some adorable striped tabbies. It’s probably the only song from Dangerous that can still go off in any club on any given night. As far as I’m concerned, it’s the greatest music video ever made, a New Jack Swing hybrid of Cleopatra and Indiana Jones. There are swirling hourglasses, busts of Pharaohs, hand drums, wriggling snakes, and Michael Jackson as a gilded wizard with dance moves so smooth that he can even elude the future Deebo. He’s so cool that steals the Pharaoh’s wife (who also happens to be David Bowie’s future wife) and then disappears into a cloud of gold dust, just as his capture seems imminent. Being a child of the ’80s and ’90s meant that Magic Johnson, Eddie Murphy, and Michael Jordan were your heroes. (Maybe you liked Larry Bird or something, but I assume if that’s the case, you’ve long stopped reading this review.) And in his videos, Michael Jackson managed to best them all, making him the undisputed King. For most of my pre-adolescence, he was a pure sorcerer, a demigod immune to the gravitational pull and perimeters that stifle the rest of us. At 10 years old, I assumed the video was shot somewhere in Egypt, because even though I no longer believed in bullshit like Santa Claus, I still accepted Michael Jackson at face value. Besides, nothing else he did seemed like it operated under any budgetary constraint. Only about a year ago did I learn that it was shot at Mack Sennett Studios in Silver Lake, a soundstage across the street from my apartment that I’d obliviously walked past thousands of times. It was one of those depressing realizations that makes much less sense than believing that Michael Jackson built a time machine and brought the star of Beverly Hills Cop, a supermodel, and the best point guard ever, along with him to the time of Ramses the Great. Watch that video again and tell me otherwise. In that same way, it’s difficult to listen to Dangerous without considering the child molestation allegations that greeted him shortly after he came home from its marathon 69-concert tour. It’s tricky not to read too much into a song like “In the Closet.” How do you reconcile that someone as pure of spirit as Jackson could potentially have a monstrous streak? Whether you believe the allegations or not, it’s clear that he was never the same after Dangerous. The damage became too absolute, the vitriol aimed his way too severe for someone that sensitive. Never again could his music exist on its own merits, the illimitable genius ravaged by prescription pills, insomnia, and obliterating pressure. Dangerous is the last time that Michael Jackson was Michael Jackson. In an interview given shortly after the release of Dangerous, Jackson said that his goal was to do “an album that was like Tchaikovsky’s ‘Nutcracker Suite.’ In a thousand years from now, people would still be listening to it…. Something that would live forever.” He’s been gone for over half a decade, but I still think about this quote every time I walk past that sound stage—considering the possibilities that Michael Jackson unlocked in every song, the infinite magic that he could create out of an empty room, the orphic visions of one of our final myths.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22044-dangerous/,Epic,1991.0
95,Snoop Dogg,Coolaid,Rap,5.8,July 25 2016,Kathy Iandoli,Contributor,"Over the decades, we’ve watched Snoop Dogg go through nearly as many costume changes as Madonna. Gangbanger Snoop, No Limit Southern-rap Snoop, pop star Snoop, “Drop It Like It’s Hot” Snoop, “Sensual Seduction” Snoop, “Snoop Lion”—sometimes those sonic and aesthetic remixes have worked, other times not so much. With Coolaid, arguably Snoop’s first *real *hip-hop album in half a decade, we find his reinvention back into “Rapper Snoop” to be a bit wobbly. On 2011’s Doggumentary, it sounded like Snoop was losing steam; much of it felt like a rehashing of previous bad ideas. “Snoop Lion” emerged shortly thereafter. By 2014, he reverted back from “Lion” to “Dogg” and dropped the plush party-funk of Bush, which toed the line of hip-hop without actually crossing it. Here on *Coolaid *we return to the Snoop D-O-Double-G, the hard, cold rhymer we met on “Deep Cover.” He hinted at this return to ferocity on the track “One Shot One Kill” with Jon Connor, from Dr. Dre’s 2015 Compton project.  That song was like a turning point-turned-duel between the old Snoop and the new Snoop, and thankfully the old Snoop won. With Coolaid, though, we reach another crossroads. A lot has changed since Rapper Snoop was at the forefront, so there is much more for him to prove here. Before he can let his skills speak for themselves, he has to first declare his status on the aptly titled opener “Legend.” Producer Bongo brings a trappish sort of beat, the kind of thing might have served another current rapper better; it’s perfect to recite three or four garbled words over. But Snoop opts instead to recite a very clear and dull laundry list of ways he's legendary. He shows us rather than tells us that on “Ten Toes Down,” where we get classic Snoop in rare form over a West Coast-leaning beat by Los. Just Blaze makes some odd production choices on “Super Crip,” which sounds like Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy” at the top before erupting into quintessential Blaze by the middle. Snoop rides those waves fairly adeptly. Pseudo title track “Coolaid Man” targets all the neophyte soundalike rappers, and at certain points you can almost hear the greys growing in Snoop’s goatee. It’s not that he’s *lying *about the extent of his influence, but for a legend who is so technically capable at seamlessly switching styles, the finger-wagging isn’t necessary. Junior partner Wiz Khalifa pops up twice: on the lukewarm “Oh Na Na” and the marginally better “Kush Ups,” where the two play perfectly well off each other’s energy. “Double Tap” carries a classic tune with E-40 and Jazze Pha, but lines like “slide off in yo DMs” make it the dadbod anthem of the year. “What If” saves the #TBT day, as fellow elder Suga Free and Snoop both bless the track with immaculate convertible-ride music. Then, when you least expect it, “Revolution” comes, and it's almost as if the rest of the 19 indifferent tracks on the excessively long Coolaid don’t even matter. Just Blaze brings a soaring, immaculate beat (on par with Beyoncé’s “Freedom”) and lo and behold, fiery Snoop arrives. The lyrics, the cadence, the anger, the pure and convincing “fuck you I'm a legend” energy. It all sounds so believable, so why did it take so long for Coolaid to get there? An entire project full of Snoop chanting that he's the greatest, and all it took was one isolated track to prove it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22167-coolaid/,"Entertainment One,Doggy Style",2016.0
96,Michael Kiwanuka,Love & Hate,Pop/R&B,6.9,July 25 2016,Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,"If you love hard enough, you’ll experience some sort of heartbreak. It’s just a thing that happens, and it doesn’t matter how many dates you enjoy or how many roses you buy. Some people will simply leave you in limbo—with lingering pain, unresolved questions and mounds of regret to sort through. It’s this same fog that permeates Michael Kiwanuka’s new album, Love & Hate, a sprawling soul opus full of longing and self-assessment. The singer sounds perplexed through its entirety, and his voice—a throaty wail the likes of Otis Redding—teeters between hope and hopelessness, perseverance and surrender. Should he stick around, or is it time to move on? And just what is he supposed to do now? Kiwanuka wrestles with these and other queries on Love & Hate, even if he never gets the answers he’s looking for. Even getting to that point has been a challenge. He won the BBC’s Sound of 2012 and was nominated for a UK Mercury Prize. Following the success of his gold-selling debut album, Home Again, Kiwanuka found himself in a weird space creatively, rubbing elbows with Kanye West, although he wasn’t sure if he belonged. At one point, West invited the UK singer/guitarist to sing on his Yeezus sessions in Hawaii and Paris. “I was lost, absolutely lost,” Kiwanuka told the London Evening Standard in May. “I just felt stupid sitting there with my acoustic guitar with all these producers and rappers. He didn’t tell me what he wanted … I wanted him to tell me what to do because I didn’t know how to do it.” Kiwanuka fuels his music with the same self-doubt, crafting nomadic tales of a man in perpetual movement and unrest. On Home Again, which combined Memphis soul and bluesy folk, Kiwanuka was the understated journeyman, thumbing through his desolation to find personal peace. For Love & Hate, Kiwanuka linked with producer Brian “Danger Mouse” Burton, best known for his work as one-half of Gnarls Barkley with Cee-Lo Green, and Broken Bells with Shins frontman James Mercer. Here, Burton brings Kiwanuka out of his shell, encouraging him to build songs from scratch in the studio, composing robust tracks that feel equally large and nostalgic. “Cold Little Heart”—the album’s 10-minute opener—is easily the record’s best song, landing somewhere between Pink Floyd’s soul/rock hybrid and Isaac Hayes’ orchestral arrangements. Throughout Love & Hate, Kiwanuka is backed by a full choir, which adds a richness not heard on his previous album. He doesn’t sound so isolated here, and the music itself feels grand and triumphant. On “Black Man in a White World,” Kiwanuka rides a jaunty Afrobeat instrumental to convey his inner racial strife: “I’m in love, but I’m still sad/I found peace, but I’m not glad.” In this instance, Kiwanuka speaks to the hearts of those who want the best out of humanity, even as the world implodes. Love & Hate is a bittersweet offering, pulling from ’60s and ’70s soul, growing more melancholy as it plays. And while it’s a creative step forward for Kiwanuka, it’s still tough to get a sense of just who he is at times. Names like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield immediately come to mind, and on “The Final Frame,” Kiwanuka’s spacious guitar chords recall Parliament Funkadelic’s Eddie Hazel. Kiwanuka takes pieces from these icons, resulting in a nice effort with occasional tedium, somewhat stalling the momentum. It’s clear Kiwanuka is still working through his angst. He'll need time to find inner tranquility.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21886-love-hate/,Polydor,2016.0
97,Fleetwood Mac,Tusk,Rock,9.2,July 17 2016,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"The autumn of 1979 was, by any reasonable accounting, a challenging time to be alive. The world felt tenuous, transitional: panicked families were fleeing East Germany via hot air balloon, China was restricting couples to one child each, fifty-two Americans were barred inside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, pending release of the Shah. It was also the year of Tusk, the album in which Fleetwood Mac, a soft-rock band second only to the Eagles in their embodiment of easy 1970s gloss, completely lost their minds. It was the band’s twelfth album, though only its third with the now-iconic lineup of guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, bassist John McVie, keyboardist Christine McVie, and singer Stevie Nicks, and it reflected a personal tumult so claustrophobic and intense it felt global in scale—an after-the-fall re-telling of catastrophic heartache and its endless reverberations. By this time, Fleetwood Mac was widely beloved for its melodic, harmonized jams, which evoked Laurel Canyon, curtains of strung beads, turquoise jewelry, pricey incense, scarves flung over floor lamps, and brandy poured into a nice glass. Despite their smooth, murmuring sound, few of the band’s records pull punches emotionally, but even compared to a cry of pain like “The Chain,” Tusk is singular. It is pocked with heartbreak, resignation, lust, hope, and deep hurt. It poses unanswerable questions. It reckons with the past, and what that past means for a future. It invariably makes some people want to lock their door, excavate half a joint from the recesses of their couch cushions, and spend the next fourteen hours contemplating the Buckingham-Nicks union as one of the great failed loves of the twentieth century. Just two years earlier, the band had released Rumours, a collection of pert and amiable love songs that sold over ten million copies and spent thirty-one weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. Rumours is presently among the top ten best-selling albums in American history, and, as of 2009, has shipped more than forty million units worldwide. It was—it remains—an album owned by people who have only ever owned eleven albums. Commercial success on that scale is, of course, a complicated thing to navigate; for Fleetwood Mac, it was presaged and then aggravated by outrageous amounts of cocaine and an awful lot of intra-band copulation. I don’t mean to be reductive about the group’s emotional dynamic, but I can’t think of another assemblage of five able-minded adults who created and survived such a preposterous tangle of romantic investments and divestments (to wit: Nicks and Buckingham, McVie and McVie, Nicks and Fleetwood, Fleetwood’s wife and former member Bob Weston, McVie and the lighting designer, and Fleetwood and Nicks’ then-married best friend—to cite just the handful of permutations known to the public). By the time *Tusk *was released, the two primary relationships sustaining the band (Christine and John’s marriage, and Lindsey and Stevie’s long-standing romance) had fully dissolved, which seemed to qualify Fleetwood Mac, in some perverse way, to go on to become one of our best and bravest chroniclers of love’s horrifying tumult. Being tasked with singing backing vocals for a song written by your ex-lover, about you, months (and eventually years) after the relationship ruptured? Hold that in mind—just how excruciating that must’ve been. Then find a video of Buckingham and Nicks performing “Silver Springs” (a song written by Nicks about Buckingham, withheld from Rumours, and later released, either cruelly or keenly, as the B-side to the single “Go Your Own Way,” a song written by Buckingham about Nicks) and try not to lose your mind completely when, as if to narrate the precise mechanics of their break-up, Nicks announces: “I’ll begin not to love you… Tell myself you never loved me.” It’s “Silver Springs,” more than any other track in the band’s pre-Tusk discography, that tells the story of how Buckingham and Nicks lost each other, and, ergo, the story of Tusk; performing the song live, they frequently end up locked in a kind of tense combat stance. When Nicks’ cool, steady voice begins to dissolve into something feral and nearly deranged (“Was I just a fool?” she finally hollers) she’ll often take steps toward him. He always meets her gaze, calmly, and with determination. Maybe they’re putting us all on, but there’s something in those moments that makes True Love—the preposterous, fairy-tale kind, the sort that never resolves itself, that can’t be outrun or eschewed, not ever, not after decades, not after a lifetime—seem entirely possible, even to the most hard-boiled cynics. I bring this up because it’s the only explanation I can think of as to how the band kept going, despite what must’ve seemed, to anyone watching, like a cataclysmic implosion. True Love doesn’t care if your relationship ends; it remains, it buoys you. If Rumours was the band’s break-up record, Tusk covers arguably even more complicated ground: how to transform a romantic partnership into a purely creative one, while remaining mindful of all the perilous ways in which love nurtures art, and vice-versa. That the band did this at all, much less successfully, much less good-naturedly—in promotional photos for Tusk, Nicks is pictured resting her left hand disconcertingly close to a bulge in Buckingham’s blue jeans—is dumbfounding. The result is a beautiful and terrifically strange album. From the outset, Buckingham was insistent that the band not churn out a sequel to Rumours. His was a defensive, contrarian pose: Let’s deliberately not recreate that colossal commercial and critical success; let's instead do something different, artier, less bulletproof, more experimental, more explicitly influenced by punk and new-wave, and less indebted to pop. Tusk contains twenty songs and is seventy-two minutes long. It retailed for $15.98 (or $52.88, in 2016 dollars). Its terrifically unattractive cover features a grainy, off-center photograph of a disembodied foot getting chomped on by a dog. The title is a euphemism for cock. Its sequencing is plainly insane, seesawing between two equally manic moods: “Everything is totally going to be fine!!!” and “This plane is going down and we’re all going to die!!!” Tusk took thirteen months to make, and was the first record to amass production costs of over a million dollars. It was called self-indulgent, and it is. Legends abound regarding the details of its composition and recording. Nicks described their space in Studio D as having been adorned with “shrunken heads and leis and Polaroids and velvet pillows and saris and sitars and all kinds of wild and crazy instruments, and the tusks on the console, like living in an African burial ground.” Everyone agrees Buckingham was losing it a little—that he was chasing something (artistic greatness? avant-garde credibility?) and pursuing it wildly, haphazardly, like a crazed housecat stalking a black fly about the living room. Did he really have a drum set installed in his bathroom so he could play while on his toilet? (More reasonable minds have suggested he merely liked the acoustics in there.) One solid argument against *Tusk—*though it could also be levied against *Rumours—*is that it lacks narrative coherence, in part because it features three songwriters (Nicks, Buckingham, and McVie), each working in their own distinct style. Still, while Nicks and McVie contributed some truly lovely tracks—“Sara,” “Beautiful Child,” “Think About Me”—the record clearly belongs to Buckingham, who wrote nearly half its songs, insisted upon its scope, and is its unquestionable spiritual center, the hamster on its wheel. The engineer Ken Caillat described Buckingham as “a maniac” during the sessions. He said it without equivocation. “The first day, I set the studio up as usual. Then he said, ‘Turn every knob 180 degrees from where it is now and see what happens.’ He’d tape microphones to the studio floor and get into a sort of push-up position to sing. Early on, he came in and he’d freaked out in the shower and cut off all his hair with nail scissors. He was stressed.” At one point, Buckingham insisted that the band rent out Dodgers Stadium, and arranged to have the 112-piece U.S.C. Marching Band back them on the title track (his bandmates went along with this; none of the group’s foundational romantic relationships were intact, but Tusk still couldn’t have been made by people who didn’t trust one another implicitly). “Why don’t you tell me what’s going on? Why don’t you tell me who’s on the phone?” Buckingham and Nicks chant, their voices paranoid. Buried somewhere in there is a riff that could have sold a zillion cassingles, had this been 1977. But it wasn’t. Though Tusk’s most memorable tracks are also its strangest (like “The Ledge,” a manic, pitter-pattering kiss-off in which the band’s signature harmonies are overridden by a guitar that’s been tuned down and turned up), there are a handful of songs that harken back to Rumours’ rich palatability. “Save Me A Place” plays like an extension, at least lyrically, of “Go Your Own Way,” in which Buckingham begrudges his lover’s unwillingness to grab what he’s half-offering her.  A lot of Buckingham’s lyrics from the late ‘70s seem to simultaneously admit trepidation and cast him as the aggrieved party; he seems, in an endearing way, oblivious to his own caveats, or how they might dissuade another person. “Guess I want to be alone, and I guess I need to be amazed/Save me a place, I'll come running if you love me today,” he sings on “Save Me A Place.” He later described the song as vulnerable. “None of us had the luxury of distance to get closure… It’s about a feeling that’s been laid off to one side and maybe not been fully dealt with, sadness and a sense of loss.” It captures the wildness of recovery: what happens when love dissipates, and you have to find a new thing to believe in? What if that thing is work? Buckingham funneled all of his disorientation into these songs. Tusk is, more than anything else, a document of that feeling and that process—of bewilderment turning into ambition writ large. What happens when a complicated, wounded person grows exhausted and unimpressed by the commercial medium he took to naturally, maybe even instinctively, but no longer believes is important or curative? It’s not hard to imagine the voice of Buckingham’s internal foil during these sessions, whispering seedily, naysaying each new melody, pushing for more: “This is fine, but it’s not Art.” I don’t know anyone who cares about making things who hasn’t at some point lobbed the exact same challenge at themselves: Can’t you do better? Hasn’t someone done this before? Haven’t you done this before? You get the sense of a broken-down person trying to rebuild himself. He is diligent about getting the architecture right. All of which makes “I Know I’m Not Wrong”—the first song the band started recording for Tusk, and the last one to be finished – even more poignant. When Tusk was reissued, in 2015, the expanded release included six (!) different “I Know I’m Not Wrong” demos, all recorded by Buckingham in his home studio. The chorus is a declaration of intention, of confidence: “Don't blame me/Please be strong/I know I'm not wrong.” It’s not a thing a person gets to say very often. But Tusk isn’t a record that gets made more than once.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21924-tusk/,Warner Bros.,1979.0
98,Betty Davis,The Columbia Years 1968-69,Pop/R&B,6.8,July 15 2016,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"In February 1968, Durham, North Carolina’s Betty Mabry released a 7”—“Live, Love, Learn” b/w “It’s My Life”—that received limited distribution and even more limited airplay despite a pop-friendly arrangement by Hugh Masekela. Five years later, she re-emerged on record as Betty Davis and released a string of LPs more renowned for their outrageousness and rawness than their commercial success, a swing apparently too far in the other direction for the general public. Tina Turner and Alice Cooper were both big in ’73, but imagine the former howling and sneering like the latter and it’s easy to understand both why Davis startled both sides of the funk/rock line she stood astride, and why later enthusiasts of underdog artists took to her like a great lost icon. Betty’s relationship with and eventual marriage to Miles is renowned for the effect she had on him: At 22, she got the pop-detached Miles into the giants of psychedelic rock, including Jimi Hendrix, that would revitalize his inspiration and lead to his revolutionary electric period. Betty wasn’t just a scenester or a hanger-on; she was a tuned-in tastemaker with deep charisma and the kind of attitude that could’ve made her a superstar in a less-anxious world, and she was both quick to learn and driven to direct. It’s one thing that Betty got Miles into Hendrix, but another thing entirely that she got a couple of Hendrix’s fellow band members to record with her—and had them join a group that included some of the key players on Bitches Brew, the album whose name was suggested by Betty herself.  Still, Betty Davis’ story isn't quite as cut-and-dry between her Mabry years and her emergence as the woman touted as too wild for Miles—especially when you explore the actual recorded results of her and Miles’ mutual influence, as the newly unearthed sessions on The Columbia Years 1968-1969 prove. The inspiration might have radiated both ways; John Ballon’s liner notes point out as much, with Betty vividly recalling Miles as a catalyst and a mentor who’d inspire her later solo run. But her full potential wasn't realized until years after these recordings, which primarily work as a sometimes exciting, sometimes half-sketched prelude to the more iconoclastic things that’d follow in the ’70s. For a set of recordings that feature the Billy Cox/Mitch Mitchell rhythm section of the Jimi Hendrix Experience's final incarnation and some of the most revolutionary players of Miles’ electric period—Harvey Brooks, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Larry Young, and Wayne Shorter—just about everyone here, Betty Davis included, sounds like they’re just getting warmed up. This hybridized Hendrix/Miles vision of the band hadn't rehearsed prior to the recording session, and it shows: You can actually hear them start to click mid-song as early-take vamping starts to tighten up. Over the course of two sessions in May 1969, less than a week apart, the band was directed by Miles and co-signed by Betty to charge through Sly-esque funk-rock (the dizzy carousel rides of “Hangin’ Out” and “I’m Ready, Willing & Able”), a Southern-soul Ike & Tina Revue rave-up (“Down Home Girl”), and covers of Cream (“Politician,” retitled as “Politician Man”) and Creedence (“Born on the Bayou”). They’re game enough, of course, and with further time they all could’ve cut a record so undeniable that Miles’ attempts to shop the record around could’ve overcome Columbia's stated reluctance to push R&B albums. (At the very least, a little seasoning could've made them strong crossover-potential labelmates of the Chambers Brothers.) But “I’m Ready, Willing & Able”—or the ninth take of it included here—is the closest we get to evidence that it could really measure up to everybody's reputations, with Betty’s subdued-but-sharp vocals and the tight, nervy guitar/organ interplay driving things home. (The specific musicians aren’t credited from track to track, but it’s not hard to pick up the distinctly heated tones of Young’s B-3 and McLaughlin’s sharp-edged riffing.) The other tracks’ more freewheeling feel can provide a certain kick. The sweetly sung “Politician Man” is just loose enough to feel scuzzy without sounding sloppy. And the fourth-take “Down Home Girl” captures the point where the quality of the band’s jazz-guys-do-Southern-soul routine started approaching the other-way-around version that Booker T. & the M.G.’s would do two years later on Melting Pot. But you can still feel the tension of the musicians trying to make sure everything falls into place, whether it does or not, and even the Teo Macero production credit can’t hide that these songs feel like they could’ve used just a little more polish. Just not, you know, *too much *polish—the three tracks she cut with Hugh Masekela in 1968 attest to that. Betty’s interviewed in the liner notes here, and she lets slip a funny-if-awkward anecdote about leaving Hugh for Miles in both a musical and relationship sense. (As she recalls Hugh lamenting during a chance encounter at an airport: “How could you marry my idol, Betty?”) It feels like, especially through retrospective looks back from both parties, that the musical side of the relationship was rewarding but just a bit ‘off,’ with Masekela’s impending pop breakthrough via “Grazing in the Grass” foreshadowed in these tracks more than the fusion-edged township soul-jazz hybrids of his later ’60s and early ’70s were. Davis didn’t entirely fit, either: she sounds fiercely independent and iconoclastic belting out “It’s My Life” and fiercely seething on “My Soul Is Tired,” but the fact that the saccharine, string-drenched, light-headed ballad “Live, Love, Learn” was what Columbia chose for the A-side of her only single for the label points square at why Betty needed a clean break and a new start in the first place. But above all else, whether it's during the sessions with Masekela or with Miles, it’s illuminating to hear Betty Davis’ voice when she's still in the process of figuring out how to let it off the chain. She’s not the ‘nasty gal’ yet, with “Politician Man” as close as she gets to the provocateur cool she’d cultivate starting with her solo debut. That particular impression lingered, at least; an ad-libbed purr of ‘get in the back seat’ was enough to inspire Miles to title a *The Man With the Horn *cut “Back Seat Betty” more than ten years later. But it’s the studio banter included at the end of that track that hints at the deeper stuff: Miles comes in with gravelly authority to state “That’s good, ah, you can overdub that,” only for Betty to exclaim “*Overdub *that?” with all the disbelief of someone who knew exactly what she wanted. A false-start take of “I’m Ready, Willing & Able” is thrown in later, not just to pad the release to just barely over the 30-minute mark, but to show Betty in command of her vision, getting the feel for arranging and rearranging a track to work for her. These ’69 sessions were a solid start, but the real thing would come sooner—and wilder—than even anyone who’d heard this session was prepared for.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22111-the-columbia-years-1968-69/,Light in the Attic,2016.0
99,Lauryn Hill,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,Pop/R&B,9.5,July 10 2016,Carvell Wallace,Contributor,"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a declaration of independence. It is a break-up letter to the bullshit routine of dealing with men who can’t stop hurting the women who love them. And it is a love letter to the liberated self, the maternal self and to God. It is an album of junctures: Between adolescence and adulthood, between Lauryn as ⅓ of the Fugees and Lauryn as a woman on her own, between being a child and being a parent. (She conceived of the album at 22 years old, single and pregnant with her firstborn.) Musically it arrived as the conceptual confluence of three of the most powerful musical ideas in all of blackness: hip hop, Motown-era soul and reggae. Doo-wop harmonies and the flushed distortion of voices singing their pain were cast over taut snares and hard boom-baps. The lo-fi production and warm, thickly muzzled bass tones purposefully recalled vintage vinyl on a rainy Sunday afternoon. After having written for Whitney Houston, having traveled to Detroit to sit with Aretha, it makes sense that Lauryn Hill returned to look upon the Fugees and their hard, brick-city, midnight-winter rap with a newfound skepticism. Ms. Hill’s background (and perhaps her most developed skill set) lay in hip-hop, and Miseducation had the effect of putting the entire genre on blast. The mid-’90s had seen the ascendency of the genre to corporate-level sales numbers, aided in large part Bad Boy Entertainment, their bromidic disco samples and unrepentant tales of jewelry and gunplay, their rallying cry of “tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars.” Meanwhile, regional acts like N.W.A. and Geto Boys had introduced an incidental violence so extreme that it mutated into horrorcore, and even reigning king Nas, once known as the sharpest and most conscious of project prophets, had ridiculously rebranded himself “Esco” and was spinning elaborate drug tales in juvenile heist raps. The Fugees entered into this mayhem first to settle the score. But it was Lauryn Hill who came to re-educate the whole people. Soul and hip-hop aside, Miseducation is most deeply fueled, spiritually and musically, by reggae. Six years before, the release of the immensely popular Songs of Freedom boxed set pushed the Marley legacy once again forefront of urban youth culture. By 1998, every halfway-conscious hip-hop head knew at least the basics of Marley’s primary theology: That black people had been subject to centuries oppression at the hands of the un-righteous, but that God was on the side of the oppressed. This meant that you were to live in peace and love with all things, for this is part of your covenant with God, but you were also not to take no bullshit from no oppressor lying down. Ms. Hill didn’t just gain inspiration from this philosophy; she quite literally inherited it. Half of Miseducation was recorded in Jamaica at Marley’s own Tuff Gong Studios. The baby she carried was conceived with Rohan Marley, son of Bob. From this regal lineage, Miseducation strikes out with the lionhearted courage of a crusader. But it can’t stay there. Metaphors of God soldiers and Lions of Judah are good as far as they go, but they don’t go far enough. The problem is that such a worldview is fundamentally male, which is to say more ubiquitous than correct. Lauryn Hill was tasked with something more difficult than that: to walk a series of intertwined tightropes specific to young black women. To be vulnerable, but fearless. To tell the truth, but look beautiful in doing so. To be driven by love, but ready to fight. To be soft enough to mother a newborn, but hard enough to protect her family. At 23 and pregnant, she was too young to be responsible for this much. It’s just that most people didn’t notice it, because on The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, she handled these competing drives so beautifully. The first track is the hard “Lost Ones,” a resentful fuck-you over tight snares with a hook loosely based on Sister Nancy’s heavily sampled 1982 dancehall classic “Bam Bam.” The song does everything short of calling Wyclef out by name, but Ms. Hill is in full battle-rap mode, putting her former partner on every type of blast: “L been this way since creation/A groupie call, you fall from temptation/Now you wanna bawl over separation/Tarnish my image in the conversation.” While “Lost Ones” is about the dissolution of a business and artist relationship with Wyclef, “Ex-Factor” is about the loss of a personal one. Here, the approach highlights Ms. Hill’s soul mode, the instrumentation and background harmonies drawing heavily from Aretha’s Capitol sessions. It’s maybe the album’s most successful evocation of this concept, milking the two-chord chart for all its attendant melodic variants while a stellar guitar solo (still a valid trope in 1998) calls to mind Muscle Shoals session man Wayne Perkins’ rousing turn in the overdub of the Wailers’ “Concrete Jungle.” Hearts, and the men who break them, are a primary theme of Miseducation, but Ms. Hill’s implicit liberation theology elevates this commonly-visited issue to spiritual proportions. When she partners with Mary J. Blige on the affecting “I Used to Love Him,” she spells out the universal interconnectedness of heartbreaker and victim in plain terms. “I see him sometimes and the look in his eye/Is one of a man who’s lost treasures untold.” These songs are the spiritual forebears of Beyoncé’s Lemonade. The sentiment is echoed when Bey sings “When you play me, you play yourself”—why, these women ask, would you hurt a woman who is fighting for the liberation of your people? Ms. Hill’s other mode is the raw, smoky rhyme delivery on tracks like “Doo Wop (That Thing),” “Superstar,” and “Final Hour.” Somewhere around 92 bpm had become the standard tempo of golden-era East Coast hip-hop, and Ms. Hill’s flow—confident, determined, and creeping deliberately just a hair behind the beat—is absolutely resplendent at this pace. It breathes a stunning, martial life into razor-sharp bars like “And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto/Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto/Why black people always be the ones to settle/March through these streets like Soweto.” At her best Lauryn Hill flirts with legitimate prophet status, digging to her deepest to harness the power greater than herself; a power we all need to survive and overcome. She offers it to us. I’m out here, she seems to say; you can be out here, too. Even though this is when Ms. Hill is technically at her best, these songs don’t comprise the highlights of the album. The heart of Miseducation is too vast, too imperative to find its complete representation in a series of slick punchlines. This is what separates Lauryn Hill from her male contemporaries, and why it feels that the album almost demands to be more rooted in song than verse. Rather than an iteration of Nas, she is Stevie Wonder merged with Joni Mitchell over classic East Coast beats. It is true that her vocal skills are stretched to their limits on numbers like “Everything Is Everything” and “To Zion,” but what does it matter? Like the winsome classroom interludes woven throughout it, this is an album about learning to love. On “To Zion” she is breathless, learning love of God through love of her child; on “When It Hurts So Bad,” she learns (painfully) about the love others, and on the title track, she reaches the apogee of this cycle by learning love of self. “Deep in my heart,” she sings over a swell of Hathaway-esque strings, “I made up my mind to find my own destiny.” The thing about destiny, though, is that we never know what it is until it happens. Ms. Hill could not have predicted that this wildly successful album would plunge her into an ugly legal battle about credit and compensation with New Ark, the amateur production team she partnered with to make it. Her immense personal drive made it too easy to cast her in the public eye as a megalomaniac intent on hoarding all the accolades for herself. When two people who are used to being fucked over (black men and black women) get together, the collective trauma makes it highly likely that each will feel the other is taking unfair advantage. The ensuing court case, with all its finger-pointing, shady interviews, and painful depositions, took a tremendous psychic toll on Ms. Hill, whose subsequent retreat from the public eye effectively continues to this day. Bad business practices (the parties signed no agreement before work began) no doubt contributed to the squabble, but a bigger factor may have been that the 23-year-old Hill, girded up for a liberation battle, and fleeing from what she felt was an oppressive partnership with Clef and Pras, perhaps believed that everything she made from that moment forward, for justice’s sake, belonged entirely and exclusively to her. On Miseducation, Lauryn Hill demonstrates that she was one of the coldest MCs of her era. It has always been the case, however, that a woman could rhyme ridiculous and still never be considered the best of them all. In a way, it didn’t matter. Even if she wanted to, Ms. Hill could not have spent a career talking about crooked cops, gold chains and project come-ups. Being a woman meant that she had to, for a time at least, talk about the truth of her self. When your body is the very weapon of your oppression, it sometimes must be through the art of self, soul, and spirit that you create your freedom.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22035-the-miseducation-of-lauryn-hill/,"Columbia,Ruffhouse",1998.0
100,Grace Jones,Warm Leatherette,"Electronic,Rock",8.5,June 25 2016,T. Cole Rachel,Contributor,"Few human beings have so fully embodied the notion of a “singular artist” more so than Grace Jones. In the annals of pop music and fashion, there has simply never been anyone else on earth quite like her—strong, severe, and otherworldly in every way, Jones has blazed a trail through popular culture over the past four decades that remains unrivaled in terms of boldfaced originality. Warm Leatherette, Jones’ career-shifting 1980 release, gives a glimpse of the artist just as her true genius was coming into sharp focus. Having spent the ’70s essentially exploding the fashion world as a model for Wilhemina and serving as muse for the likes of Yves St. Laurent and Helmut Newton, Jones’ career as a musician was still something of a novelty. Her first three albums—Portfolio, Fame, and Muse—were fun but somewhat facile, cover-filled reflections of the druggy hedonism of the disco era, which itself was already on the wane. For someone whose very image was seen as somehow deeply transgressive, Jones’ music had not yet caught up. So it was that, while stepping into the 1980s, Jones sought about drastic change and creative rebirth. In doing so, her next body of work would also reflect the blossoming radicalism of pop’s new wave—music that would upend the staid conventions of nightlife, feminist politics, and tired ideas about sexuality. Released in May of 1980, Warm Leatherette was the first release in what is known as Jones’ Compass Point Trilogy. Recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, the album finds Jones working alongside Island Records’ then president, Chris Blackwell, and producer Alex Sadkin. Her backing band—which she would lovingly describe as “the united nations in the studio’’—included Sly and Robbie as her rhythm section, as well as a crack team of session musicians that involved keyboardist Wally Badarou, guitarists, Mikey “Mao” Chung and Barry “White” Reynolds, and percussionist Uziah “Sticky” Thompson. Dubbed the Compass Point All Stars, this crew of ace musicians would go on to provide chill vibes for everyone from Tom Tom Club to Joe Cocker, but it was the group’s groundbreaking work with Grace Jones—and the dubby, Caribbean aesthetic they immersed her with—that would make for some of the most defining music of her career. Stripped of disco’s goofier affectations, Warm Leatherette was alternately more sanguine and more severe—a bracing confluence of reggae, new-wave, and post-punk that showcased Jones’ range as a performer and her uncanny, occasionally perverse vision as an interpreter of other people’s songs. Of the three records that Jones recorded at Compass Point, it would ultimately be 1981’s Nightclubbing that would rightly go down as the stone cold classic, but Warm Leatherette, while perhaps not as pioneering, still sets a high mark in terms of both inventiveness and musicality. Of the album’s eight tracks, seven are covers, though the material covered couldn’t ostensibly be more schizophrenic. Songs by the Pretenders (“Private Life”), the Marvelettes (“The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game”), Tom Petty (who actually contributed an additional verse for Jones to sing on her version of “Breakdown”), and Roxy Music (“Love Is the Drug”) all get reworked here, with mostly excellent results. The album opens with Jones’ take on the Normal’s “Warm Leatherette”—a J.G. Ballard inspired narrative about sex as car crash that, in Jones’ hands, manages the weird feat of being both abjectly funky and oddly frightening. It’s a trope that carries throughout the record, with Jones’ unmistakable sing/speak imbuing every track with an intense gravitas—equal parts self-assurance and menace. Leatherette’s most defining characteristic is the way that the power dynamics in these songs are neatly subverted, particularly in regards to the songs that were previously sung by men. “Love Is the Drug” loses its original blasé chicness to become something entirely more urgent and potently literal, while Jones’ take on “Breakdown” deflates the somewhat creepy male-delivered directive of the original (“Breakdown, go ahead and give it to me”) and replaces it with something altogether more empowered. Hearing Jones purr the lyric, “I'm not afraid of you running away/Honey, I’ve got the feeling you won’t” the line becomes more than a simple observation, it carries the weight of an implied threat. The album track that most compellingly predicts the genius to come on Nightclubbing is Jones’ take on the Pretenders’ “Private Life.” The original, which served as Chrissie Hynde’s punk-informed take on reggae, is perfect fodder for Jones, who ratchets up the drama in the lyrics and turns the whole thing into fine art. “Yes, your marriage is a tragedy,” she growls, “But it’s not my concern/I’m very superficial/I hate anything official.” The spectral dub provided by the Compass Point All Stars points in the direction of Nightclubbing’s best tracks and the “My Jamaican Guy” swagger of 1985’s Island Life. What sells the song so effectively is not necessarily the power of Jones’ voice, but rather the power of Grace Jones herself. As she would go on to prove in later efforts, it was the monolithic force of her personality—imperious, feral, queer in the truest sense of the word—that would make these songs so compelling. She is, to put it simply, impossible to ignore. In regards to this particular reissue, the extras provided on the two-disc set are nice but hardly essential. Mostly we just get “long versions,” “single versions,” and the occasional “dub versions” of the existing album tracks, none of which stray too far from the originals— other than that they are much longer. (Still, hearing eight-minute long, tripped out versions of “Private Life” and “Love is the Drug” is hardly a bad thing). One of the reissue’s best treats, however, is the inclusion of Jones’ fantastically demented cover of Joy Division’s “She’s Lost Control,” presented here in three different versions. It might have been deemed too weird to be included on the album at the time, but you’d be hard pressed to find another recorded document that so thoroughly exhibits Grace Jones’ particular form of genius. Originally released as a B-side to “Private Life” in 1980, “Control” is gloriously unhinged. Taking the liberty of changing the lyrics to first person, Jones transforms the song from a document of unraveling into a statement of defiance: “To the voice that told her when and where to act/She said, I’ve lost control.” Ironically, even in a song about losing your shit completely, Grace Jones is always the one in calling the shots.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22014-warm-leatherette/,"Island,UMG,Island,UMG",1980.0
101,Flume,Skin,Electronic,6.4,June 2 2016,Stacey Anderson,Senior Editor,"The universe opened quickly for Flume, the 24-year-old Australian DJ/producer born Harley Edward Streten: his debut album topped the ARIA charts, Lorde and Disclosure enlisted him for remixes, and mud-caked crowds have strained to glimpse him at Coachella and Lollapalooza. And with that rise, he’s become something of a dance music Rorschach test: either he’s posited as mainstream electropop’s next great hope, or he deepens the frowns of those fatigued by rave culture ubiquity and personifies all that is frivolous about it. (The Guardian recently brushed him aside with, “Oh, great! Just what the world has been waiting for,” a pessimism that leans toward the Woody Allen school of astronomy.) It’s no wonder, on his second album, Flume says he aimed to write a track that sounds “like the fabric of the universe tearing ”—all that weight was cramping his shoulders. Skin, the record in question, aims for that level of grandiosity throughout. It’s a stadium-sized upsell of Flume’s prior atmospheric formula—skittish beats that cleave easily to gruff rappers and R&B sopranos alike, rattling future-bass warp, undulating synths—that swells with energy but spills over edges. Here, Flume recruits an array of famous guests (Beck, Little Dragon, Vince Staples, Raekwon, AlunaGeorge), padding their radio-friendly cuts with the persistent crescendos of his self-titled debut, then ballasting them with loose instrumental interludes. The sum suggests that he’s an earnest collaborator, flashier but still casting around for a distinct identity. Flume has a fondness for female voices singing in their upper register. On his first album, that role was played by Jezzabell Doran on the album’s best cut (“Sleepless”). Here, it’s handled twofold by Aluna Francis of AlunaGeorge (the groggy, glitchy “Innocence”) and also Kučka, a young Aussie singer who distinctly echoes Francis in slinky R&B phrasing and tinny topnotes. The halting, futurist beat of Kučka’s solo track (“Numb & Getting Colder”) nods to Flying Lotus and Four Tet; that core is closely repeated on her second turn, “Smoke & Retribution,” which jolts awake in agile verses by rapper Vince Staples. The lead single, “Never Be Like You,” is already a Disclosure-remixed pop hit (and a winking psychotropic video); it saunters on Flume’s languid trap drops and a plummy R&B hook from the Canadian singer Kai, a former Jack Ü collaborator who trills a mundane mea culpa with a gleam of defiance. (“I’m only human can’t you see/I made, I made a mistake/Please just look me in my face/Tell me everything’s OK”). There’s a mathematical quality to how he deploys singers in these productions, where the heavier his low-end distortion throbs, the more featherweight smoke curls follow. Snuck in at the close, “Tiny Cities,” featuring Beck, is comparatively minimalist, a welcome smattering of downtempo new wave synths. Here, the production is as nimble as the vocalist; Beck opens in staccato leaps, chipper despite the Sea Change-like refrain of despondency (“it was never perfect, never meant to last”), and Flume loops him in a slow, roiling momentum until the sentiment blooms into a battle-scarred catharsis worthy of a John Hughes soundtrack. There’s one betrayal of Flume’s busy hand in the song, in a dubstep-lite drop halfway, but it’s energizing. The delicate ebb that follows it—complete with falsetto from Beck, naturally—is the most vulnerable moment of the album. Skin’s other cameos don’t approach that humanity: Little Dragon’s “Take a Chance” buckles under an erratic beat that feels determined to remix itself twice over, and Tove Lo’s lilt sounds harried on “Say It,” though her chorus does generously provide your next Tinder icebreaker (“let me fuck you right back”). Against this, the instrumentals can be hesitant, as if waiting patiently for a vocalist to drop by—“Pika” stretches out a fragment of a SBTRKT-like soul murmur, and “Free” pushes the repetitive yet determined synth runs of a keytar gained sentience. But there is one glimpse of intriguing extroversion in Flume’s standalones: “Wall Fuck,” the musician’s aforementioned attempt to rip the universe a new one, which delivers a hell of a rubbery, electrohouse-inflected bass and snarls a sliver of ghostly female coos into a strange, invigorating banger. It’s short and snappy, gone too fast in an album that could’ve been streamlined to let moments like it shine. But maybe it’s the sound of floodgates opening.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21921-skin/,"Transgressive,Mom & Pop,Future Classic",2016.0
102,David Bowie,Changesonebowie,Rock,8.8,May 24 2016,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,"It's easy enough to think there's no need for a reissue of Changesonebowie, the original David Bowie hits compilation, in 2016. In the 40 years years following its initial 1976 release, it has effectively been written out of Bowie's active discography, banished from the catalog after a rush-released 1984 CD. Changesbowie, a 1990 revision designed for compact disc, swapped out the original hit version of  “Fame” for a remix but otherwise presented a thorough overview of Bowie's hit-making peak, setting the stage for a flood of digital-era compilations that reworked the same territory. The most recent of these was the shape-shifting 2014 set Nothing Has Changed but 2002's double-disc Best of Bowie is something of a standard bearer, offering 39 hits, including all 11 songs from Changesonebowie. All these compilations have had the effect of making the original greatest hits feel antiquated: it would seem an album made redundant by history. And, yet, Changesonebowie is an important record in the arc of David Bowie's career—maybe not on the level of The Rise & Fall of Ziggy Stardust & the Spiders From Mars or Low, but it isn't a stretch to say that the album is partially responsible for cementing Bowie's stardom. When Changesonebowie first appeared in May of 1976, Bowie was four years removed from his Ziggy Stardust-fueled UK breakthrough, but he had only recently cracked the U.S. market, with “Fame” hitting number one in 1975. He'd remain in the Billboard Top 10 with Young Americans and Station to Station and, this, the compilation that closed the curtain on the first act of his career. Bowie would soon decamp to Berlin to reinvent himself as an electronic art-rocker, but Changesonebowie isn't especially interested in his progressive side. Some freakiness lies on its margins—the interstellar folk of “Space Oddity,” the coy sexuality of the non-LP single “John, I'm Only Dancing”—but the anchors here are the heavy rockers: “Ziggy Stardust” and “Suffragette City,” “The Jean Genie,” “Diamond Dogs” and “Rebel Rebel.” Riffs rule all, so loud and hooky they obscure whatever faint hint of camp there may lay underneath Mick Ronson's guitars. Those suggestions of a stranger world—all the allusions to aliens, tramps and zombies—are faint transmissions from the depths of the individual albums, but what's here is Bowie at his simplest. This is quite deliberate. He chose the tracks for Changesonebowie, bypassing actual British hits while elevating “Ziggy Stardust” and “Suffragette City” into the canon by their mere inclusion. That's because Changesonebowie turned into a major hit upon its release. It is one of the handful of David Bowie albums to be certified as Platinum in the U.S.—it earned that distinction in 1981, five years after it went gold upon its initial release—an honor Hunky Dory, Ziggy Stardust, Station to Station, Low, and “Heroes**” all missed. Odds are Changesonebowie would be the one Bowie album that you'd find in a record collection in the '70s and early '80s, and it was designed to be that way. It was meant to be cool, stylish and accessible—as glamorous as the Tom Kelley portrait on the cover—which means Changesonebowie deliberately bypasses stranger elements. Absences are abundant, some of them puzzling from the vantage of 2016. “Starman,” his 1972 breakthrough, is absent, as are “Drive-In Saturday,” “Life On Mars?” and “Sorrow,” all singles that peaked at three on the British charts; the Top 10 “Knock On Wood” from 1974's David Live is MIA, too. Nothing from Pin Ups is here, nor is there anything from The Man Who Sold The World, not even the title track which is a modern-day standard thanks to Nirvana's MTV Unplugged In New York rendition in 1994. Yet, as this economical compilation plays, none of these tunes are missed. There's an elegance to the structure of Changesonebowie, with its near chronological sequencing lending the album a narrative: it is the story of Bowie's metamorphosis from a quizzical folkie to a conquering colossus. As Changesonebowie progresses, the music expands: the brawny glam turns ornate on the second side and then slides into soul, with the funky rhythms supplying an artful ascendance. “Golden Years” ends the compilation on a note of triumph: it plays as a celebration of the self-reinvention showcased on Changesonebowie. This moment of triumph didn't last long. He traded celebrity for art in 1977, throwing himself off the populist path Changesonebowie carves. But the record itself endured, as records do. Audiences who never found much patience of the cubist synths and uneasy aural pools of the Berlin years would find solace with the songs on Changesonebowie, whether they were heard on this old LP, a new hits collection or, most likely, on the classic rock radio that embraced these songs for the very reason they were included on the comp in the first place: these are the tracks that present Bowie at his hardest and straightest. Collected, they provide a summation of his peak as a rock star and, in some ways, remain an excellent introduction to his work: it doesn't tell you everything you need to know, but it captures Bowie's essence and repackages it as a roaring good time. That's reason enough for Changesonebowie to be back in circulation.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21896-changesonebowie/,"Parlophone,Parlophone",1976.0
103,Post Malone,August 26th,Rap,5.2,May 20 2016,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"In a post-Rick Ross rap universe, the repercussions for being outed as phony are lower than they’ve ever been. For artists on the come up, social media can be a digital journal of embarrassing missteps—think web sleuths unearthing Travis Scott’s disparaging tweets about his label boss T.I.—but in a time where catfishing can get you on a TV show, these mostly make for momentary hiccups, not career destroyers. These are ideal conditions for someone like metal-and-folk enthusiast-turned-singsong-rapper Austin Post, now known as Post Malone, to flourish. He is a rap charlatan for the digital age, and his debut mixtape August 26th is like falling down an acoustic rap cover k-hole. It's worth a quick glance back at the twisty road that led to Post Malone's career. He found ubiquity on Soundcloud last fall with the novelty single “White Iverson,” an homage to the iconic NBA guard. A year and some change earlier, though, he was Leon Dechino, an over-the-top character with a “Tim & Eric”-style surrealist comedy music video called “Why Don’t You Love Me.” The song was created with help from his friends at TeamCrafted, a collective of gamers dedicated to playing and making tutorials for the sandbox game Minecraft. (In one of their videos, Post seems to denounce the song, saying “That’s it. That’s the one song. I’m done making music.”) Before that, he was playing Bob Dylan covers as Austin Richard. As a teen, he was in a hardcore band, a move spurred on by his love of the game Guitar Hero. It isn’t impossible for him to be all of these things at once—hardcore punk, satirist musician, folk singer, diehard gamer, and flex rapper—but there’s something a little disingenuous about going from prodigal son of the Dallas Cowboys corporate infrastructure to a cornrow-wearing, grill-bearing poster boy for appropriation. When asked about his place in the rap world in an interview with The Fader, he all but admitted this, saying, “At 40 years old, I'm gonna be a country singer. That's down the line.” Even if you were to overlook his questionable origins entirely, it's difficult to excuse his shortcomings as a songwriter. Every song is a rap-cliche house of cards, built on some some basic variation on ""balling"": how he's doing it, who he's doing it like, how you aren't doing it. On “Monte,” the spiritual sequel to “White Iverson,” named for Indiana Pacers guard Monta Ellis, he gets outrapped by Lil Yachty, of all people.  He has no legible personality outside the confines of ""marginally famous person excited to trade fame for sex"": On “Get Wit U,” he raps, “Wanna Fuck? I’m almost famous”; on “Never Understand,” he raps, “Said they see me at the show, they was in the front row/ They wanna fuck, I told them bitches come and jump on my bus.” The moments where Post Malone finds the most success on August 26th are when he highlights his schizoid background instead of trying to hide it. His cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” takes liberties with the melodies and structure before melting down into a backbone for the haunting thumper “Come Down.” The closer, “Oh God,” sounds like it could soundtrack a modern spaghetti western with chords that crunch under his distorted croons. Additionally, the 2 Chainz-featuring “Money Made Me Do It” is a nice tribute to slain Atlanta rapper Bankroll Fresh with floating harmonies that settle just below the surface of steel drum synths. Malone's redeeming trick is his way with melody, and some of them are enchanting, particularly on the Jeremih duet “Fuck,” which vague alludes to the Chicago singer’s “Fuck U All The Time.” The bulk of the production comes from the Atlanta duo FKi, the team behind songs like Travis Porter’s “Make It Rain,” Travis Scott’s “Sloppy Toppy,” the Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug duet “Get TF Out My Face,” and more recently 2 Chainz’s “Watch Out.” A lot of the beats do fun things with hollowed-out synths and dribbling hi-hat patterns, but there isn’t nearly enough firepower to overcome Post’s verses, which are a series of dead-end signs. It's hard to know what Malone should be doing to strengthen his work; he doesn't really have an identity or a true north in his music, a more interesting direction to point towards. This is ultimately his biggest problem:  Complete reinvention can be a fine and sometimes even necessary thing, but if you’re going to be someone else, at least be creative about it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21928-august-26th/,Self-released,2016.0
104,Chance the Rapper,Coloring Book,Rap,9.1,May 17 2016,kris ex,Contributor,"When Chicagoan Chance the Rapper delivered his verse on ""Ultralight Beam,"" the opening song from Kanye West's The Life of Pablo, there was a lot going on—sly homage was being paid to West; rappers were being put on notice (""This is my part/Nobody else speak""); and, most importantly, Chance was encapsulating his past, asserting his present, and telegraphing his future. He was finally positioning himself as a rapper to be reckoned with from a mainstream podium, but he was also delving deep into Christian ideology, with allusions to Noah's Ark and Lot's wife, with his ""foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea."" That verse rolled out the red carpet for Kanye's long-awaited album, but it doubled as an announcement of Chance's new Coloring Book (then given the working title Chance 3), which may very well be the most eagerly-anticipated hip-hop project this year that doesn't come attached to an actual record label. West billed his album as ""a gospel album with a whole lot of cursing on it,"" but The Life of Pablo wasn't that; it was a rap album with some gospel overtures. Coloring Book, however, fits the billing, packing in so much gospel verve that it sounds like Hezekiah Walker & the Love Fellowship Crusade Choir are going to drop into half the tracks and recite 1 Timothy 4:12 in chorale. Instead, we get Kirk Franklin promising to lead us into the Promised Land, alongside appearances by demonstrated materialistic heathens like 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne, Young Thug, and Future—and the result is an uplifting mix that even an atheist can catch the Spirit to. Thematically, *Coloring Book *is a far cry from Chance's previous efforts. His debut mixtape, 10 Day, was a small, heavy-lidded odyssey of being suspended from high school ""for chiefin' a hundred blunts;"" his breakthrough, 2013's dilated Acid Rap**, contained songs about being a ""Chain Smoker"" and confessions of ""cigarettes on cigarettes/My momma think I stank/I got burn-holes in my hoodies."" But here, on Coloring Book, Chancelor Bennett observes that ""we don't do the same drugs no more"" over acoustic piano and choristers backing his sentiments. He says the song is not about drugs, but it still comes off as a sobering admission from a rapper who once dedicated a small travelogue to taking acid south of the U.S. border. ""Music is all we got,"" Chance professes on ""All We Got,"" the inaugural number featuring the Chicago Children's Choir and West returning the ""Ultralight Beam"" favor—but it's clear from the outset that this is Chance's show. His vocals—elastic and taut, all jerky grace, full of word-sound collages that hearken back to his spoken-word genealogy— are now almost fully dedicated to God and being high on life. ""I get my Word from the sermon/I do not talk to the serpent/That's a holistic discernment,"" he raps before threatening to ""give Satan a swirly."" Although his puerility remains intact, his fervor is amplified as never before. On ""Blessings,"" poet-activist-singer-songwriter Jamila Woods comes through with the hook: ""I'm gon' praise Him/Praise Him 'til I'm gone,"" while Chance drops sanctified tweetables: ""I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom/Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom"" and ""Jesus' black life ain't matter/I know, I talk to his daddy."" He also manages to mix in heavenly faith,  the joy of fatherhood, and redemption in a couplet and a half: ""I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions/Like my ex-girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything/I'm at war with my wrongs."" It's a heavy message delivered lightly, with tongue aflame. Coloring Book is not all about transcendence, however. Despite asking ""when did you start to forget how to fly?,"" Chance still has his feet firmly planted as one of the biggest independent rappers of the moment. On ""No Problem"" he raps, ""If one more label try to stop me/It's gon' be some dread-head n-ggas in your lobby."" (In a sublime stroke, the song features Lil Wayne, stretching and compacting his flow to approximate Chance's delivery while speaking on his own ongoing contractual issues with Cash Money Records.) ""Mixtape"" features Young Thug and Lil Yachty—two rappers who have found growing success by upending traditional music industry norms like Chance—to speak on their outsider stances. Thug doesn't get specific enough to make the song as heavy as it might have been, but Yachty's verse is strong (""Time and time again they told me no/They told me I wouldn't go…/Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper/Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater/Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer"") and helps the hook shine through: ""Am I the only one who still cares about mixtapes?"" (It's worth noting that Chance, who has never released a project for sale before, also released a real-time mixtape last year with fellow outlier Lil B.) The bars here are so hard that it ain't one gosh-darned part you can't tweet, but the tracks carry their weight like their brother's keeper. ""Summer Friends"" hisses with soft humidity;  ""Juke Jam"" is the soundtrack to a candle-lit bedroom; ""All Night"" moves its feet to Chicago house, courtesy of a roller-rink jam from Kaytranada. But the bulk of this record is handled by musical ensemble the Social Experiment. They're Chance's trusted collaborators—together they released last year's Surf, spearheaded by Donnie Trumpet*—*and they've been refining a sound of expansive but intimate live jazz-indebted soul for the past few years. Here, they take listeners to church with organs on ""How Great,"" steel drums on ""Angels,"" and choirs, choirs everywhere. On the ""Blessings"" reprise that closes out the album, there's an uncredited ""All of the Lights""-esque group harmony courtesy of Ty Dolla $ign, Raury, Anderson .PAAK, BJ the Chicago Kid, and others. Coloring Book is one of the strongest rap albums released this year, and is destined to be on year-end lists aplenty. It's a more rewarding listen than Drake's recently released VIEWS; it's nearly as adventurous as The Life of Pablo. In execution and focus, it comes as a joyful, praise-dancing rejoinder to Kendrick Lamar's *To Pimp a Butterfly**. *It feels a bit silly to compare Coloring Book to Butterfly, but it feels even sillier not to. When music comes like this—personal and panoramic, full of conversations with God, defying hip-hop norms while respecting them, proving that the genre can still dig deeper into its roots—it needs to be contextualized as what it is. This is an ultralight beam; it's a God dream. Correction: The original version of this review stated Chance was suspended from college. He was suspended from high school.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21909-coloring-book/,,2016.0
105,Miles Davis,The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection,Jazz,8.4,May 16 2016,Michael J. Agovino,Contributor,"When you talk about Miles Davis, you’re really talking about something like eight musicians: a sideman to Bird during the bebop revolution; catalyst of cool jazz; hard bop and modal pioneer; enabler of John Coltrane and leader of the “first great quintet”; nurturer of the younger “second great quintet” in the mid-'60s; collaborator in large ensembles with his musical soul mate, Gil Evans; initiator of an uncompromising jazz-rock-funk fusion; and elder statesmen of a more polished, though still-distinct, fusion in the 1980s. Even within those periods there are fascinating mini-chapters, like his work from the early 1950s. Now, on the occasion of what would’ve been Miles Davis’ 90th birthday this month, comes The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection, a sometimes-disorienting, ultimately sumptuous set of eleven vinyl records from 1951–54, nine of which feature Miles as the sole leader. The bulk of Miles Davis’ canonical output is on Columbia Records, which he left in 1986 for Warner Brothers in his final years. His pre-Columbia work from 1951–56 was, for the most part, on Prestige Records, a small, fledgling indie label in Hell’s Kitchen launched by Bob Weinstock in 1949. This set is not a comprehensive examination of his stay at Prestige—that is available on the 8-CD Miles Davis Chronicle: The Complete Prestige Recordings, 1951–1956—nor is there any new material here, but the recordings are in the exact format of their release, the forgotten 10-inch vinyl record, something new at the time that could accommodate more minutes than 78 rpm discs, which were the common format for popular recordings. “I was excited about the freedom this new technology would give me,” Miles wrote in his autobiography. “I had gotten tired of that three-minute lockstep that the 78s had put musicians in.” If you’re not familiar with the 10-inch format, you’ll have to stay on your toes, as sides rarely go beyond 12 or 13 minutes (and sometimes run for as little as 8 minutes.) The set is in chronological order, more or less, to show how his work progressed, and features the original cover art, complete with typographical errors. (A 7–by–10 replica of one of Miles Davis’ paintings is also included.) The music, too, will keep you on your toes, and enthralled. In many ways, this is one of his most rollicking periods. It’s post-Bird, post-birth-of-cool (released by Capitol Records), yet pre-great quintet with John Coltrane, which coalesced at Prestige in 1955 (not included in this set) and progressed into super-stardom at Columbia. Miles is still very much trying to find himself, musically and personally. A few of the musicians he organized for what several years later was called Birth of The Cool—white musicians, it should be said— took it to the West Coast and ran with it. Meanwhile, he was battling heroin addiction. “Heroin,” he wrote in his autobiography, “was my girlfriend.” The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection is a document then of a search, an exhilarating one: a search for self, a search for a sound, a search for an aesthetic, a search for like minds. His various band mates on these dates include: Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Jackie McLean, Charles Mingus, John Lewis, Max Roach, Lucky Thompson, Roy Haynes, Horace Silver, Milt Jackson, Thelonious Monk, and Zoot Sims, whom, according to Miles’ autobiography, he did heroin with right before they recorded Miles Davis Plays the Compositions of Al Cohn in January 1953, on LP 4. It is—maybe because of the drugs, maybe because it wasn’t Miles’ idea to play Cohn’s music—one of the rare uninspired records here. So is the first, Modern Jazz Trumpets, of which Miles is only one of four leaders, along with Fats Navarro, Dizzy Gillespie, and the forever under-appreciated Kenny Dorham, highlighted on the cover as “Kinny.” (Remember, typos preserved.) The rest—before H and after H—is nearly always stirring. Of that first recording, even Miles admitted he wasn’t up to par: “I didn’t play well,” Davis wrote of that January 1951 session, “but I think everyone else played well—especially Sonny [Rollins].” Indeed, Miles and Sonny had something special, and they have three dates together on this set across four of the LPs. As exceptional as some of the talent Miles assembled is, it didn’t always produce memorable partnerships. Charles Mingus, who plays piano on one tune—and he was a good piano player, just listen to Mingus Plays Piano—was never a going to be good fit with Miles. They both had huge personalities. And although he and Thelonious Monk did mesh well together, and played beautifully on four of these LPs, they clashed personally. By around 1954, Miles wrote that he’d hoped to form a steady touring band with Rollins, Horace Silver on piano, Kenny Clarke on drums, and Percy Heath on bass. It wasn’t meant to be: Rollins had to deal with his own drug issues; Silver joined Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers; and Clarke went to the Modern Jazz Quartet. That great-quartet-that-never-was did have one session, on the LP Miles Davis with Sonny Rollins from June 29, 1954. The results hover around perfection as they play the Rollins originals “Oleo,” “Airegin,” “Doxy,” and the Gershwin standard “But Not for Me.” Miles kicked his heroin habit by 1954 and had a great year, all of which is included in this set, and almost all of his sessions were now recorded at Rudy Van Gelder’s across the river in New Jersey (though in his Hackensack living room, before he built his fabled studio in Englewood Cliffs). The following year, he did settle on a band, but with another tenor, John Coltrane, a 20-year-old bassist named Paul Chambers, Red Garland on piano, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Not so bad. That quintet would go on to have recording dates for Prestige in 1955 and '56, which became the four albums Cookin’, Steamin’, Relaxin’, and Workin’, though now on 12-inch vinyl as the industry transitioned yet again by the mid-'50s. The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection can, however, be a little puzzling. If you have a collection of Miles Davis records and want to know if you already own some of this material, it might not be immediately clear. Many fans might own a previous version of, say, Walkin’, which on the cover says “Miles Davis All Stars.” But here, “Walkin’ ” appears not as an LP but merely as a tune—a phenomenal 13-minute version with the superlative tenorist Lucky Thompson—from the April 29, 1954 LP Miles Davis All Star Sextet. Nor is it spelled out that Walkin’ (the 12-inch version, released by Prestige in 1957) is a compilation of two of the 10-inch LPs—Miles Davis Quintet in addition to Miles Davis All Star Sextet—plus one song not on this set. It all gets a little eye-crossing. You can figure most of this out, eventually, flipping back-and-forth from the 12-inch or CD you own (if you do) and the enclosed booklet. It is either maddening or a little fun, depending on your disposition—the fan as archivist. The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection even rewards when you least expect it, like in 1951’s Lee Konitz Featuring Miles Davis, one of the few times, besides with Bird, where Miles was a sideman. (Cannonball Adderley’s 1958 Blue Note album Somethin’ Else was another, a record so luminous Uniqlo made a T-shirt out of it.) They were colleagues from Birth of the Cool, and Miles liked his playing, even defended him when he was criticized by other black musicians for hiring a white saxophonist. Konitz, the proto avant-gardist who was the first musician to record for Prestige in '49, worked hard—like Miles—to never sound like anyone else, and the two are almost otherworldly here, drifting inquisitively around each other, then as one, as if it were the birth of the free-cool. The daring hints at what would come, for Konitz (still underrated and still playing challenging music at age 88), and for Miles, always prepared to risk, always willing to move beyond his comfort zone. To hear Miles Davis develop—as a person, as a musician, and as a bandleader, in the midst of technological changes—makes this series of recordings on Prestige specialized, yes, but also quite special.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21918-the-complete-prestige-10-inch-lp-collection/,Prestige,2016.0
106,Radiohead,A Moon Shaped Pool,Rock,9.1,May 11 2016,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Radiohead, who titled their ninth studio album A Moon Shaped Pool, have a unique grasp on how easily profundity can slip into banality. Their music is obsessed with the point where great truths harden into platitudes, where pure signal meets wretched noise. In the past, Thom Yorke has sharply peppered his lyrics with everyday cliches to suggest a mind consumed by meaningless data, but on the new album, he largely moves beyond cynicism. He is now considering simpler truths in a heretofore-unexplored register: wonder and amazement. “This goes beyond me, beyond you,” he sings on “Daydreaming.” “We are just happy to serve you.” There is no concealed razor under Yorke’s tongue as he offers this thought, or in the pearly music that surrounds him. It sounds for all the world like the most cloistered and isolated soul in modern rock music opening up and admitting a helplessness far more personal than he’s ever dared. Yorke has flirted with surrender before, and on A Moon Shaped Pool, that submission feels nearly complete. The album is framed by two older pieces of music that act as gateways to the darker, unfamiliar waters within. Opener “Burn the Witch” has been floating around, in some form or another, since Kid A. “This is a low-flying panic attack,” Yorke announces, explicitly linking to the bad old days of air crashes, iron lungs, and wolves at doors. (In fact, several of the song’s lyrics—“avoid all eye contact,” “cheer at the gallows”—first appeared in the album art to 2003’s anti-Bush polemic Hail to the Thief.) Meanwhile, Jonny Greenwood’s brittle modernist string arrangement reinforces the angst, turning the orchestra into a giant pair of gnashing teeth. It’s a vintage splash of Radiohead stomach acid, a cloud of gnats unleashed in your cranial nerves. It also feels like an exorcism for what follows: a plunge into something scarier than the military industrial complex, or the insidious nature of propaganda, or human nature’s disturbing tendency towards unquestioning obedience. Yorke separated from his partner of 23 years and the mother to his two children last August, and on “Identikit,” he sings “Broken hearts make it rain” and “When I see you messin’ me around, I don’t want to know.” That isn’t to say that this is necessarily a “break-up album.” Separations (particularly those involving children) take place in the harsh light of day, with lawyers’ appointments and checklists and logistical arrangements. Radiohead albums are the stuff of dreams and nightmares, and the band retains a healthy resistance to clarity; their music is a maze of signs you can peer into any way you like. Even so, the impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way you can only be after a tragedy. “There’s a spacecraft blocking out the sky,” Yorke observes on “Decks Dark,” as choral voices pass overhead. The scene is straight from 1997’s “Subterranean Homesick Alien,” but here Yorke doesn’t sound “uptight.” He sounds utterly drained, as if impending invasion doesn’t concern him at all. A song title like “Glass Eyes” hints at many of the band’s longstanding morbid preoccupations—the semblance of humanity in something cold and dead, or the violation of the biological body by foreign objects—but the song is a bloodflow of strings straight into the heart. “Hey it’s me, I just got off the train,” Yorke sings, and it’s a strikingly ordinary image: the Paranoid Android himself, picking up the phone and calling someone to tell them he’s just arrived. “I feel this love turn cold,” he confesses as the ballad draws to a close, the phrasing an echo, subconscious or not, of his Kid A sign-off “I’ll see you in the next life.” A throbbing cello appears like a lump in the throat; the song fades away. Throughout the album, Yorke’s everyday enlightenment is backed by music of expanse and abandon. The guitars sound like pianos, the pianos sound like guitars, and the mixes breathe with pastoral calm. “The Numbers,” a song about the impending apocalypse brought on by climate change, meanders along, its groove as wide as an ocean. Even the malevolent synth wave that passes through “Ful Stop” sounds like a visitor, a momentary darkness rather than a caged spirit. As the song builds, the band works up a coursing groove that will feel familiar to longtime fans, with its interlocking guitars and an arterial bustle of rhythms serving to launch Yorke’s wordless moan. It’s a sound that Radiohead has spent the last decade honing, but the payoff here is deeper and more gratifying than it has been in a while. The added dimension comes from Yorke, who pumps fresh oxygen into these songs, many of which have existed in sketch-like forms for years. On the lonely folk hymn “Desert Island Disk,” he sings of an epiphanic experience: “The wind rushing ‘round my open heart/An open ravine/In my spirit white.” As a vision of transformation, it feels like the inverse to *Amnesiac’*s “Pyramid Song,” where his only companions were the dead; here, he is “totally alive.” And then there’s “True Love Waits.” It’s an old song, one that has been around in various forms for over two decades, but unlike “Burn the Witch” or the other teased sketches and scraps that Radiohead diehards pick apart on forums, it’s long been a part of their canon. It appeared on the 2001 live album I Might Be Wrong and, dragged into 2016, feels like a relic from a different geological era. “I’ll drown my beliefs,” Yorke sings, “just don’t leave.” It is the message they leave us with, this very open-hearted song that has always felt like an open wound in their discography, a geyser of feeling erupting out of scorched earth. Its very inclusion is a striking moment of transparency. The version here is just Yorke and a piano, so reverberant and echo-drenched that it feels like we’ve stuck our heads inside it. Yorke croons tenderly, never opening up into his chest voice. It’s sung to one person this time, not crowds. In its mundane visions of “lollipops and crisps,” the lyrics purposefully skirt doggerel, an acknowledgment that cliches can be, in fact, where all the action is. “I’m not living/I’m just killing time,” the 47-year-old admits. You can write a line like that and set it to music; you can perform it for years in front of adoring millions; you can carry the idea around in your heart and mind. But it might take a lifetime for it to strike, as it does here, with a newfound power. The truth, as always, lies in plain sight, right there in the kicking and the squealing, the panic and the vomit. Some truths just take longer to see than others.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21907-a-moon-shaped-pool/,XL,2016.0
107,Prince,Sign o’ the Times,"Pop/R&B,Rock",10.0,April 30 2016,Nelson George,Contributor,"In 1987, Prince Rogers Nelson was in transition. He’d disbanded the Revolution, the band that had backed him since Purple Rain. He’d toyed with doing a collaborative album with Revolution members Wendy & Lisa, but also abandoned that. He’d put a lot of time into crafting a record around an alter ego called Camille, whose tracks were recorded with his voice pitched to sound even more womanly than his trademark falsetto. But that too had stalled. The album he released on March 31, 1987 was a Prince solo record that, like his 1980 artistic breakthrough Dirty Mind and his two earlier albums, was essentially a one-man-band recording which relied heavily on the LinnDrum, various samplers, and his remarkable aptitude on every instrument under the sun. Of the 16 songs on Sign o’ the Times, only three have co-writers, and save for one track (“It’s Going to Be a Beautiful Night”), outside musical accompaniment is slight. In a sense, Prince’s major musical collaborator at this point was his engineer Susan Rogers, who recorded him at different studios in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and even Paris. But unlike his earlier solo efforts, Sign o’ the Times wasn’t a record by an ambitious kid trying to make impression. At 28, Prince had already made himself into a pop superstar  (and movie star too), and he easily sold out arenas. In one sense, he had nothing to prove. Yet Sign o’ the Times is the most varied, accomplished record of his prime 1980s period, a testament to the range of his gifts and the bold artistic ambition that gave his music shape. Part of Prince’s drive was that he was keenly aware that hip-hop was rising up and shifting the sound of music. Rap was entering its “golden age,” and its mix of gritty storytelling and dope beats had to be reckoned with. (Michael Jackson would release Bad, his own answer to hip-hop, six months later.) So the title cut, with Prince’s commentary on the issues of the day (“a big disease with a little name,” mentions of crack and gang violence) and minimalist Run-DMC-styled production, made clear that Prince had his ear to the street. The song functions as Prince’s version of “The Message,” and, as crazy as that sounds, it works. Prince wasn’t just wrestling with fresh energy from the streets on Sign o’ the Times, but with the twin pillars of carnality and spirituality that had defined his career and that of black popular music for decades. For this Minneapolis native, it wasn’t so much a battle between sin and salvation, as it was how the warring desires could become one, synthesized through innovative arrangements, seductive yet fraught lyrics, and that remarkable voice. “Forever in My Life,” for example, has the sincere melody of early Sly and the Family Stone. It sounds ready made for optimistic sing-a-longs. At first, you think it’s a simple love song, but there’s a devotional quality (“You are my savior/You are my life”) that makes it a chant of piety. At the same time, songs like “Hot Thing” and “It” are aggressively sexual, but in the context of the electronic, oddly-pitched sounds around the words, they seem more like the search for human connection and transcendence rather than a roll in the hay. The album’s two ballads, “Slow Love” (co-written by singer-songwriter Carol Davis) and “Adore,” are both showcases for Prince’s vocal prowess. The man was an encyclopedia of vocal styles, able to croon like a 1950s pop star on the nostalgic “Slow Love” and do ’60s soul style on “Adore.” Though equally adept at showy vocal riffs and screaming in tune, Prince’s lower, cooler register seems to express his truest self. Prince’s ability to move between genres made him a unique musical chameleon with Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney his only peers at the highest levels of pop. While he was often compared to Wonder, especially early in his career, it’s the ex-Beatle who seemed to have the most enduring influence. McCartney’s story-song sketches on The White Album helped define his career. For Prince, they were just one of many tools. His whimsical profiles of an odd elementary school classmate (“Starfish & Coffee”) and a quirky lover with the name of a celebrated New Yorker writer (“The Ballad of Dorothy Parker”) are lovely stories supported by surreal sounds and beats, suggesting you are on psychedelic journey through Prince’s memories. Sign o’ the Times is difficult to grapple with because there’s so much going on in each track. The up-tempo “Play in the Sunshine” drops in jazz fusion riffs and choral voices just when you think its winding down. “The Cross” starts as a mournful song of devotion to Christ with acoustic guitar and sitar before exploding into a huge rock anthem with military drums and fuzz guitar. “Play in the Sunshine” opens with the sound of kids at play, becomes a rockabilly song, transitions midway into a guitar showcase, and then, with a marimba, a different drum pattern, and cleverly arranged backing voices, it ends a musical world away from where it began. “Housequake” is, perhaps, the most obvious songs on the album, a funk jam that would have been a hit single if he’d allowed it to be released as such. But the care of the track’s construction belies any shallow analysis. It starts with a cartoony voice (maybe a Camille reference), a synthesized drum heavy with echo, then adds bass, keyboard stabs, and rhythm guitar. The synth drum and snare drum merge while there’s a double-beat on the kick. Live horns come it and the bass line moves as there’s both a synth bass keyboard and a live bass doing playing different lines. Various backing vocals float in and out with Prince doing his James Brown impersonation as singer/MC. Compared to the simple loops of your average club banger, “Housequake” is a symphony of syncopation. The beat moves even as it grooves. Because Prince played and recorded the album using now-vintage late ’80s technology there are moments when certain sounds, particularly the drums, are clearly of their era. But these sonic distractions don’t last as the scope of the songs, the musicianship, and overall arrangements are just too glorious to nitpick. Sign o’ the Times is a double album made with a restlessness that never allows it to settle into complacency or formula. It’s a soundtrack to a highly charged and specific period, for both Prince and his listeners. I remember partying to “Housequake” in the summer of ’87, laughing along with “Starfish & Coffee,” and playing “Adore” for my girlfriend when it was time to get busy. All these years later, it’s still a vibrant thing, the product of a great artist at the height of his powers.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21845-sign-o-the-times/,Paisley Park,1987.0
108,Prince,1999,"Pop/R&B,Rock",10.0,April 30 2016,Maura Johnston,Contributor,"For all the hot-pink light bathing 30-years-on memories of the '80s, that decade was full of dread—bad guys lurked around corners, and the threat of nuclear war hovered over the world’s geopolitik. 1999, Prince’s fifth album, opens with reassurance: “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt U,” a mushily robotic voice announces. “I only want U to have some fun.” The song that follows is the record’s title track, and with its lyrical laser focus on the world possibly ending, if not imminently then eventually, it fulfills that promise. Prince realizes the power of saying “Fuck it, let’s party” in the face of near-assured annihilation, a gesture that foments an effervescent, uncontrollable glee. (Which, here, is depicted by mashed-on keyboards and a joyously wailed policy of ejecting anyone who might be in a less-than-celebratory mood.) But we all die eventually, right? That’s the attitude that runs through much of 1999, which powers itself with machines like the Oberheim OB-SX and the Linn LM–1 while taking a slightly more sober view of the pleasures that dominated so much of Prince’s earlier work. Dangers—the bomb, “brand new laws,” sneering critics—get their airing, and time might be running out (Party over, oops!). Best, then, to get in all the good stuff while one still can, whether those feelings come from extended make-out sessions in the back of a slick car (the simmering “Little Red Corvette,” which emerges from a plume of smoke to become one of Prince’s most potent fusions of funk’s swing and rock’s swagger), late-night secrets about love and lust told among icy synthscapes (the stretched-out seduction “Automatic”), or Prince’s Holy Quadrality of Dance, Music, Sex, and Romance (the jittery “D.M.S.R.”). 1999 is a sprawling double album (“D.M.S.R.” was cut from initial CD pressings to make it fit on a single disc) on which Prince indulged his curiosity in new technology, but what’s remarkable about it is how tightly-wound it feels, even on the more far-flung jams. “Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)” is claustrophobic and tense, Prince’s pleas to a lover who’s left him behind made even more frantic by the cacophony of digital sounds ricocheting around the mix. (It’s the song that probably brings Prince’s admitted influence of Blade Runner to mind the most.) “Lady Cab Driver” unfolds like a movie playing on fast-forward in Prince’s dirty mind, with a request for a “ride” turning into a bit of slap-and-tickle play before fading back to reality—as evidenced by scritching guitars and the reprise of the song’s feather-light hook. Then there’s “Delirious,” one of Prince’s most unbridled offerings, its wheezing keyboards sounding like a mind left alone to whirl, propelled by a dizzyingly upbeat drum track and Prince’s half-sneeze vocals. The one-two punch of that track and the Erotic City staycation “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” is enough to drive even the most buttoned-up listener to their own personal brink—one that arrives even before Prince murmurs, “I’m not sayin’ this just 2 be nasty/I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth/Can U relate?” Well. When U put it like that… It’s not all fun and sex games, of course; even though “1999” makes the idea of impending apocalypse alluring, the planet still goes kablooey when all is said and done. The piano ballad “Free” presents Prince in tender mode, smearing the personal and political together as he sings “Be glad that u r free/Free 2 change your mind.” The music grows increasingly stirring, with militaristic drums and fiercely slapped bass fighting for supremacy as Prince sings of creeping clamp-downs. And “All the Critics Love U in New York” takes the self-regard exhibited by the city and its more pretentious inhabitants and mashes it into a ball. But those forays into the wider world only give the more pleasure-minded tracks on 1999 more urgency and lightness. Prince played with different toys on 1999—new synths, new sexual frontiers, new paranoias. He bent them to his will, though, and this 11-song opus was the result. Balancing synth-funk explorations that would reverberate through radio playlists’ ensuing years, taut pop construction, genre-bending, and the proto-nuclear fallout of lust, 1999 still sounds like a landmark release in 2016; Prince’s singular vision and willingness to indulge his curiosities just enough created an apocalypse-anticipating album that, perhaps paradoxically, was built to last for decades and even centuries to come.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21842-1999/,Warner Bros.,1982.0
109,Prince,Dirty Mind,"Pop/R&B,Rock",10.0,April 29 2016,Barry Walters,Contributor,"At the dawn of the 1980s, young black musicians were pretty much doomed. After disco brought forth the most racially integrated moment popular music had seen since Kennedy was shot, the ensuing backlash was fierce, and radio finally got fed up with the club scene telling it what to play. So once the airwaves declared dance music dead at the very tail end of the ’70s, African-American stars who didn’t have hits that predated disco—which was just about all of them, besides Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, and Kool & the Gang—had to either drastically change their game, face instant obsolesce, or only play to black audiences. Prince wasn’t about to take option two or three. When he signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 , he told A&R head Lenny Waronker: “Don’t make me black.” Then the multi-instrumentalist proved his hard rock bona-fides on the guitar-shredding “I’m Yours,” from his 1978 debut For You, and “Bambi,” from 1979’s Prince, just as surely as he served notice of his disco cred with that self-titled album’s “I Wanna Be Your Lover,” a major pop and chart-topping R&B hit. But still, his vibe on those early wailing solos wasn’t any hipper than that of any other geek who spent his lonely teen years mastering byzantine jazz-fusion wankery. Prince’s Dirty Mind, his first fully actualized album, changed all that in 1980—though it isn’t the thorough break from his brief past that it’s generally made out to be. It starts with the most blatant disco throb in his entire discography on the title cut, and his second-heaviest thump pounds through “Uptown,” which opens Side B. At 30 ultra-tight minutes, a length that allowed for more walloping vinyl, Prince’s sole slow-jam-deficient album is pretty much an unrelenting dance party that pointedly invited New Wavers to boogie down alongside funk bunnies and dancefloor fashionistas. It’s one of the key records that truly initiated the ’80s. It’s all there in what’s not. Whereas Prince’s ’70s albums proclaimed his virtuosity, here he achieves much more by confining himself to the simplest, boldest strokes. Like Krautrock’s motorik beat, Prince’s opening “Dirty Mind” rhythms are just about as close a human can get to a metronome; no tom-tom fills, no accents on the high-hat, just an occasional syncopation on cheaply recorded cymbals that suggest a drum machine’s hiss. Like Chic or the Cars, Prince makes the album’s inaugural guitar so staccato it’s nearly a percussion instrument, and much of the arrangement’s tension and release is located in just how much he lets its nearly solitary chord ring out. Halfway through, “Dirty Mind” breaks down in quintessential disco fashion, but right after it builds back up, four descending key changes are offset by ascending, churchy organ: a particularly Prince-like juxtaposition that offers a peek-a-boo glimpse into the convolutions—sexual and otherwise—of his psyche. The composition denies consummation in favor of suspended anticipation. Because so much of Dirty Mind’s instrumentation is expressed in prickly masculine terms, Prince’s vocals feel that much more free and startlingly girly. His generation grew up with falsetto soul men—Motown’s Smokey Robinson and Eddie Kendricks in the ’60s, Philly’s Stylistics and other harmony acts of the ’70s—and it can be argued that they scored with white audiences because their higher, more ecstatically female frequencies made their race and sexuality less threatening. But it can’t be underestimated how much Prince quite threateningly set off gaydar—particularly with this positively giddy album. Later on, he’d become a superstar singing in his regular range on most hits from 1999 and Purple Rain, but here he establishes his confrontational persona by ramping up the sighs and squeals. Although Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman—LGBT members of Prince’s peak-era band the Revolution—pretty much nailed it when they deemed Prince a “fancy lesbian,” folks of every persuasion still argue about his sexual identity to this day. That ambiguity is played to the hilt on the track that cemented Prince’s New Wave connection, “When You Were Mine.” The music evokes Elvis Costello’s bitter rigidity, but the lyric wanders way beyond that songwriter’s cuckold comfort zone: There’s the sharing of the clothes and the voyeuristic, nearly-bi way his post-breakup attention shifts from the gender-indeterminate object of his affection to his ex and her/his current steady guy. And, of course, the zinger: “I never was the kind to make a fuss/When he was there, sleeping in-between the two of us.” Whether it was sung by Prince or Cyndi Lauper, who memorably covered the song without changing its nouns on 1983’s She’s So Unusual, that line caught everyone’s attention. Only a new kind of person could do it justice. Dirty Mind’s second side is unquestionably Prince’s most propulsive suite. It begins with “Uptown,” which ranks alongside Vanity 6’s Prince-penned-and-produced “Nasty Girl” among the most daring R&B radio hits of the ’80s. But its topic is even more singular—how homophobia constricts even heterosexuals. The song celebrates a boho utopia where fag-bashing, racism, misogyny, and all other trifling shit doesn’t exist: While minding his own business, a passing hottie asks him point blank, “Are you gay?” But instead of blowing his cool, Prince reasons, “She’s just a victim of society and all its games.” To school the dame, he takes her to Uptown, a real-life Minneapolis counterculture haven back in 1980 that’s subsequently been gentrified. There, she loses her uptight ways as the track’s grinding disco-funk gains momentum; the overwhelming freedom acts as an aphrodisiac, and the once-scorned weirdo gets “the best night I ever had.” Everybody’s happy. The tempo downshifts slightly but significantly on “Head,” one of the earliest fully realized manifestations of Prince’s quintessential style. The song features another scenario perfectly archetypal of The Purple One: He meets a virgin (played with drawling deadpan glee by Coleman) on the way to her wedding, and she gives him what the song celebrates.  This results in a Bill Clinton maneuver on her gown, so she dumps her plans and marries him instead. As suggested by his thorniest, most authoritative early groove, this isn’t necessarily a wise choice; Prince vows, with not a small amount of matrimonial menace, to “love you till you’re dead.” Right before the onslaught of AIDS, “Head” was mighty strong stuff, but even it couldn’t compare to the next track: a 93-second punkabilly ditty that abruptly cuts off right as its bridge peaks, as if caught in flagrante. “Sister” celebrates incest like the rest of the record toys with sexual identity; it’s blatantly performative, yet Prince invests so much into it that it’s impossible to definitively conclude whether he fucked his sister or is merely fucking with us. The music matches this instability; his trebly guitar chords may be fast and furious like the Ramones, but the time signature keeps flipping to trip up ears and feet. The final kiss-off, “Partyup,” denounces President Carter’s 1980 reinstatement of draft registration. Prince’s fury is both straightforward (“How you gonna make me kill somebody I don’t even know?)” and efficiently metaphorical (“Because of their half-baked mistakes/We get ice cream, no cake”). Meanwhile, the track—in-the-pocket on the bottom but liberatingly loose on top—finds the pleasure in getting thoroughly pissed off, especially during its ’60s-worthy closing chant: “You’re gonna hafta fight your own damn war/ ’Cause we don’t wanna fight no more.” “Partyup” earns its “revolutionary rock‘n’roll” self-proclamation even though it, like most everything else on the album, is pretty much uncut funk with louder guitars and tunes so catchy you can’t deny the pop. Yet the attitude on this homemade landmark album, which was originally intended as a demo, couldn’t be purer punk: Dirty Mind rejects labels, restrictions, and authority. That’s why, despite its many colors, the music comes across so gloriously black; why Prince’s aura is so righteously flaming; why the singing wraps its pervy purple raincoat around what’s feminine. Prince was the kind of guy who couldn’t be boxed in by anything, so Dirty Mind has him rebelling against even his relatively ordinary and modest early success. That may have lost him a few fans. The album never went platinum in the U.S. like its predecessor or 11 of the albums that followed, and even “Uptown” narrowly missed the Hot 100. But his willful aberrance also earned him a new kind of audience, one that would also support the Clash, Grace Jones, Culture Club, Rick James, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Talking Heads, Frankie Knuckles, and all the other super freaks of ’80s rock, soul, pop, and dance music. Disco’s so-called death resurrected and radicalized Prince’s already restless definition of self.

110,Prince,Controversy,"Pop/R&B,Rock",9.0,April 29 2016,Daphne A. Brooks,Contributor,"On October 9, 1981, just five days before the release of his fourth studio album, Controversy, Prince walked onto the stage of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, faced a crowd of roughly 90,000 predominantly white people (what was then his biggest audience ever) and experienced the kind of vitriolic backlash that would become the stuff of rock legend. Invited by the Rolling Stones to open for them on their Tattoo You American tour, Prince and his band came face-to-face with the kind of hate that he would dedicate his entire career to thoroughly and soundly vanquishing. “We went on when the sun was still up, I think we hit the stage around six or seven at night,” recalled bandmate Matt Fink in Touré’s book I Will Die 4 U. “We get on stage and within two minutes of the first song the audience, which was a hardcore hippie crowd, they took one look at Prince and went what the heck is this? And they started booing, flipping us the bird. […] And they’re throwing whatever they could get their hands on…a crumpled up Coca-Cola can. I saw a fifth of Jack Daniels whiz by Prince’s face….” The scene brought back chilling memories of another turbulent, racially-charged moment in pop music culture from just two years before, when Chicago shock-jock Steve Dahl corralled tens of thousands of his listeners to pack Comiskey Park and channel their anti-queer, anti-people of color, anti-woman rage into Disco Demolition night during a White Sox evening doubleheader. The L.A. Coliseum crowd wasn’t having it and neither was Prince, who famously stormed off the stage and hopped a jet back to Minnesota, leaving his band to finish “Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad” without him. Although Mick Jagger would coax him to return two days later, the ensuing shows were more of the same, and Prince and band dropped off of the tour before his new album hit stores. Back in those days, he knew what he was up against. Prince knew that the sound and look of what he’d been crafting in the club scene back in Minnesota and further on record across three increasingly daring albums that fused slinky R&B with greasy funk rhythms, glam guitar, Afro new-wave synth, post-punk energy, and thrillingly androgynous vocals were reasons to sound the alarm that another kind of Sly riot was goin’ on. “I’m sure wearing underwear and a trench coat didn’t help matters…” he mused to Robert Hilburn in the Los Angeles Times, “but if you throw trash at anybody, it’s because you weren’t trained right at home.” Released on October 14, 1981, Controversy became a conveniently radical rejoinder to that incident, one of the most famous moments in early Prince history. If the L.A. Coliseum crowd’s violent repulsion of him brought to the surface the racism, sexism (because, don’t forget, longtime keyboardist Lisa Coleman was touring with him at that point, too), and homophobia coursing through rock culture, Controversy was another one of Prince’s defiant declarations that his revolution was not deterred, that it was still fully under way and on its way in spite of racist rock culture’s resistance to it. Controversy is often thought of as the bridge between Prince’s pathbreaking Dirty Mind and the epic, new-world-making 1999. But it was released during one of the most consequential social, political, and cultural years of the U.S. 1980s for people living in the margins of America—people of color, women, queer folk, poor folk. And the fact that Prince, louder than most all of his peers, was continuing to call, on this record, for collective social and cultural revolt through and by way of his music makes it one of the most important album releases of 1981. No one was combining the carnal with collective social resistance and political critique as overtly and as imaginatively and along the axes of race, gender, and sexuality as Prince all throughout his three-decade plus career, and especially on this record. As he had on his previous releases, he assumed the role of the pan-musician on Controversy, having a hand on nearly every instrument but also calling on Coleman for backing vocals (on the album’s title track, and “Ronnie, Talk to Russia” and “Jack U Off”). Fellow future members of his band the Revolution, Dr. Fink and Bobby Z. would supply keyboards (as did Coleman) and drums, respectively on the closing track, “Jack U Off.” A seven-minute dance epic unto itself, “Controversy” is comprised of many moving parts: oft-cited anti-confessional lyrics (“Am I black or white/ Am I straight or gay…”), vocals that swing between the spoken and the sung, an oscillation between concern for the “I,” the “you,” and the “we,” the Princely melding of the high spiritual (including a recitation of The Lord’s Prayer) and the suggestion of the profane (“I wish we all were nude…”), the dream of no boundaries (“I wish there were no black and white/ I wish there were no rules…”). It’s a song about a longing to be emancipated from our most wretched and oppressive inhibitions and biases, and as Prince climbs a register and takes us to the gripping bridge (“Some people want to die/ So they can be free”), we hear the suggestion of other places where we might go with him. “Sexuality” represents the Utopia Prince has always pursued, a place that was for him often one and the same with heaven. “Let your body be free,” he implores on this throbbing manifesto, willing his listeners towards the queer future elsewhere. Prince makes liberal use of that signature vocal squeal—filthier and more sexually intimate than James Brown’s scream, filled with lust, mischief, orgasmic delight, gasps and exhalations. It is the sound of revelry in the body that gives way to a call to “stand up everybody” while he talks of “revolution” and a “new age revelation” that we “don’t need no race.” All we need is each other on the dancefloor and in the act of profoundly erotic coupling. On the surface, Prince’s insistence on sexuality as the key to liberation seems about a decade late: post-free-love era, after the official timelines for the feminist and LGBT revolutions and the golden years of funk and disco. As much as critics were swooning over the fearless edge and hybrid genre and gender-bending he’d exhibited with abandon on Dirty Mind, most people considered the content of Prince’s message out of time and place, the cries of an oddball brother from the cold Midwest. But the intensity and urgency of this music put it in the here-and-now. Protest songs had gone out of fashion in the early '80s. In the moment right before the era of Band Aid, Amnesty International, and U.S.A. for Africa, pop protest was largely absent from the airwaves, and even if it had been in fashion, no one other than Prince would have been yoking together lyrics about the body with calls to have children avoid television ""until they know how to read"" (rather than just how to “cuss, fight and breed”). What did it mean for Prince to seemingly be yelling into the wilderness about getting in formation? Who, in God’s name, was Prince addressing earlier that year when, during his ""Saturday Night Live"" debut, he closed out “Partyup” with that song’s blazing refrain, “You’re gonna have to fight your own damn war/ ‘cause we don’t want to fight no more!” before angrily leaping off the stage, storming into the audience and out of camera range? Particularly in hindsight, there was much worth fighting against in 1981, especially if you were an African-American avant-garde, countercultural pop musician. It was the year Ronald Reagan took office, thus igniting a new repressive regime of economic, social, and cultural policies that would further oppress poor and working class communities and communities of color. It was the year of what was, at the time, thought to be the earliest reported cases of the AIDS virus. It was the year that African American loner Wayne Williams was brought into custody as a suspect in the Atlanta child murder cases, and it was the year of what is sometimes referred to as the last recorded lynching of an African-American by members of the KKK. Controversy’s two opening tracks open fighting and dancing, demanding that we dance ourselves out of clothes, out of our constrictions as a way to fight the corrosive powers that be. It is the sound of a battle under way, and the doe-eyed beauty on its cover, the one in the diamond-studded purple jacket with white shirt and bolero tie, the one with the “Rude Boy” button that signaled his solidarity with black diasporic ska and punk insurgencies, the one  with his back against a wall strewn with Prince daily news headlines, is here on this record ready to play “Dr. Everything Will Be Alright” as well as apocalyptic prophet. The former persona rules over Side One, where we find him fighting the tyranny of alienation (life looked at “through a pocket camera,” as he sees it on track two) with the joy of copulation on the fight-the-power-through-funking track “Sexuality.” Having remade the universe in his own image, the first side closes in the bedroom with one of Prince’s great sex ballads (of which there are dozens). On “Do Me, Baby,” Prince transitions genres yet again, moving into full soul falsetto to stage a scene of carnal supplication, a slow jam dripping with angst and wanting and sensual desperation. It’s a come-on song that’s all about the desire to be taken, a love song delivered by an impish sprite of a man who’s prone to wearing bikini briefs and constantly on the make. “Do Me, Baby” ends not with two-person consummation but with a staged scenario (characteristic of long form R&B and funk narratives) in which our hero takes matters into his own hands to reach ecstasy while his lover sits and watches. “I’m not gonna stop,” he declares, “until the war is over.” The second half of Controversy is less cohesive as a narrative about sexual insurgency as protest and social reform, but it nonetheless repeatedly returns to these themes across four tracks that swing between hope and despair, the ecstatic and the horrific, the traumatic and the bawdy. If, on the first side, Prince asks us (almost incredulously), “Don’t you wanna play?,” on Side Two, he pushes the art of sexual play to Holy Revival heights on “Private Joy,” a song that marries soul-meets-rockabilly vocals with a Sunday morning, get happy, arrangement that spins us into the center of the church sanctuary and right out the door into the pagan after-hours club. Still full of the surprises and still unsatisfied living in one sonic register, the Prince on “Private Joy” moves into a disco bassline breakdown towards the end of the track where that other well known voice—as in the lowdown, get-underneath-your-clothes-and-talk-dirty-to-you commanding Prince voice—emerges to announce that he’s defeated all competing suitors for your love: “Strangled Valentino/Been mine ever since/If anybody asks you/you belong to Prince…” A spiraling guitar solo closes “Private Joy” and burns with annihilating fire into the most pointedly political track on the album, “Ronnie Talk to Russia.” Hell hath no fury like Prince delivering a no nukes message, even if this track’s literal bluntness lacks the lyrical poetry of Controversy’s sonic inventiveness. A hail of Hendrix “Machine Gun” guitar feedback and drum fills open the track and carry out the frenzy of Prince’s appeal for global diplomacy as a solution to the threat of mass catastrophe. It’s the shortest track on the album, more like a concise, high-voltage nightmare interlude where he chooses not to linger. Just as quickly as it’s started, the track is done, blown to bits and leaving Prince to get back to the hard labor of deep, gritty, gratifying movement on “Let’s Work,” an exquisite, mid-tempo dance track with a sinuously insistent bass line that fuels the electric slide togetherness of the party. What often catches people off guard about Controversy is its dramatic mood swings, particularly in the final few songs of the record. From the celebratory heat of “Let’s Work,” the record careens towards the dark techno-goth-rock nadir on “Annie Christian,” a parable in which Prince, with overdubs, recites (rather than sings) the dizzying tragedy and persistent anxieties that come with fame in the age of early ‘80s celebrity assassination and assassination attempts. “Annie Christian/Annie Christ,” the obsessive fan figure circa 1980/1981, prowls the streets in the wake of John Lennon’s murder and the Jodie Foster-inspired shooting of Reagan (“She tried to kill Reagan/ Everybody say gun control…”). As the speaker resolves to “live” his “life in taxicabs” until this femme fatale is “crucified,” one hears the kind of haunting paranoia (laced with just a mild bit of sexist mythology) that surfaces several decades later on Kendrick Lamar’s albums during those moments when he does battle with “Lucy” (Lucifer) for his soul. Prince, to the very end, though, is at heart an optimist and an artist who chooses to fight the demons of the world with his superhero virtuosity as a musician, as a man of deep (and sometimes shifting) faith, and as a champion of and protector of black culture as the bedrock of modern sound and salvation. He was also a humorist, a prankster, and a trickster, itself a supremely African-American expressive tradition used as a means to survival. And so Controversy, a dead serious album, ends with the sounds of high levity and inanity on “Jack U Off,” a bald-faced, high-tempo braggadocio track all awash in synths. To close this album, his highness turns to pornographic farce, fun and games in a song that at once invokes early rock’n’roll guitar and '80s pop. He gives us a blue Little Richard ditty for the Reagan era but minus the family-friendly innuendo and assures us that we’ll find pleasure together in these uncertain times.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21843-controversy/,Warner Bros.,1981.0
111,Beyoncé,Lemonade,Pop/R&B,8.5,April 26 2016,Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,"On her sixth solo album, Beyoncé Knowles Carter starts rolling mid-scene: She’s just realized that her husband is cheating on her. The surrounding context is familiar to anyone who follows popular culture. Beyoncé and Jay Z are the most famous musical couple on the planet, and Beyoncé in particular is in a great place. With 2013’s Beyoncé, MJ-level talent met pop-perfectionism in a moment that defined album-cycle disruption; moreover, it was a victory lap Bey took as pop feminism's reigning goddess. Jay Z, on the other hand, is a rapper who used to rap brilliantly and sometimes still sounds good when he really tries, but his music has become secondary. Over the course of their eight-year marriage and long courtship before that, Jay Z and Beyoncé’s private relationship seemed to play out in song, in concert, and of course, in the tabloids. But Beyoncé’s “smile pretty and give no interviews” approach to public relations over the last couple of years, combined with “the elevator incident” and subsequent speculation about the state of their marriage, and followed by their public makeup (see: VMAs 2014, On the Run Tour), has suggested that something has changed, but that Beyoncé would prefer we not know the specifics. Lemonade shatters this theory. If the album is to be considered a document of some kind of truth, emotional or otherwise, then it seems Beyoncé was saving the juicy details for her own story. Because nothing she does is an accident, let’s assume she understands that any song she puts her name on will be perceived as being about her own very public relationship. So what we think we know about her marriage after listening is the result of Beyoncé wanting us to think that. With its slate of accompanying videos, Lemonade is billed as Beyonce’s second ""visual album."" But here that voyeuristic feeling manifests while listening rather than viewing, given the high visibility of Bey and Jay. The songwriting is littered with scenes that seem positively cinematic, so it helps that you can imagine these characters living them: Beyoncé smelling another woman’s scent on Jay Z, her pacing their penthouse in the middle of the night before leaving a note and disappearing with Blue. Lemonade is a film as well, yet the album itself feels like a movie. It’s not until the record's second half that you realize Lemonade has a happy ending. At first you might think that Bey is using the album to announce her divorce from Jay’s cheating ass. Because she doesn’t scold, “Don’t you ever do that to me again”—she drags her very famous, seemingly powerful husband publicly, in the process giving the world a modern-day “Respect” in “Don’t Hurt Yourself.” On the “7/11”-style banger “Sorry,” she turns his side-chicks into memes, which will inevitably become “better call Becky with the good hair” sweatshirts that Beyoncé can sell for $60 a pop. Best revenge is your paper. If you’ve ever been cheated on by someone who thought you’d be too stupid or naive to notice, you will find the first half of Lemonade incredibly satisfying. If you have ears and love brilliant production and hooks that stick, you'll likely arrive at the same conclusion. The run from “Hold Up” to “6 Inch” contains some of Beyoncé’s strongest work—ever, period—and a bit of that has to do with her clap-back prowess. The increasingly signature cadence, patois, and all-around attitude on Lemonade speaks to her status as the hip-hop pop star—but this being Bey, she doesn’t stop there. Via the album’s highly specific samples and features by artists like Jack White and James Blake, Lemonade proves Beyoncé to also be a new kind of post-genre pop star. (Let us remember a time, not very long ago, when Bey and Jay attending a Grizzly Bear show with Solange made headlines.) Both of these attributes—a methodical rapper’s flow, an open-eared listener’s frame of reference—meet on the slowed-down stunner “Hold Up,” where Beyoncé borrows an iconic Karen O turn of phrase via Ezra Koenig, a touch of Jamaican flavor via Diplo (again), and a plucky Andy Williams sample to fight for her man while chiding him for doing this to her (!), of all people. From there, Bey’s just like, “fuck it—big mistake, huge” and gets (Tidal co-owner) Jack White to join her in dueting over a psychedelic soul jam and a Zeppelin sample as she scowls, “Watch my fat ass twist, boy, as I bounce to the next dick, boy.” As she accuses her husband of not being man enough to handle all of her multitudes, fury frays her voice. Even on an album stacked with some of Beyoncé’s best recorded vocal performances to date, “Don’t Hurt Yourself” has her belting to a whole other dimension—specifically, that of Janis Joplin and late-‘60s Tina Turner. This won’t be the last time Bey dips into the classic vinyl on Lemonade, either: see “Freedom,” which manages to both: a) speak poignantly to Civil Rights as much as personal plight, b) sound like an Adidas commercial; this means it’s the logical choice for next single, assuming Beyoncé is still releasing those. Bey’s genre-hopping doesn’t always sound quite as transcendent as “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” however. Though certainly memorable (not least because it finds her name-checking the Second Amendment), “Daddy Lessons”—where a country guitar-line meets New Orleans brass in service of her Southern roots—is the least interesting chapter sonically, though the parallels it draws between Jay Z and Beyoncé’s own cheating father still make it crucial in the context of Lemonade’s narrative. It’s hard to see how Beyoncé could have done without any of these scenes to tell the story (not even “Formation” in the end-credits), and though the specific sounds may not be as forward-thinking as those of her 2013 self-titled, there are clear reasons for every musical treatment she has made here. Lemonade is a stunning album, one that sees her exploring sounds she never has before. It also voices a rarely seen concept, that of the album-length ode to infidelity. Even stranger, it doesn’t double as an album-length ode to breaking up. Yes, after Beyoncé makes nearly half an album’s worth of glorious rage songs directed at an unfaithful partner, she gives it a little time and remembers that she was raised to value hard work and spirituality. And so, she can’t give up on her marriage, the same one she spent her last two albums (mostly) celebrating. Beyoncé even kind of sells it, surmising with a tear-inducing sincerity on relaxed-fit soul jam “All Night” that “nothing real can be threatened.” It’s an easy platitude to make, but it’s also an extremely Beyoncé way of looking at things. For a perfectionist who controls her image meticulously, Beyoncé is obsessed with the notion of realness. That’s the biggest selling point of an album like Lemonade, but there’s a quality to it that also invites skepticism: That desire to basically art-direct your own sobbing self-portrait to make sure your mascara smears in the most perfectly disheveled way. But who cares what's ""real"" when the music delivers a truth you can use.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21867-lemonade/,"Columbia,Parkwood",2016.0
112,Sturgill Simpson,A Sailor's Guide to Earth,Folk/Country,8.0,April 19 2016,Corban Goble,Contributor,"Sturgill Simpson's 2014 sophomore release, Metamodern Sounds in Country Music, dragged ""outlaw country"" into modern times with acid-tongued clarity and a world-weary sense of humor. Its perspective was so refreshing that other like-minded albums came to be: Chris Stapleton enlisted Metamodern producer Dave Cobb to craft his own revivalist release Traveller, which won the 2016 Grammy for Best Country Album. While Metamodern Sounds of Country Music is certainly a record that invited imitation, it's darker and deeper than Stapleton's award winner or even Jason Isbell's most lauded recent solo albums (also produced by Cobb), a sometimes-nihilistic opus that proclaims things like “Ain't no point of getting out of bed if you ain't livin' the dream"" and declares hallucinogens like DMT as lenses with which to see the truths of existence. The combination of the vintage music and the album's contemporary subject matter made for one of the most memorable releases of the last five years. While Simpson could have easily milked a few records out of that glum sound and guaranteed industry adulations for decades, A Sailor's Guide to Earth represents a startling change in tone and presents a wealth of rewards for every creative risk. Instead of counting turtles and finding a voice in classic country—Simpson himself smirks at the notion that he is a modern Waylon Jennings, because he doesn't listen to Waylon Jennings' music, though the connection is by no means inaccurate—Simpson is doing something far more difficult. Embarking on song cycle that draw upon sounds and songwriting styles that aren't found on his first two records at all, Simpson draws from his time in the Navy, where he was stationed in Japan, and the record is framed as a sailor's letter home to his wife and newborn son. (It's loosely based on a letter his grandfather wrote his grandmother).  It's a deeply personal album that, while establishing Simpson as the defining songwriter of his class, displays an artistic growth that defies any sort of easy label. The premise—a concept album addressed to his own son and wife—might sound corny, but the result is a beautiful and earnest record that flips the defeatist subtext of Metamodern on its head. The moods on A Sailor's Guide to Earth are brighter than on Metamodern, and the instrumentation on songs like “Keep It Between the Lines""—much of it provided by Sharon Jones' backing band, the Dap-Kings—is denser, bolder, and more rhythmic than anything Simpson has steered previously. (Simpson produced the record himself, deciding to spend his Atlantic Records budget chasing his instincts to their logical extreme). At the climax of side A, Simpson tosses in a countrypolitan Nirvana cover; one of the LP's more jarring moments occurs when Simpson sings “Sell the kids for food"" on an album addressed to his son. To watch Simpson stretch (and succeed) is thrilling. The back half of the album is less audacious, making room for more contemplative moments like the tender ballad ""Oh Sarah."" Simpson holds onto the sneaky cleverness that distinguished Metamodern—""Get high, play a little GoldenEye/ That old 64!"" Simpson shouts on ""Sea Stories,"" like he's fondly remembering an old Cadillac—while taking a completely different journey.  If Metamodern was Waylon Jennings eating tabs of acid on a Tennessee back porch, A Sailor’s Guide is something like the musical combination of Moby Dick and Elvis. A Sailor's Guide to Earth plants Simpson at the forefront of the current crop of artists living beneath the always-contentious ""alt-country""  banner. But what's most striking is how it completely redefines Simpson's own career, and sets him on his own unique path. Metamodern became the subject of trendpieces, where critics and fans alike willingly read into the drugs-and-darkness subtext that Simpson has himself been reluctant to endorse. But A Sailor's Guide to Earth is such a rearrangement of Simpson's sonic universe that any previous categorization now seems out of date. His earlier records communicate a weariness, dedicated to the journey to whatever's at the end of that long white line, even if it's sorrow. A Sailor's Guide to Earth takes a trip somewhere entirely different and life-affirming.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21758-a-sailors-guide-to-earth/,Atlantic,2016.0
113,Metallica,Ride the Lightning,Metal,10.0,April 13 2016,Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,"Without belaboring the point, some albums change the course of music so profoundly that it's hard to imagine what the world was like before their arrival. Metallica's 1983 debut Kill 'Em All more or less singlehandedly launched thrash metal and established the template for every other speed- or extremity-oriented metal band on earth that's been active since. You can split hairs about the key role played by fellow ground-floor pioneers Slayer and Exodus, and point out that Anthrax and Voivod had also already formed by the time Kill 'Em All was released. You could even argue that other bands were bound to reach the same threshold of tempo and attack because the early-'80s metal underground was collectively headed in the same direction anyway—i.e: getting faster and heavier and building on the work of Motörhead, Venom, Mercyful Fate, and others. But the fact is, several key participants in thrash metal's first wave freely admit that Kill 'Em All gave them a framework for the sound they had all been searching for. In other words, once Metallica stepped up the pace, everyone else followed suit. Listening back through modern ears, it's almost like revisiting those first three Ramones records—you know this music shaped the world you live in, but since so many artists have added extra levels of intensity since then, there's no way to re-create the sensation of how revolutionary the music was during its time. Today, the sequencing sounds a little more abrupt, and a surprising share of the riffs fall closer to traditional Maiden/Priest-level heavy than outright thrash. But of course, there are moments—the crunching chugga-chugga riffs that propel songs like ""Whiplash,"" ""Metal Militia,"" for instance—where Metallica's sense of purpose crystallized, and it's easy to see why the band became known as such a genre-defining force right out of the gate. That said, the question here is whether there's any justification for re-releasing a title that, for metalheads, is as much a ""required listening"" staple as Led Zeppelin's first album is for fans of classic rock. It's not like the original pressing of Kill 'Em All suffered from a muddy mix or anything—dated, maybe, but not anything that could be significantly improved upon via remastering. So if you already own this music, don't expect an improvement in sound quality. And if you don't own it, you may be asking yourself: do I need to pay top dollar to get the album plus several hours' worth of previously unreleased extras? For neophytes and—unfortunately, even for dedicated fans—the answer is: probably not. At first, all the extras look tempting—several complete live shows, demos and rough mixes, the ""Jump in the Fire"" and ""Whiplash"" singles (both of which come with the same two live b-sides, which was unnecessary), and an hour-plus long interview with drummer and lead mouthpiece Lars Ulrich. If the infamous band biopic Some Kind of Monster makes you cringe at the thought of spending upwards of an hour with Ulrich talking in your ear, his Q&A actually sheds a good deal of light on the early days of the band. And, though the rough mixes vary in quality, the more fully-developed songs provide a startling new perspective on the material. Classics like ""Motorbreath"" and ""Hit the Lights"" actually sound fuller, meatier, and more vital. In this more organic form, the music breathes more. Apparently, the conventional wisdom of the time dictated that this sound was too crude for public consumption. But today, bands put a lot of effort into getting this kind of loose, raw sound on purpose. Now, we finally get to see that perhaps the final Kill 'Em All mix that the public got was too constricted, which makes sense given this music demanded a new approach to production values that hadn't been invented yet. But the new mastering job doesn't serve the main mix especially well. If anything, it only exposes the clenched and unnatural quality of the reverb that's applied to pretty much every instrument. Any time a vocal or snare hit rings out (like when frontman James Hetfield screams ""PESTILENCE"" on ""The Four Horsemen""), the echo tail abruptly closes shut. If you were used to listening to this album on a shitty cassette or in a car or a noisy work environment, you probably never noticed. Here, the clunky gated reverb becomes the music's most noticeable feature. As for the live material, it would be charitable to call it ""bootleg quality."" Not to mention that multiple rounds of pretty much the same songs get old pretty quick. The one thing that fans might hone in on is the historical value of early performances of material from the band's next album, 1984's Ride the Lightning. A January '84 performance of ""Fight Fire with Fire"" even includes a few bars of the song's delicate, classical guitar/Randy Rhoads-influenced intro played for real. (Later live shows featured the de-rigueur prerecorded version.) It must've been exciting to be in the room—as the band played on gear loaned by Anthrax after a Boston robbery, Hetfield explains with good humor to the crowd—but listening back is more an act of archaeology than enjoyment. Sure, it's funny and you can practically picture the acne when Hetfield shouts ""Come on, I want you to scream louder than the fuckin' PA!"" to the crowd. But unfortunately, it's difficult to discern the rhythm-guitar interplay between Hetfield and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett. For a more useful document of the band's original two-guitar dynamic, you're better off going to the seminal demo No Life 'Til Leather, which features fellow thrash architect/future Megadeth leader Dave Mustaine. (Hammett only played leads on Metallica's first five albums.) The thuggish lyrics on Kill 'Em All updated Motörhead's roaming-pirate vibe for a younger generation of brash American kids, as reflected in lines like ""The show is through, the metal's gone / It's time to hit the road / Another town, another gig / Again we will explode"" from the headbanging anthem ""Whiplash."" Fueled by hatred for L.A. hair metal and a pop mainstream that the band never could have dreamed would embrace it eight years later, Kill 'Em All raised a middle finger in the air while sounding a trumpet of unity for metalheads everywhere with its us-against-the-world mentality. Now, of course, its youthful persecution complex seems silly and sophomoric. But in fact, that attitude seemed silly even by 1984, when Metallica released Ride the Lightning and pretty much left its youthful naivete behind for good. Yes, Hammett and late bassist Cliff Burton's fascination with comic books and Dungeons and Dragons-style fantasy rears its head on ""The Call of Ktulu,"" but on Ride the Lightning the band no longer comes across like a street gang but like a group of frightened young men using their hellacious sound as a shield against life's unsettling realities. Ride the Lightning addresses capital punishment, death, suicide, and nuclear annihilation—basically, the array of concerns that would become metal's standard lexicon. Musically, the album represents the moment where thrash intersected with prog, thus raising the bar on technicality, structure, chops, and ambition. Its combination of broadened perspective and elevated musicianship arguably mark it as the point where metal as a whole graduated from goofy adolescent expression to an artform that could speak to thinking adults and nourish listeners long after they grew out of its primary demographic age group. In short, Ride the Lightning is the moment where metal developed a worldview. After Ride the Lightning, thrash turned into an arms race of ever-increasing technical proficiency. Again, though, did an album of such iconic stature that has gone multiplatinum even warrant a deluxe repackaging? This new expanded edition out-does the Kill 'Em All reissue with more live shows (including a 1985 Castle Donington appearance), the whole album's worth of demos and rough mixes and even more audio interviews, this time featuring Burton and Hammett. Again, though, the quality of the live recordings is spotty at best. The band trainwrecks right from note one, for example, on a March '85 rendition of ""Fight Fire with Fire."" There's a fine line between warts-and-all charm and embarrassing fiasco that should stay in the vault, and this collection all too often leans more toward the latter. Even in cases where Metallica's formidable live chops come across, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. You have to think that if better-quality recordings existed from this time period, the band would have gotten its hands on them and released those instead. There's no denying the incalculable impact of either of these albums, and it certainly doesn't hurt to have an excuse to pull them off the shelf again. And sure, obsessive completist/collector types will find a lot to sink their teeth into here. But for pretty much anyone else, other than the demos and rough mixes, these sets offer quantity over quality. Not to mention that it's irritating and confusing to navigate the difference in content between the vinyl, cd, and ultra-deluxe sets. Even the fairly dedicated fans who'd enjoy tracing Metallica's development as a live act during these two key stages will likely be disappointed here and are advised to steer clear and try YouTube instead.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21755-kill-em-allride-the-lightning/,"Self-released,Self-released,Self-released,Self-released",1984.0
114,Charles Bradley,Changes,Pop/R&B,7.1,March 31 2016,Jay Balfour,Contributor,"It’s easy to root for Charles Bradley, the 67-year-old soul singer who has spent the last few years enjoying a breakout career on Daptone Records. Bradley’s underdog narrative has remained as genuinely endearing as it has perpetually marketable, and Changes, his third album, feels like his straightforward best to date, the result of an improved dynamic between the singer and his band. If he ever sounded awkwardly patched in on previous recordings, Bradley now seems to command ownership of his songs like never before. It’s an accomplished skill in the world of retro-soul, and Bradley sounds vital instead of nostalgic because of it. Changes’ lyrics are immediately and sometimes overly familiar, but Bradley’s unmistakable voice is the obvious draw throughout. For a guy who has often been affectionately pigeonholed—Bradley has earned a tagline as the “The Screaming Eagle of Soul”—the new album instead finds him at his most versatile and complete. The record opens with a soulful gospel rendition of “God Bless America” in which the singer delivers an organ-laced testimony; the same keys pop up in funkier form on follow-up “Good to Be Back at Home.” After spending much of his seventh decade as a first-time international headliner, Bradley sings about the mixture of relief and disappointment in his return trip. Like other songs on the album, the song is vaguely and upliftingly political: On “Changed For the World” Bradley tells us ""Heaven is crying, the world is shaking."" Half singing, half preaching, he warns “God is unhappy, the moon is breaking / Blood is spilling, God is coming.” Musically, Changes fits squarely into the Daptone house sound, but the session players—primarily from Menahan Street Band but also Bradley’s touring group The Extraordinaries—are more restrained here to make room for Bradley's big presence and even bigger voice. But the album is nonetheless inflected with the referential post-funk and hip-hop drum sounds of  label guitarist Thomas Brenneck and company. Near the end of “Nobody But You” a horn line quotes the unmistakable saxophone from Seals and Crofts 1972 hit “Summer Breeze,” whereas the opening piano-laced drum break on “You Think I Don’t Know (But I Know)” conjures up Freddie Scott’s  “(You) Got What I Need,” now perhaps better known to all as the sample chop Biz Markie finagled into “Just a Friend.” Much of the album is about love: searching for it, being wronged by it, basking in it. Of the spare forty-minute tracklist, “Things We Do For Love” might be the most satisfyingly retro offering, complete with a dose of doo-wop accompaniment and a nimble, romantic groove. The album’s greatest accomplishment is in its most unexpectedly personal moment though, in which Bradley wrestles an out-of-character Black Sabbath ballad about a breakup into an agonizing paean to his late mother. After spending a lifetime estranged, Bradley patched up his relationship with his mother in time to serve as her caretaker before she passed, and also early enough that she got to see his career finally take off. In her absence and in the midst of post-success family quarrels, Bradley sounds heartbreakingly alone when he wails “I’ve lost the best friend I’ve ever had.” “Changes,” and its accompanying video, show the singer at his most emotionally unhinged and dramatically vulnerable. A few years ago, Bradley’s success seemed more romantic in its improbability. “We found an authentic soul man that liked our music,” Brenneck glowed of his band’s initial collaboration with the singer in 2012. Changes somehow feels more natural, in which Bradley comes off as an obvious star, like he's belonged here the whole time. Surrounded by talented revivalists half his age, the singer remains a precious commodity: the real thing. He’s not reenacting or revisiting, he’s on his first run through. And it's still inspiring to watch him live it out at last.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21763-changes/,"Daptone,Dunham",2016.0
115,Kendrick Lamar,untitled unmastered.,Rap,8.6,March 8 2016,kris ex,Contributor,"""I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you,"" raps Kendrick Lamar on the opening cut from untitled unmastered. It's tempting to read a lot into those words; in fact, it's tempting to delve deeply into everything about his latest release. Because when the promotionally frugal, preeminent thinking-person's rapper of a generation lets forth a largely unexpected collection of demos into a click economy of hot takes and broadcasted enthusiasm, the friction of opposites is enough to spark the kind of hopes that see meaning in everything. No other rapper has taken up so much real estate in the past 12 months while releasing so little music and sharing as little about themselves as Kendrick. TPAB—a Grammy-winning ride of densely knotted rhymes, tangled ideas, and deep sounds—positioned Kendrick Lamar as a reluctant messiah figure, and its dialogues with self and manifestations of God resisted quick-and-easy unpacking. Now, he’s released a handful-and-a-half of song sketches in a project that's neither album nor mixtape (or even EP or LP), and seem to have even less a chance of radio play than TPAB did upon its arrival. But it feels like an extension of that album's world—an asterisk, perhaps, or an extended coda. There's little doubt that just about all of these songs are from TPAB sessions—""untitled 03,"" subtitled with a date of ""05.28.2013,"" had already been performed four months before Butterfly's release, during the the long goodbye of ""The Colbert Report"" with help from Terrace Martin, Thundercat, Bilal, and Sonnymoon's Anna Wise. It's classic Kendrick—a reductive-yet-sprawling fever-chill of observations on race and the music industry that mixes stereotype with history and wisdom. It's insightful and uncomfortable, if not outright offensive: Asians are linked to Eastern philosophy, Native Americans to the land, Blacks to lust, whites to greed. It's also the collection's most fully-formed song; perhaps the only one that emerges as a finished thought here. One of the most enchanting things about this project is hearing how Kendrick manipulates his own voice before the studio modulations kick in. His vocal tics and morphs have long been technologically-aided affairs, but on ""untitled 02"" he's full of elastic long tails—partially gleeful Lil Wayne, wholly sanctifying choir sinner. He's crying for his bosses—both Top Dawg and God—while lamenting urban addiction and dysfunction, and contemplating mortality. ""World is going brazy/ Where did we go wrong?/ It's a tidal wave/ It's a thunderdome,"" he sing-raps, sounding half-possessed, half-saved. For the second half of the song, he includes the firestarter verse he performed in January on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."" But the scorching iteration of that live performance is nowhere here—he's laid-back and matter-of-fact, but his threat just as heavy: ""I can put a rapper on life support/ Guarantee that's something none of you want."" At times Kendrick is joined by other voices—TDE's Jay Rock and Punch, and Wise (again) on ""untitled 05,"" which sounds like a long jazz-groove session made just to find the best parts; Cee-Lo Green shows up over the bossa nova breeziness of Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammed's ""untitled 06""—but, much like TPAB, untitled unmastered. is unmistakably about Kendrick Lamar. The song he's jokingly creating on the back end of ""untitled 07"" shows up earlier as ""untitled 04,"" and its refrain is ""head is the answer/head is the future""—which may or may not be a multiple-entendre about sex, life and spirituality. Because Kendrick is so share-averse, goofy moments like these that would be filler on other projects have the revelatory power of a posthumous recording here. It's the kind of stuff you'd find out from other artists via their social media detritus—at the end of ""untitled 02"" he asks who's doing drums, sounding like a bona fide jazz cat complimenting Max Roach's stick work—but Kendrick has a verve for taking giant steps backwards into an era where masters let the music speak for itself. It all feels like a jazz project, but not just because he's using jazz music. These numbers are packed with more information and moods than the 35-minute running time suggests. On ""untitled 01"" he dons his robes as God's servant, talking to the Supreme Being: ""[You] told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you/ [Don't] say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you, or tithe for you, or push the club to the side for you."" (If the song's subtitles are indeed dates of conception, this one—""8.19.2014.""—suggests that Kendrick was having conversations with God about the course of his album a full seven months before TPAB actually arrived.) In execution, untitled unmastered. is a complete inversion of Kanye West's recent The Life of Pablo—it's a small and quiet statement from an artist with little to prove at this moment. Its author tempts deeper reading, but his choices and the lack of entry points—no directional song titles, no grand proclamations, no promotion—leaving nothing to deal with but the music. As with TPAB, untitled unmastered. demands to be approached on its own terms, even when you don't know what those terms are. You can't say he didn't try for you, ride for you, or push the club to the side for you.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21705-untitled-unmastered/,Top Dawg Entertainment,2016.0
116,David Bowie,Bowie At The Beeb,Rock,8.0,March 2 2016,Laura Snapes,Contributor,"Sixteen years after being released on CD, Bowie at the Beeb finally gets the vinyl box set treatment, with some scanty bonus bits: a fantastic 1971 rendition of ""Oh! You Pretty Things"" where Bowie and Mick Ronson perform as a duo, from the Japanese CD, and a previously unheard version of ""The Supermen,"" from March 1970, where he's backed by the Hype. It's tempting to assume the collection of his early BBC sessions is a posthumous cash-in, except that it was announced in December, three weeks before Bowie's death, thus making it a viable part of his beautifully choreographed stage exit. While the rush to winkle out clues from Blackstar in the wake of his passing felt a bit like pointing out how a magician does his tricks, it's worth asking why he pushed us toward these formative live sessions as he knew his life was coming to its end. Simply put, perhaps it's nothing more than a show of gratitude toward an organization whose early belief in him never wavered (and whose publicly funded existence is always under threat from Britain's Conservative government). Bowie recalled failing a 1965 audition to work with the BBC, who stated, in their classic patrician tone, ""'This vocalist is devoid of personality and sings all the wrong notes.'"" And yet they gave him another shot, as Bowie pointed out: ""So in your inimitable manner and with tremendous enthusiasm you got me back on for another audition, which I passed the second time around, which gave me freewheeling access to a lifetime of singing all the wrong notes."" This four-LP collection spans Bowie's second-ever BBC session, in 1968, through to May 1972, after which he wouldn't record another until 1991. Rather than a sign of rupture, that 19-year gap is possibly an indirect result of the BBC's support: After Bowie performed ""Starman"" on the network's ""Top of the Pops"" in July 1972, his fame rose enormously, leading him to America, tax exile in Switzerland and Germany, and into periods of immense productivity (and, of course, druggy preoccupations). Manager Tony DeFries may not have seen the point in having him do more sessions. Yet in the early days, back when Bowie was still an earnest Anthony Newley wannabe whose career could never get seem to get off the ground, Auntie's arms were always there to scoop him up and give him another shot. His first chances came from John Peel, and from there he trickled down through Radio 1's primetime slots; by 1970, he was being given hour-long live appearances on the station. It's an appealingly linear type of progress, and a literal one, too; unlike Five Years and other more carefully curated Bowie box sets, Bowie at the Beeb is an anatomy of how he became a rock star. The first session here (and second, historically) was recorded for Peel in May 1968, and finds Bowie in romantic mode, though bigger ideas are taking shape: the swoony ""London Bye, Ta-Ta"" characterizes the influx of immigrant communities to London as two lovers who don't make it. ""Karma Man"" and ""Silly Boy Blue"" both deal with Buddhism, but the latter gives the very timely fixation a Bowie spin, as he empathizes with a monk who doesn't fit in with his community. By October 1969, there's been a perceptible shift in attitudes: ""Let Me Sleep Beside You"" and ""Janine"" are tougher in sound and spirit. Bowie's February 1970 session with the Tony Visconti Trio—aka the Hype—starts inauspiciously. He covers Jacques Brel's ""Amsterdam"" competently, and the acoustic ""God Knows I'm Good"" is a tedious ditty about a woman being caught shoplifting. But then comes ""The Width of a Circle,"" and Mick Ronson's first-ever performance with Bowie. Maybe the subtlety of their work together here is a sign of a tentative new relationship: Ronson's riff is much more muted and ingrained in the mix than it would be on record, but still gorgeous. Their dynamic picks up steam on ""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed,"" as Bowie's frustrations at the loss of his father preempt a brilliantly wiggy Ronson solo. As David Cavanagh's excellent book on John Peel's sessions points out, Bowie was hardly gigging even by 1971, when he had had a bona fide hit with ""Space Oddity"": ""He doesn't have a regular band, his albums don't sell, and he's prone to being in a state of artistic flux."" So the hour-long, June 1971 Radio 1 performance by David Bowie and Friends at London's Paris Theater was a huge showcase, preempting the release of Hunky Dory that December. Never mind the size of his ensemble, however; the highlight is a box-fresh, solo rendition of ""Kooks,"" played acoustically just four days after it was written to herald the birth of his son, Zowie. Bowie always called himself a ""tasteful thief,"" and the permeability of his brain becomes clear on the third LP of the set, which deals with late 1971 and early 1972. Bowie had just returned from New York, where he met Andy Warhol, Lou Reed, and Iggy Pop. In early 1972, his covers of ""Waiting for the Man"" and ""White Light/White Heat"" are a little unconvincing, but no matter; the transformative experience has brought out a new ability in Bowie to really sell his own songs live as he never had before, ramping up his infectious, virile energy. You can hear the Spiders From Mars hitting their stride, and a lizardy streetwise quality appearing in Bowie's voice. Of course, all this nascent rockstardom comes to a head in The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, which Bowie previewed live on Radio 1 a month prior to release in June '72, across two separate sessions. By this point, ""Starman"" had been DJ Johnnie Walker's single of the week, which earned it daily plays, and allowed Bowie to delve a little further back into his catalog for hidden greatest hits: ""Space Oddity,"" and ""Changes,"" where Ronson transforms the original's hammered piano riff. But in the here and now, Bowie's ravishing yowl makes an early appearance on ""Moonage Daydream,"" and you hear him start to reach outward, beyond the intimacy of radio into the visceral performer he would become. His May 22, 1972 session ends with—what else—""Rock'n'Roll Suicide,"" the last song he would play live on the BBC for 19 years. As ever, nothing was accidental. Beyond the vinyl reissue of Bowie at the Beeb, Bowie reached out to the BBC one last time before he died. His last round of Twitter follows included BBC 6Music and some of the station's flagship DJs (along with a cheeky parody account: God). The new music industry ecosystems mean that bands are no longer built up by single organizations in the same way that Bowie was by the BBC at the turn of the 1970s, which made the day of his death all the more remarkable. Like thousands of other Brits, I found out by listening to BBC 6Music DJs Shaun Keaveny and Matt Everitt announce the news at 7:08 a.m. Although they were clearly grasping for words, Keaveny landed on the perfect summation of what happens when the value of patronage is recognized and repaid: ""David Bowie's music is an absolutely central tenet of what we do here at 6Music."" Bowie at the Beeb doesn't always make for essential listening, but it represents a foundational part of British culture, and upholds the importance of public broadcasting as a mutually beneficial relationship.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21558-bowie-at-the-beeb/,"Parlophone,Parlophone",2000.0
117,Michael Jackson,Off the Wall,Pop/R&B,10.0,February 24 2016,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"In the summer of 1976, a variety show called ""The Jacksons"" debuted on CBS. The program came about during a relatively fallow period for the showbiz brood, after the Jackson 5 ignited nationwide fervor with hits like ""ABC"" and ""I’ll Be There"" but before Michael Jackson set out for solo superstardom. Their future success seemed in doubt, and the show—with its glaring lights, sparkling costumes, and rampant cheesiness—was a Vegas-style extravaganza that played to well-worn pleasures. One recurring segment called ""On the Wall"" saw Michael inviting various guest hosts to sign a fake brick facade and do a little dance before everyone eventually ended up in a frozen ta-dah! pose. Though Michael was all smiles on ""The Jacksons,"" he later claimed that he ""hated every minute"" of it. During the show’s year-long run, he was smack in the middle of gangly teenagedom, acne and all. Raised in the limelight by an infamously strict father, Michael was painfully self-conscious, worried that he might never be able to shake his child stardom. He didn’t want to merely cling to his family’s fading notoriety. He wanted to break away from it completely. Off the Wall is the sound of that liberation. And he knew exactly what he was doing. On November 6, 1979, just as the album was starting to take off, Michael wrote a note to himself on the back of a tour itinerary, a proclamation of self so ambitious it could make Kanye blush. ""MJ will be my new name, no more Michael Jackson. I want a whole new character, a whole new look, I should be a totally different person. People should never think of me as the kid who sang ‘ABC’ [and] ‘I Want You Back,’"" he jotted down. ""I should be a new incredible actor singer dancer that will shock the world. I will do no interviews. I will be magic. I will be a perfectionist, a researcher, a trainer, a masterer… I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it. Take it steps further from where the greats left off."" Those words were eerily prescient in many ways, of course, but they also highlight one of Michael’s most important dualities: He wanted to be magical—to defy expectation and reality—but he knew that such skills could not materialize from thin air. He understood that exceptionalism took hard work. Growing up in the Motown system, he would often sit in on sessions, soaking up lessons from the greats: Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations. He studied the way James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr., and Fred Astaire moved their feet onstage, in movies, and on TV. At 17, he counted hallowed masters like Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Duke Ellington among his favorite songwriters. He had released four solo albums in the early ’70s, but Off the Wall, which came out when he was 21, finally allowed him to flex all those hours of research into something that was his. It also marked a moment of idealism. Around the time of Off the Wall, Michael’s musical and physical changes felt natural—joyous extensions of the black American experience. Disco was overwhelmingly popular, breaking down color lines and radio formats while offering utopia on the dancefloor. Coming from the segregated, working-class city of Gary, Ind., Jackson's achievements and acceptance represented a rosy view of the country’s future. But 1979 was scarred by the beginning of the quasi-racist ""disco sucks"" backlash; Michael also got his first nose job that year, narrowing his nostrils. And though he would become even more successful in the '80s, those astronomical heights sometimes catered to white tastes—in both appearance and sound—in a way that could seem effortful, cynical, and sad. So part of the reason why Off the Wall remains so unabashedly fun to return to involves that lack of baggage. For 41 minutes, we can live in the eternally young Neverland Michael longed for, a universe largely without consequence or death. This lasting affection is reiterated by a new Spike Lee documentary, Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall, which is included in this CD/DVD reissue and finds Jackson family members and associates, along with more modern stars like the Weeknd’s Abel Tesfaye, ?uestlove, and Pharrell, paying tribute to Michael’s earliest incarnations. ""Off the Wall was definitely the one that made me feel like I could sing,"" says Tesfaye in the doc, which was in part produced by executors of Michael’s estate and barely mentions anything about the artist’s life after Off the Wall. The album was released toward the tail end of the disco era and it managed to encompass much of what made that style so infectious while also pushing out its edges. ""Our underlying plan was to take disco out. That was the bottom line,"" the record’s producer, Quincy Jones, once said. ""I admired disco, don’t get me wrong. I just thought it had gone far enough."" Jones, a calm, jazzy Zen master who had worked with Dizzy Gillespie, Frank Sinatra, and Count Basie, helped Michael flesh out his own songs as well as tracks written by others, putting forth a record that is at once beautifully simple and sneakily complex. Most of these songs follow the most basic disco tenet: Put all of your worries behind you and just dance. Michael took part in this type of ecstasy while filming 1978’s The Wiz in New York City, when he would spend his downtime brushing shoulders with the likes of Woody Allen, Liza Minelli, Steven Tyler, and Jane Fonda at Studio 54. By all accounts, Michael didn’t take part in the club’s notorious orgies of sex and drugs, but he observed it, standing by the DJ booth and noticing which songs drew the biggest reactions. And he would dance, getting high off of the music and movement around him. Alongside Jones, Michael made his own disco anthems, but rather than merely copying what came before, he expanded the form with dense, orchestral arrangements that mixed in sophisticated layers of strings, horns, and syncopation while never never losing their underlying funk. This is heard on iconic opener ""Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,"" the first song Michael ever wrote by himself and the first of four record-breaking Top 10 hits from the album, which has now sold 30 million copies worldwide. It's an ode to the power of romantic love, something Michael had little experience with at that point. But the track’s intricacies, as well as the singer’s effortlessly rhythmic yelps and phrasing, suggest a deeper understanding, one that goes beyond words. Another Michael-penned track, ""Working Day and Night,"" hints at the detrimental effects of his workaholic upbringing and an encroaching paranoia, though ricocheting guitar lines and exuberant horns keep the groove moving along smoothly. There are more overt experiments here, too. ""Off the Wall"" begins with 15 seconds of sinister-sounding laughter and spaced-out instrumentation—a precursor to the high-wattage oddities of ""Thriller""; co-written by Stevie Wonder and originally intended for Songs in the Key of Life, ""I Can’t Help It"" incorporates smooth jazz and twinkling synths—its influence on Pharrell’s off-kilter funk cannot be overstated. The ballad ""She’s Out of My Life"" risks stopping the album cold with its beat-less melodrama but ends up being a classic of the form, with Michael audibly moved to tears at the end of the song, his voice cracking. It’s an imperfect moment from a noted perfectionist, and Jones’ production handles the emotion with understated grace. ""A lesser producer would have milked all that drama for all it’s worth,"" says ?uestlove in the doc, laughing. ""Trust me, if Puffy was producing ‘She’s Out of My Life’ he would have had… Kleenex sponsor the tour."" The joke resonates. Off the Wall is the product of a boy who was reared by his father to be a product, whose idols were often found on his TV screen, who understood his own commodification enough to want to reject it—while also aiming to sell a gazillion albums and unite the world and become the ultimate entertainer. There are many contradictions in that quest and, in hindsight, Michael’s subsequent pitfalls almost seem inevitable. But Off the Wall was that unlikely moment of balance, when Michael Jackson’s purity and innocence still seemed holy, not stunted or distorted. When he cried on record, he was living his art, giving us a genuine performance.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21548-off-the-wall/,"Legacy,Legacy",1979.0
118,Sia,This Is Acting,Pop/R&B,6.8,January 28 2016,Cameron Cook,Contributor,"At the age of 40, Sia Furler has been through more career phases than her most of her contemporaries combined. By the time ""Chandelier,"" one of the best Top 40 pop ballads of the decade, made her a global superstar, she had already been frontwoman of Australian '90s jazz-fusion band Crisp; vocalist for crossover lounge act Zero 7; and  a modestly popular solo artist, whose 2006 song ""Breathe Me"" was featured in the finale of the HBO drama ""Six Feet Under."" That's a lot, so when ""Chandelier"" took off, there was an excitement to seeing this relative underdog succeed so wildly in a traditionally sexist and ageist industry, all without bowing to cookie-cutter concepts of what pop stars should be. This Is Acting, the follow-up to this surprise attack on the Billboard charts, can't help but feel like the big-budget sequel to 1000 *Forms of Fear'*s sleeper hit. As the much-hyped backstory makes clear, almost every song on the album was written by Sia but rejected by another artist, from Adele to Rihanna to Beyoncé. Most songwriters would perhaps choose not to draw attention to the fact that they've had an album's worth of material passed over by some of pop's biggest names, but to Sia's immense credit, This Is Acting doesn't necessarily sound like a slapdash collection of demos or B-sides. It's a complete piece of work, and one that serves as a commentary on the intersectionality of art and fame by someone who has recently acquired a new level of notoriety. But the sacrifice here is the personal flair that gave her previous album a spark of creativity and set it apart from the songs she had already been writing for other pop stars. In a few short years, Sia has gone from subverting the mainstream to being the mainstream, and in light of that transformation, you'd expect more than a play-by-play recreation of her most recent highlights. She remains a vocal powerhouse, capable of injecting vitality into even the most formulaic numbers. That aching, slip-sliding, cracked voice reinvogorates the military-drums-and-anthemic-chorus formula on lead single ""Alive,"" and even amidst the record's slow moments, the character of her voice reels you back in: ""Broken Glass"" seems like a typical, by-the-numbers ballad, until not one, but two belted key changes rescue it from blandness. The Kanye-produced ""Reaper"" falls a little flat, missing the punch that its intended artist would have provided (Rihanna, in case you were wondering), but it's balanced by the pseudo-reggae lilt of the charming and pleasant ""Cheap Thrills."" ""Sweet Design,"" however, hints at the epic-banger party record Sia could put out if she so chose. It's an explosion of the playfulness Sia became popular for (sort of a spiritual cousin of ""Buttons"" from 2008's Some People Have Real Problems); when she sings ""Word travels fast/ When you've got an ass like mine[...]/ Where the mens at?"" it's strangely hilarious, irreverent, and above all, fresh-sounding, a song that definitely fares better in her hands than anyone else's. As her star continues to rise, hopefully Sia will concentrate on just that: saving the best for herself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21481-this-is-acting/,RCA,2016.0
119,David Bowie,Young Americans,Rock,8.7,January 22 2016,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.]  In the summer of 1974, as he was traveling across America on his mammoth Diamond Dogs arena-rock tour, David Bowie got deeply into soul music. By July, he was spiking his live sets with covers of the Ohio Players' ""Here Today and Gone Tomorrow"" and Eddie Floyd's ""Knock on Wood,"" but he was even more interested in what was happening in dance clubs—particularly the new disco coming out of Philadelphia International Records. Bowie booked a mid-tour recording session at Sigma Sound, the studio where Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff were constructing the sound of Philadelphia. But he wasn't working with Gamble and Huff, or indeed any of the studio's house musicians: He had something else in mind. The soul-inspired album that came out of the Sigma Sound recordings, Young Americans, was yet another new direction for an artist who staked his career on ceaselessly finding new directions. It was also the first time he’d made an album whose chief purpose was pleasure. There’s nothing like the apocalyptic visions of Ziggy Stardust and Diamond Dogs on Young Americans; it’s as smart as anything he’d recorded before it, but also relaxed and limber-hipped enough for his hardcore fans’ less alienated big sisters and little brothers to get into. And it was the first of his records to feature Carlos Alomar, the ingenious rhythm guitarist who would become his live band’s musical director for more than a decade. Bowie had met Alomar at a session early in the year, when he'd produced the Scottish pop singer Lulu's covers of his own ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and ""Watch That Man."" He drafted Alomar in to play at the Sigma Sound sessions, and Alomar brought along a couple of singers: his wife, Robin Clark, and his best friend, the then-unknown Luther Vandross. Always quick to recognize talent, Bowie immediately got Vandross and Clark in on the recording. At those sessions, Bowie recorded enough songs for an album (reportedly meant to be called either ""The Gouster"" or, more cynically, ""Shilling the Rubes"")—although it would've been very different from the Young Americans we know today. Its most radical gesture would have been ""John, I'm Only Dancing (Again),"" a rewritten and discofied version of a snarling, homoerotic glam-rock single from three years earlier. (Bowie didn't actually release ""John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)"" until 1979; it was a minor hit in England and ended up on his Changestwobowie compilation.) ""Young Americans"" the song was a hybrid of contemporary soul (the Vandross-led backup singers were all over it), the hyper-emotive '50s singer Johnnie Ray, and—another recent obsession of Bowie's—the up-and-coming New Jersey songwriter Bruce Springsteen, whose song ""It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City"" Bowie covered at Sigma Sound. It was also very current: Bowie sang ""Do you remember President Nixon?"" in the middle of a song he'd started recording three days after Nixon's resignation. After that initial burst of productivity, the Diamond Dogs tour resumed, now so deeply influenced by Philadelphia soul that it was nicknamed the ""Philly Dogs"" tour. Bowie ditched most of his elaborate stage design, and added an opening set by the ""Mike Garson Band""—his own group, fronted by Vandross and Clark. (Their set included a terrific Vandross original, ""Funky Music,"" as well as a reworked version of Bowie's hippie mantra ""Memory of a Free Festival."") One of the new additions to Bowie's own set was a medley of the Flares' ""Foot Stompin'"" and the old jazz standard ""I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate,"" powered by a funk riff Alomar had come up with. When the group returned to the studio in November to try to get a little more uptempo oomph into the album, they unsuccessfully tried to record ""Foot Stomping."" They did, however, come up with two killer additions to Young Americans: Bowie's dreamy, spiraling slow one ""Win,"" and his lyrical rewrite of Vandross's ""Funky Music"" as the haunting ""Fascination."" Bowie had also befriended John Lennon around that time, and invited him along to play guitar on a cover of his Beatles-era song ""Across the Universe"" at a final session in January, 1975. (Also present then, for the first time on a Bowie record: drummer Dennis Davis, who would go on to be the hidden rhythmic genius of all of his records up through 1980's Scary Monsters.) ""Across the Universe"" is the album's one genuine embarrassment, Vegas-y and bathetic. But bringing Lennon in yielded an unexpected dividend: Alomar's ""Foot Stompin'"" riff, a bit of arrangement brainstorming from Lennon, and a sharp, bitter lyric from Bowie combined, very quickly, into the stunning funk track ""Fame."" (Young Americans ended up being curiously Lennon-heavy: there's even a slightly mangled line from ""A Day in the Life"" in the middle of ""Young Americans."") ""Fame"" was a knockout, the song that gave Bowie his first American #1 single, and the soul world that he so admired took it to heart. By November, 1975, it landed Bowie on ""Soul Train."" (He wasn't the first white solo performer to play the show, but he was close.) George Clinton, by his own admission, modified its groove into ""Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)."" And James Brown paid Bowie the ultimate backhanded compliment: The instrumental track of his 1976 single ""Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)"" was a note-for-note duplicate of ""Fame."" In the context of Bowie's flabbergasting '70s, Young Americans is distinctly a transitional record. It doesn't have the mad theatrical scope of Diamond Dogs or the formal audacity of Station to Station; at times, it comes off as an artist trying very hard to demonstrate how unpredictable he is. You couldn't mistake it for an actual Philly soul record, although like the LPs Bowie was devouring at the time, it often comes off as hits-plus-filler. Still, a good deal of the filler is lovely, and recording funk and disco in 1974 put him way ahead of the curve. While there had already been a handful of disco hits on the pop charts, no other established rock musician had yet tried to do anything similar, and Bowie pulled it off in a way that not only didn't seem crass but gave Luther Vandross his big break. The album was also a vehicle for Bowie to address one of his favorite topics—pop stardom—from a new angle, at a moment when it seemed likely to destroy him. (""Fame"" shares its title with a Broadway show about Marilyn Monroe's life that closed after one performance in November, 1974; thanks to Bowie's disastrous management deal at the time, its quarter-million-dollar loss effectively came out of his pocket.) When Bowie talked about lower-case fame with Tracey Emin in 2001, he was a bit more sanguine about it: ""There is nothing there to covet.... I understand that it doesn't even get you a Madonna ticket these days. So I won't be recommending it to my offspring. Having influence is more rewarding for feeding ego."" He had nothing to worry about on that score.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21488-young-americans/,RCA,1975.0
120,David Bowie,Diamond Dogs,Rock,9.0,January 22 2016,Barry Walters,Contributor,"[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.] After a 1977 performance that still ranks among the wildest, most manic musical performances to ever hit daytime TV, Iggy Pop chats with talk show host Dinah Shore, the top-charting female singer of the ‘40s, with his collaborator pal David Bowie by his side; jazz vet Rosemary Clooney flanks Shore. Their interview is mutually respectful and endearingly sincere even as the host tries to navigate Pop’s nihilistic answers. Aiming to steer the conversation in a positive direction, she asks her guest if he’s influenced anybody, and the punk pioneer—much to everyone’s delight—nonchalantly replies, ""I think I helped wipe out the '60s."" Great quote, but here’s the thing: Pop never sold enough to do that directly. Instead, it was Bowie, his most ambitious student, who revolutionized '70s music and style by uncovering the discomfort and despair of urban life that hippie idealism denied. His third consecutive UK chart-topper and U.S. Top 5 breakthrough, 1974’s *Diamond Dogs—*Bowie’s first record of original material since killing off the Ziggy Stardust character that made him an instant superstar back home—remains rooted in his still-reigning glam scene that knocked most utopian '60s rockers off the UK charts with glistening shards of pansexuality, sci-fi fantasy, and bespangled spectacle. His bleakest album until recent swansong Blackstar, Diamond Dogs is a bummer, a bad trip, ""No Fun""—a sustained work of decadence and dread that transforms corrosion into celebration. Whereas Ziggy features its titular messiah, Diamond Dogs has jackals that live on corpses the way Bowie fed off rotting urban culture and reckless rock'n'roll. The last glam gasp of Bowie's English years, Dogs also sprawls toward Bowie’s forthcoming Thin White Duke persona, embracing Blaxploitation funk and soul, rock opera, European art song, and Broadway. The album cracked FM radio with ""Rebel Rebel,"" an Iggy Pop-like blast aimed at America’s teenage wasteland. Recapitulating his earlier achievements while raising their stakes, it stomped on whatever good vibes remained in British rock, and cleared the stage for punk and goth. As Bowie noted decades later, the tribal ""peoploids"" that rummage through the album’s fantastically bleak Hunger City like the orphaned pickpockets of Oliver Twist presaged a generation of Johnny Rottens and Sid Viciouses. Dogs envisioned a no-future future just before the next breed of pop stars lived it. As befitting a post-apocalyptic work, Dogs was born from the frustration of failed opportunities. Bowie initially endeavored to create a TV musical adaptation of George Orwell’s totalitarian milestone 1984—until the social critic’s widow refused permission. Around the same time, Rolling Stone’s London bureau arranged for Bowie and William S. Burroughs to interview each other, which introduced the singer to the author’s Nova Express. Immediately thereafter, Bowie began penning lyrical non sequiturs via that novel’s cut-up technique, and planned a Ziggy musical to be similarly shuffled each night. This, too, faltered, although it inspired new tunes. These two projects, sharing dystopian themes, fused together to form the mutant Dogs. While all this was happening, Bowie shed the Spiders from Mars, who enabled his transformation from folky space oddity to eclectic, hard-rocking freak. The biggest break was with guitarist Mick Ronson, whose biting, formally schooled style and arrangements had redefined Bowie. Rather than replacing his sidekick, the singer handles most guitar parts himself, as well as contributing sax and electronic keyboards while solely producing this emphatically solo project. Tony Visconti—who oversaw 1970’s metallic The Man Who Sold the World while providing bass guitar—returns only to assist the final mix and fulfill the singer’s request for ""Barry White strings"" on ""1984""; he’d later co-produce much of Bowie’s output. If you measure his albums by how much he calls the shots and actually plays, Diamond Dogs is the Bowie-est one of all. He sets the scene with ""Future Legend,"" a spoken-word intro soundtracked by synths evoking dripping Dalí clocks, buzzing bee guitars quoting ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,"" and other experimental studio scuzz. This slides into the bonking backward cowbell of the title track, which filters the Stones’ slam-bam boogie through a woozy mix. ""As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent/ You asked for the latest party,"" it begins—a line Bowie later admitted as self-descriptive. Set in forthcoming years yet capturing the squalor of then-contemporary London, New York, and the Eastern Bloc nations through which Bowie recently passed, the lurid lyrics flash with gang violence: ""The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees/ Hunt you to the ground they will/ Mannequins with kill appeal."" The vibe is celebratory despite the menace, if unstable—right down to the track’s note-bending central riff. Contemporary critics mourned Ronson’s absence, but Bowie’s guitar here and throughout the album is thrillingly off-kilter with unconventional chord fragments that the Edge, Sonic Youth, shoegazers, and dream-poppers alike would draw from for decades to come. Because Bowie so convincingly portrayed decay, it went often unacknowledged how far he advanced his compositional and arrangement skills in just a few post-""Space Oddity"" years. Their showcase, ""Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)"" begins with Bowie growling at the bottom of his register, but even before the chorus hits, he’s wailing near the top of his tenor while Mike Garson’s tinkling jazz keys supply the sophistication Bowie’s squawking guitars deny. Topically shifting from a hustler turning tricks to a politician spewing empty promises to cocaine’s brain-freezing bliss, the suite’s interconnected segments assert that all three demand submission to all-conquering power—this concept album’s central theme. The tempo accelerates as his poetry gains density, then subsides again as the melody soars before surrendering to guitars that grind with metronomic precision until sputtering out on the root note of the opening chord on the album’s masterstroke. As melodically constricted as that suite was expansive, ""Rebel Rebel"" is Bowie’s answer to all those deliciously dumb Sweet, Slade, Mud, Gary Glitter, Suzi Quatro, and T. Rex hits he indirectly enabled during glam’s peak. Androgyny is subtext to these acts, but the main man, per usual, pushes it to the forefront: ""You’ve got yer mother in a whirl/ She’s not sure if you’re a boy or a girl,"" goes the opening line, but he never definitively assigns gender: Bowie’s dissident has torn [their] dress, but wants to ""be there when they count up the dudes."" Yet there’s nothing ambiguous about that glorious guitar groove, the track’s stomping beat, the ""hot tramp"" pause between both, and their return. If Bowie often drifted above listeners’ heads, here he shoots straight at their solar plexus and scores with what ranks among the greatest, most insistent riffs of the '70s. Rockers who’d dismissed Bowie as a dandy now gave the dude a pass. Aside from a stray super-Bowie line about lizards crying in the heat, side 2's opening track, ""Rock ‘N Roll With Me,"" is even more forthright—a ballad of appreciation for his fans that provides reprieve from the sleaze and offers further proof that Bowie could belt. It’s stagey to be sure, but so is it sincere. ""I’ve found the door that lets me out,"" he positively roars; performance sets him free. The album is queasy soul music signifying soullessness; on the Shaft-like tableau ""1984,"" he rewrites Orwell’s authoritarian state as a worldwide ghetto populated by junkies overseen by surgeon thugs who manipulate thoughts and misguide identities, all set to wah-wah guitars. The album culminates perversely, joyfully, as ""Big Brother"" segues into ""Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family,"" a fuzzed-out danse macabre where irregular time signatures alternate every few measures and the percussion keeps changing accents; there’s no center, just brief, blissful release before a stuttering loop of Bowie yelping in distress fades as if to black. All this hopelessness and annihilation would be suffocating if it weren’t for Bowie’s exuberance. He throws himself into Orwell’s draconian hell as if strutting around in Kansai Yamamoto’s Aladdin Sane-era bodysuit; it fits his skeletal contours. Determined to reaffirm his relevance in spite of his setbacks, the singer sparkled so brightly that he offset the darkness of his material. Just as Watergate was coming to a boil, singer-songwriters and prog-rockers were glutting the charts, and '60s resistance was morphing into '70s complacency, this sweet rebel (rebel) made revolution strangely sexy again. Glaring at you from Dogs’ cover with canine hindquarters and emaciated features like the circus sideshow Freaks he footnotes in the title cut, he served notice that rock’s outsiders remained more compelling than the softies who increasingly occupied its center, even as his ever-growing popularity chipped away at it. You can bet Patti Smith, the Ramones, and Television sat up and took notes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21477-diamond-dogs/,RCA,1974.0
121,David Bowie,Low,Rock,10.0,January 22 2016,Laura Snapes,Contributor,"[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.] Compared to its predecessors, David Bowie's 11th studio album is noticeably reserved. ""I had no statement to make on Low,"" said Bowie, who could hardly write lyrics at all in the aftermath of his L.A. excesses, let alone fashion another extensive character study like Ziggy or the Thin White Duke. His lyrical gifts were already spread thin, and thinner still when a completed third verse was cut from ""Always Crashing in the Same Car,"" in which Bowie did his very best Bob Dylan impression. Producer Tony Visconti thought it was so creepy, and potentially inappropriate given Dylan's motorcycle accident a decade earlier, that they scrapped it. Bowie was hardly lucid in 1976, but you bet he knew exactly what he was doing with that verse. The mysterious injuries from Dylan's 1966 accident gave him the excuse to disappear from the rat race for years, whereas the full complement of wounds Bowie sustained in L.A. were proudly displayed for a while: the Station to Station-era diet of cocaine, red peppers, and milk, and the ensuing physical and psychic degradation that led him to endorse fascism, fear the occult, and allegedly keep his urine in the fridge lest anyone steal it. (From a flushed toilet?) When he realized he had to leave Hollywood and kick his prodigious habit, West Berlin appealed for its anonymity, though unlike Dylan, Bowie would make his own recovery a matter of public record. Both artists were escaping paradigmatic American success by retreating into themselves. Where Dylan let rumors of death fester, Bowie opened his hermitage to the world, reinforcing his outsider myth. The Bowie of this era is a tragic figure: strung out and prone to spending days awake watching the same films on a loop. He was broke from the aftermath of a bad managerial deal and drained by the related ongoing court case, and so paranoid that, after his destitute charge Iggy Pop pushed him in the pool at the residential Château d'Hérouville studio in France, he had it exorcized to avoid being touched by the ""dark stains"" that he believed lurked at the bottom. Yet Bowie's sense of purpose was at least somewhat intact. He applied exacting pressure on Iggy to make The Idiot as good as he knew it could be, and brought similar determination to Low, albeit the kind where having very few aims was its own liberating objective. Whatever they made didn't even have to be released, he told his new collaborator Brian Eno, who was brought in alongside Station to Station's crack band to further develop that album's hybrid of electronic R&B. Low's first side is a beautiful futurist ruin, littered with holes left purposefully unfixed. Two decades after its release, Bowie noted that his crew ""really captured, unlike anything else in that time, a sense of yearning for a future that we all knew would never come to pass."" Visconti heightens the decay and distills the lifespan of every sound, treating Dennis Davis' drums so that he was playing along to a withered echo of his last strike, like an explosion contained in a tin can. Even Bowie's voice sounds aged and distant. Eno's sharp electronics jostle against the bolshy funk rhythms and Carlos Alomar and Ricky Gardiner's guitars, giving the record a feverish euphoria that hits like too much pseudo-ephedrine and mangles linear time. These swaggering fragments, seldom breaking the three-minute mark, promise bombastic payoffs but then fade out instead. Low's first side feels like having the carpet ripped out from under you by three wizards who have plans to fly it elsewhere. All this playfulness means that Low's reputation for utter desolation doesn't feel quite right. Bowie is, of course, obsessed with barriers to connection: the sudden instinct that causes him to yelp and back away from someone on ""Breaking Glass"" (""You're such a wonderful person/ But you got problems/ Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'll never touch ya""), self-imposed isolation (""Sound and Vision"") and isolation from the self (""What are you gonna be/ To the real me,"" on ""What in the World""), and a semi-serious plea for lifelong companionship just as his marriage was disintegrating (""Be My Wife""). From the windows of Hansa Tonstudio (where the record was mostly finished, not tracked) the band could see into the watchtowers atop Berlin's dividing Wall. A lot of Low's lyrics were extemporized, but the consistency of these ornery admissions, however fragmented, implies a self-aware desire to push past them, to hunt some trace of optimism. At the end of side 1 comes the instrumental ""A New Career in a New Town,"" which plots the distance from Bowie's Anglocentric career to his new Teutonic mode, bridging the former's refractory squelched riff and the latter's dreamy gauze with a searching harmonica phrase: a regular substitute for emotion that the human voice can't reach, but a brilliantly strange idea in this context (as well as another Dylan affectation). Here, it's bittersweet, nostalgic but propelled by forward motion, and a resolution to commit to a place and escape his blue room funk. The mostly instrumental second side is a tribute to the people of the Soviet Bloc —Poland on ""Warszawa,"" and East Berlin on the remaining three songs—in which the elusive nature of side 1 subsides and Bowie's persona is subsumed into his and Eno's pulsating sequences. These were carefully calibrated attempts at killing the author: Eno set out a metronome pulse, and the pair selected a random beat on which to introduce a new musical complement to the central motif. On ""Warszawa"" that’s an eerily simple piano tune that was inspired by overhearing Visconti’s infant son playing to himself; ""Art Decade,"" mostly Eno’s invention, circles around a ghostly melody worthy of ""The Twilight Zone."" Bowie shrouds the tune to ""Scarborough Fair"" inside ""Weeping Wall,"" and a lonely saxophone (played by Bowie himself) eventually joins the cathedral of male vocals and strings on ""Subterraneans."" It’s credit to their influence that these songs sound pedestrian, even a little ponderous by today’s standards, but the way they conjure lost worlds is still something to behold, like the depths of dank paintings being X-rayed before your eyes. The perpetual stranger finally finds comfort in a strange land, synthesizing his dislocation (and his love of the expressionist Brücke artists) and that of these broken nations with a tense, beautiful, elemental music that speaks of genuine engagement, and an empathy that seemed impossible on side 1. It makes good on the album cover's subtle joke: a still from Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth where Bowie’s orange hair fades into the background; the word 'Low' atop a vanishing profile. Bowie's meticulously crafted existence had always offered fans a sense of possibility. By submitting his ego to Low, he was able to create a new one for himself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21478-low/,RCA,1977.0
122,David Bowie,Lodger,Rock,8.5,January 22 2016,Mike Powell,Contributor,"[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.] The thing to know about David Bowie's 1979 album Lodger is that there really isn't anything special to know: No creation myth, no alter ego, no 10-minute-long song-suites or spooky instrumentals or pretentious backstories about George Orwell and ""the squashed remains of ethnic music as it survives in the age of Muzak rock."" Actually, Lodger might be the first David Bowie album marketed as nothing more than an album of recorded music by David Bowie. ""I would like to do something rivetingly new and, uh, earth shattering,"" he said in a radio interview a few days before the album's release. ""Every Saturday I want to do that!"" Then, self-mockery: ""Let's do something earth shattering. No, let's put the telly on*.*"" A few minutes later, his digression on the metaphorical impacts of science fiction on personal identity is interrupted by a dog. Like, a canine, whimpering aloud while Bowie unburdens himself about inner space. ""I know it's a bore, darling,"" he says to the dog, and everyone, including David Bowie, laughs. The dog had a point: Seriousness really can be boring after awhile, which might've occurred to Bowie after the cold white peaks of 1977's Low. Sensing that high art might be losing its flavor, he went on a long, generous tour called Isolar II during which he revived the entirety of 1972's Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, a gesture that in the context of his restlessly radical early-'70s career would've been like staging a Vegas revue. ""He's remembering that bone shot in 2001,"" Bowie says of the dog during the radio interview. ""What a waste of a bone!"" A showman by birth and narcissist by trade, Bowie could've easily been talking about himself. Lodger has 10 songs, all of which are three to four minutes long. One is a great Talking Heads impression called ""D.J."" and another is basically a Brian Eno song with vocals by David Bowie instead of Brian Eno (""Red Sails""). The music is punky and dramatic and a little odd, with detours into reggae and near-Eastern tonalities (""Yassassin"") and nebulously exotic ""world"" sounds (""African Night Flight""), all filtered through the ears of a British guy with plenty of money and the imperial leeway to appropriate whatever he felt like. To this day, no musician has better mastered the hermetic intensity of cocaine, a drug that makes you want to have long conversations with everyone you've ever met without leaving your room. Prior to Lodger, Bowie's alien status was existential, metaphorical, general—a one-size-fits-all garment for anyone convinced they'd been born in the wrong time or with the wrong body. But for as many people who saw their idealized selves in Ziggy Stardust or Aladdin Sane, Lodger was the first time Bowie really seemed accessible—a character with flaws and frailties, petty thoughts and grocery lists; someone who doesn't just dabble in reality but lives in it. ""Look Back in Anger"" opens with a wild panorama of guitar before devolving into a story about an angel with a cough; ""D.J."" is childish and bitchy; ""Boys Keep Swinging,"" which Bowie apparently wrote after listening to the Village People, actually does sound a little like the Village People but less secure in its sexuality. When David Bowie sings the word ""depression"" on ""Fantastic Voyage,"" it's like listening to Zeus complain about sorting lights and darks. The title alone reduces his myth to something banal and transactional: No longer the Lonely Starchild gracing us with his unusual point of view, we instead meet Safari Bowie, half-drunk tourist working out his masculinity issues by haggling with street vendors, Bowie the houseguest who can't stop talking about getting ""authentic"" tacos. The first half of Lodger especially, with its cartoon jungles and mysterious Bedouins and Englishmen too dumb to stay out of trouble but too powerful to ever really be in it, belongs more to the colonial satire of Evelyn Waugh than late-'70s art rock. (Bowie said that ""African Night Flight"" in particular was inspired by a trip to Kenya where he met a bunch of old German pilots who seemed to spend most of their time getting drunk and the rest doing profitable crime in the bush.) Lodgers aren't heavenly beings; they're people with enough money to rent a room. All this didn't just humanize Bowie, it made him whole. By the time he'd released Lodger, he was 32, halfway divorced and trying to keep his drug thing in check, rich and famous and still staring down the long rest of his life. ""Radical genius"" would be nice, but so would making it to 1985 and having people still remember your name. In that sense, Lodger is an anxious, humble album, the sound of an artist ceding the wheel to a younger generation he'd be a fool to pretend he was part of. To let the culture take him out and chauffer him for a little while. Of course, he still had plenty to offer and spent the next 30 years offering it: The music videos, the generous celebrity, room-unifying songs like ""Modern Love"" and movies like Labyrinth, which introduced hundreds of thousands of '80s babies to Bowie the mischievous goblin king, prancing around in his tights. Stars might look pretty while they fall but all they leave when they hit earth is a big empty hole. Lodger is the moment when Bowie took a deep breath and started to fill it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21476-lodger/,RCA,1979.0
123,David Bowie,"""Heroes""",Rock,10.0,January 22 2016,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.] Even before David Bowie stepped foot in Berlin's grandiose Meistersaal concert hall, the room had soaked up its fair share of history. Since its opening in 1912, the wood-lined space had played host to chamber music recitals, Expressionist art galleries, and Nazi banquets, becoming a symbol of the German capital's artistic—and political—alliances across the 20th century. The hall's checkered past, as well as its wide-open acoustics, certainly offered a rich backdrop for the recording of ""Heroes"" in the summer of 1977. But by then, the Meistersaal was part of Hansa Studios, a facility that felt more like a relic than a destination. Thirty years after much of Berlin was bombed to rubble during World War II, the pillars that marked the studio's exterior were still ripped by bulletholes, its highest windows filled with bricks. Whereas it was once the epitome of the city's cultural vanguard, in '77, the locale was perhaps best known for its proximity to the Berlin Wall—the imposing, barbed-wire-laced structure that turned West Berlin into an island of capitalism amidst East Germany's communist regime during the Cold War. The Wall was erected to stop East Berliners from fleeing into the city's relatively prosperous other half and by the late '70s had been built up to include a no-man's land watched by armed guards in turrets who were ordered to shoot. This area was called the ""death strip,"" for good reason—at least 100 would-be border crossers were killed during the Wall's stand, including an 18-year-old man who was shot dead amid a barrage of 91 bullets just months before Bowie began his work on ""Heroes"". All of which is to say: West Berlin was a dangerous and spooky place to make an album in 1977. And that's exactly what Bowie wanted. After falling into hedonistic rock'n'roll clichés in mid-'70s Los Angeles—a place he later called ""the most vile piss-pot in the world""—he set his sights on Berlin as a spartan antidote. And though ""Heroes"" is the second part of his Berlin Trilogy, it's actually the only one of the three that he fully recorded in the city. ""Every afternoon I'd sit down at that desk and see three Russian Red Guards looking at us with binoculars, with their Sten guns over their shoulders,"" the album's producer, Tony Visconti, once recalled. ""Everything said we shouldn't be making a record here."" All of the manic paranoia and jarring juxtapositions surrounding Hansa bled into the music, which often sounds as if Bowie is conducting chaos, smashing objects together to discover scarily beautiful new shapes. Those contrasts begin with the album's personnel. For ""Heroes"", the then-30-year-old enlisted many of the same players that showed up on its predecessor, Low, once again balancing out the effortless groove-based rock stylings of drummer Dennis Davis, bassist George Murray, and guitarist Carlos Alomar, with Bowie's own idiosyncratic work across various instruments along with the heady synth wizardry of Brian Eno, who took on an expanded role. Part Little Richard boogie, part krautrock shuffle, the unlikely stylistic combination hints at man's evolution with technology while throwing off sparks of sweat. Also like Low, the album is broken into two contrasting sides, with the vocal tracks on the front and the back made up of mostly moody instrumentals. But setting ""Heroes"" apart was the crucial addition of King Crimson guitar god Robert Fripp, who sprayed his signature metallic tone all over many of the album's most memorable moments. According to legend, Fripp recorded all of his parts in one six-hour burst of wiry bliss and feedback, often just soloing over tracks he was hearing for the first time. That spontaneity—most of the album's jam-based backing rhythm tracks were also recorded quickly, over just two days—is part of what makes ""Heroes"" live and breathe to this day. It's an album that is constantly morphing, never static. As Fripp's guitar is shooting electrical shocks, Bowie is bleating saxophone blasts, and Eno is summoning sonic storm clouds that pass as soon as they arrive. And then there are the vocals. ""Heroes"" contains some of Bowie's greatest vocal performances, fearless takes in which he pushes his voice to wrenching emotional states that often teeter on the edge of sanity. There's tension here, too, because while Bowie is clearly putting all of himself into the microphone like never before, he would often have no idea what he was actually going to sing until actually stepping up to record, a technique borrowed from his frequent collaborator at the time, Iggy Pop. What came out was a Burroughsian stream of consciousness that suggests elements of Bowie's personal travails—involving alcoholism, a crumbling marriage, and business woes—while also sounding abstract and shadowy. He deals with previous alter egos on ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which could be read as a kind of apology for the ill-advised, coke-fueled fantasies of fascism he was peddling just a couple of years before. He muddles sleep and death, dreams and waking life. On the iconic title track, he undercuts the song's would-be heroism by placing its title in quotes; rather than bending over backwards to elevate his own myth, ""Heroes"" puts everyday courage on a pedestal. It's an immortal track all about fleeting wonders. The album's contradictory nature went beyond Berlin and its spitballing creation, too. ""Heroes"" was released on October 14, 1977, just two weeks before the Sex Pistols' Never Mind the Bollocks and a few months after the Clash's self-titled debut LP. So as punk was whirling into a frenzy, Bowie's TV appearances around the time of ""Heroes"" doubled as acts of stoic defiance. On the Dutch program ""TopPop,"" for example, he looked nonchalant in a smart blazer, button-up shirt, and leg warmers, effortlessly crooning the title track like Sinatra in his prime. During the song's swirling bridge, he steps away from the microphone, lights up a cigarette, and stares into the middle distance—the face of calm in an era of turmoil. He repeated this trick on Italian television, turning the doomsaying instrumental ""Sense of Doubt"" into an ominous art film in which he oversees a duel between a piano and a synthesizer. To this day, the video feels dangerous, unsettling. A marketing slogan for ""Heroes"" boasted, ""There's Old Wave, there's New Wave and there's David Bowie,"" which still rings true, especially in light of such performances. With the kids coming up from behind, Bowie used his experience to carve out a different kind of future. The Berlin Trilogy, and ""Heroes"" in particular, show all the signs of an artist growing up, shaking off the trappings of capitalist ego and success, and searching for a soul instead. Of course, Bowie's ego was a magnificent thing at its height, but he also understood its insatiability—how it would kill him if he did not kill it. And even in his dressed-down ""Heroes"" garb—bomber jacket, tousled short hair, jeans—he couldn't escape his own magnetism; in fact, seeing how cool Bowie looked without all the makeup and costumes could make him seem even more untouchable. At 30, he was content with his art, happy to explore humankind's existential struggles while living in a divided, war-torn city. Berlin gave him perspective and compassion. It allowed him to be small. To let his guard down and his mind wander. To begin to come to terms with his own mortality. ""We'll do anything in our power to stay alive. There's a feeling that the average lifespan should be longer than it is. I disagree,"" Bowie told Melody Maker in October '77. ""I mean, we've never lived so long. Not so very long ago no one lived passed the age of 40. And we're still not happy with 70. What are we after exactly? There's just too much ego involved. And who wants to drag their old decaying frame around until they are 90, just to assert their ego? I don't, certainly.""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21487-heroes/,RCA,1977.0
124,Little Simz,AGE 101: DROP X,Rap,7.4,January 21 2016,Britt Julious,Contributor,"Few young rappers are as explicitly vulnerable as Little Simz. Born Simbi Ajikawo, Simz shines brightest when leaning into her deepest emotions, and on her previous EPs, mixtapes, and debut album A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons, she connected harder the deeper she dug. On ""Gratitude,"" her single from her debut, she raps, ""Put my feet in the studio and call it my home while others have got no way out,"" and the listener understands the severity of the stakes. Music is her escape and it is because of music that she is later able to dive deeper into her psyche and those of the people she uses as characters in her songs. ""I ain’t never had a chance to do what I love,"" she says later in the song. ""Ain’t nobody been encouraging me. I just stay indoors dreaming."" On her latest mixtape, AGE 101: DROP X, she peels back even more layers, discussing the scheming of her family and friends in an uncompromising world and the mounting pressures she experiences as her career continues upward. ""Why don’t they like seeing women in charge? Shit I’ve seen left me mentally scarred"" she raps on ""Savage."" Despite this, DROP X feels warmer and lighter than any of Little Simz' other records, and more confident. The production is sharper than anything she’s previously done, aligning with a more progressive electronic sound that weaves in between the Afrofuturism of indie R&B and post-dubstep experimentations. She also has more collaborators here than ever before, from the honey-voiced Jesse Boykins III to the slow and viscous flow of Chicago's Mick Jenkins. ""Interlude,"" which features Bibi Bourelly, is the strongest track, beginning with a warm guitar strum and a cold, steady coupling of drum machine and percolating synths. It sounds as fit for a singer as a rapper, and a large portion of the song is given to Bourelly. Like Dawn Richard’s ""Adderall/Sold (Outerlude),"" ""Interlude"" examine the pull of substances, the truth in things (pills, whiskey) that should only be temporarily enjoyable and not permanent solutions. Both songs are sad on the surface, but underneath is a level of hope: ""Staying busy working on my shit/ How else can I be great?"" Simz asks. More than most artists, Simz puts all her hope in her work; her work is her passion, the thing that helped her escape. There is a lot of despair in Simz’s lyrics, pulling against that hope. She raps of the trials of the brutalized black body, stripped of its humanity before it has a chance to grow and thrive (""They ain't even have the one-off chance to become the greatest,"" she raps on ""Kiki's Future"") as well as her desire to keep going, regardless. She raps, ""Still I'm hella angry at the system/ Young black woman, who the fuck is gonna listen to me now?"" knowing full well the things stacked against her (her gender, her race) and still she keeps pushing. AGE 101: DROP X is her 10th release. By now, we should know she's not kidding. Thank goodness for that.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21448-age-101-drop-x/,Self-released,2015.0
125,Anderson .Paak,Malibu,Pop/R&B,8.6,January 11 2016,Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,"It doesn’t take long to reach the heart of Anderson .Paak’s new album, Malibu. Just a minute into opening track ""The Birds,"" the West Coast-based rapper and singer/songwriter offers: ""My mama caught the gambling bug... My papa was behind them bars/ We never had to want for nuthin’/ Said all we ever need is love."" His voice is warm, strained, and conversational, like a Baptist minister or your favorite uncle schooling you, and the wide-open groove has an unhurried feel. It's immediately clear: This is a sincere, soulful project, brimming with honesty and humble perseverance. Brandon Anderson Paak has seen a lot in his 29 years. His mother was a farmer from South Korea, and his father served in the Air Force and later worked as a mechanic until he was sent to prison. ""I didn’t see him again until he was being buried,"" .Paak told Consequence of Sound in a 2015 interview. All of this life experience is reflected in Malibu, which is both his most assured and most personal project yet. .Paak's name is more prominent these days given his recent work on Dr. Dre’s Compton, where he appeared on six of 16 tracks, but even his sophomore album, 2014's Venice, showed flashes of brilliance. Venice was an easy listen; on Malibu, .Paak celebrates his progression by acknowledging where he’s come from, the trials he’s endured and things he’s seen. ""I spent years being called out my name, living under my greatness,"" .Paak asserts on ""The Season / Carry Me,"" a shape-shifting album highlight. He grew up performing in church, and on the song’s second half, you can hear a rich gospel flair in his voice: ""Ya moms in prison, ya father need a new kidney/ Ya family’s splittin’, rivalries between siblings/ If cash ain’t king, it’s damn sure the incentive."" Much like Kendrick Lamar, .Paak skillfully depicts his surroundings while remaining in the foreground. Kendrick's spirit feels present at many points on Malibu. .Paak's quicksilver flow on ""Your Prime"" feels teleported in directly from To Pimp a Butterfly as the music flows expansively from creamy soul harmonies to trap cadences. But .Paak is a confident and unique presence, with a strong command of style and genre as a producer and songwriter. He leapfrogs three eras in a festive suite of songs mid-album that examine heartbreak: '60s soul on ""Put Me Thru,"" club grooves on ""Am I Wrong,"" and '90s hip-hop on ""Without You."" His musical and emotional generosity ties everything together, making Malibu an expansive opus that flows in multiple directions like a classic '70s double album. Malibu is a community-oriented project, much like Chance the Rapper on last year's Surf, informed by voices from the past and full of guests who are given ample space to do their best work. The Game drops one of his most disarming, winning verses in a minute on ""Room in Here""; Rapsody flows affectingly about heartache over Dilla-style boom-bap. Many songs ride out on extended breakdowns, like ""Parking Lot,"" which feels like a studio band given room to stretch. On ""The Dreamer,"" the album’s celebratory final track, .Paak shares his success with his community, people who look like him and work to avoid similar pitfalls. ""Who cares ya daddy couldn’t be here/ Mama always kept the cable on/ I’m a product of the tube and the free lunch/ Living room, watching old reruns."" This is powerful art, not only for people of color, but for everyone who exists beyond societal constraints. It’s for those who’ve been told they don’t quite fit, those viewed through a different lens because of their circumstances. It’s a beautiful reminder that, no matter what you’ve endured, you can go anywhere and reach glorious heights.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21387-malibu/,"EMPIRE,OBE,Steel Wool,Art Club",2016.0
126,Prince,HITNRUN Phase Two,"Pop/R&B,Rock",4.7,January 8 2016,David Drake,Contributor,"As a thought experiment, it's fun to imagine how classic Prince records might sound to fresh ears, to guess how ""Kiss"" and ""I Would Die 4 U"" and ""1999"" might be received by someone raised in the Spotify era. He's a notoriously streaming-unfriendly artist, after all, and even as his reputation looms larger than ever, his art has become more difficult to obtain. What would someone vaguely familiar with the legend but completely new to the music discover? Well, a millions things obviously—a particular melodic sensibility, the urge to continually reinvent, the indelible stories, his undeniable chops, a restless creativity. But in concrete terms, Prince's best work took new, unfamiliar paths to familiar feelings. Established song forms rebuilt the ""wrong"" way, Prince's discography has a stiff, funky, uncanny-valley relationship with the pop that came before. And this is why HITNRUN Phase Two is an underwhelming entry in the artist formerly known as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince's canon. Relative to the idiosycratic and all-over-the place first iteration of the HITNRUN series, Phase Two is an organic-textured, polished, and predictable release. From beginning to end, Prince seems more interested in establishing his proficiency with pop forms, demonstrating his facility with the materials  to craft, as it were, a sturdy wooden table. Rather than an artist's interpretation, we get a craftman's tracing. This is in part due to the absence of Joshua Welton, formerly of forgotten R&B group Fatty Koo. Welton  co-produced the bulk of the first HITNRUN album, accenting it with EDM flourishes in a way that felt mildly adventurous. Without them, the record feels bland. But ultimately it's a lack of ideas that sinks this record, a point which hits home every time these songs overtly or subliminally recall one song or another in pop music history. Whether the references are knowing (a nod to Prince's own ""Kiss"" partway through dancefloor record ""Stare"") or simply dial up favorites from R&B's celestial jukebox (the extended highlight ""Groovy Potential"" surely recalls Oliver Cheatham's ""Get Down Saturday Night""), the songs rarely cohere into unique shapes. Or when they do, there's something quaint and mediated about the whole ordeal: the swaggering protagonists of ""Stare,"" (""Now we got the sound that's popping in the street"") may have the ""party going ham"" but the strutting feels calculated and theatrical. We also get the waltz of ""When She Comes,"" like an action-figure version of Otis Redding's ""I've Got Dreams to Remember,"" or the ludicrous chorus of garage-rock vehicle ""Screwdriver,"" which was first premiered in 2013 and could have been written for the Hives. Lyrics tend to be forgettably symbolic; ""I'm in the big city when I'm in your arms."" I mean, sure? This is perhaps most jarring on topical opener ""Baltimore,"" which not only strikes a bum note tonally—the reassuriningly jaunty vibe is miles away from ""Alright""—but just seems lazy: ""We're tired of crying, and people dying/ Let's take all the guns away."" OK, so no one needs Prince to offer policy positions, but in contrast with even the hippy idealism of his incredible '90s anti-gun anthem ""Love Sign,"" ""Baltimore"" suggests complete creative fatigue. The redeeming moments are ones which make some unpredictable moves—any shocks are welcome on a record as polite and poised as this. Near the end comes ""Revelation,"" a spare version of an Isley Brothers-style ballad which holds attention by withholding. Prince's vocal performance has a touching grace, but what makes the song work is its subversive refusal to entirely exist: it feels like a shadow. But perhaps the album's true star is ""Xtraloveable,"" a silly record with an amusing chorus conceit: ""Whenever you need someone to take a shower with, call me up, please."" It strikes a rare relatable-goofy balance, and like 2014's ""Breakfast Can Wait"" or 2015's ""1000 X's and O's,"" this gives the record some weight and substance. It's a bit odd to imagine that shower sex is the most exciting part of Prince's day—after all, he's still a superstar living in a $10 million Paisley Park estate—but no reason not to take what you can get.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21353-hitnrun-phase-two/,NPG,2015.0
127,David Bowie,Blackstar,Rock,8.5,January 7 2016,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"David Bowie has died many deaths yet he is still with us. He is popular music’s ultimate Lazarus: Just as that Biblical figure was beckoned by Jesus to emerge from his tomb after four days of nothingness, Bowie has put many of his selves to rest over the last half-century, only to rise again with a different guise. This is astounding to watch, but it's more treacherous to live through; following Lazarus’ return, priests plotted to kill him, fearing the power of his story. And imagine actually being such a miracle man—resurrection is a hard act to follow. Bowie knows all this. He will always have to answer to his epochal work of the 1970s, the decade in which he dictated several strands of popular and experimental culture, when he made reinvention seem as easy as waking up in the morning. Rather than trying to outrun those years, as he did in the '80s and '90s, he is now mining them in a resolutely bizarre way that scoffs at greatest-hits tours, nostalgia, and brainless regurgitation. His new off-Broadway musical is called Lazarus, and it turns Bowie’s penchant for avatars into an intriguing shell game: The disjointed production features actor Michael C. Hall doing his best impression of Bowie’s corrupted, drunk, and immortal alien from the 1976 art film The Man Who Fell to Earth. Trapped in a set that mimics a Manhattan penthouse, Hall presses himself up to his high skyscraper windows as he sings a new Bowie song also called ""Lazarus."" ""This way or no way, you know, I’ll be free,"" he sings, smudging his hands against the glass. ""Just like that bluebird."" Bowie sings the same song on Blackstar, an album that has him clutching onto remnants from the past as exploratory jazz and the echos of various mad men soundtrack his freefall. Following years of troubling silence, Bowie returned to the pop world with 2013’s The Next Day. The goodwill surrounding his return could not overcome the album’s overall sense of stasis, though. Conversely, on Blackstar, he embraces his status as a no-fucks icon, a 68-year-old with ""nothing left to lose,"" as he sings on ""Lazarus."" The album features a quartet of brand-new collaborators, led by the celebrated modern jazz saxophonist Donny McCaslin, whose repertoire includes hard bop as well as skittering Aphex Twin covers. Bowie’s longtime studio wingman Tony Visconti is back as co-producer, bringing along with him some continuity and a sense of history. Because as much as Blackstar shakes up our idea of what a David Bowie record can sound like, its blend of jazz, codes, brutality, drama, and alienation is not without precedent in his work. Bowie’s first proper instrument was a saxophone, after all, and as a preteen he looked up to his older half-brother Terry Burns, who exposed him to John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, and Beat Generation ideals. The links connecting Bowie, his brother, and jazz feel significant. Burns suffered from schizophrenia throughout his life; he once tried to kill himself by jumping out of a mental hospital window and eventually committed suicide by putting himself in front of a train in 1985. Perhaps this helps explain why Bowie has often used jazz and his saxophone not for finger-snapping pep but rather to hint at mystery and unease. It’s there in his close collaborations with avant-jazz pianist Mike Garson, from 1973’s ""Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)"" all the way to 2003’s ""Bring Me the Disco King."" It’s in his wild squawks on 1993’s ""Jump They Say,"" an ode to Burns. But there is no greater example of the pathos that makes Bowie’s saxophone breathe than on ""Subterraneans"" from 1977’s Low, one of his most dour (and influential) outré moments. That song uncovered a mood of future nostalgia so lasting that it’s difficult to imagine the existence of an act like Boards of Canada without it. Completing the circle, Boards of Canada were reportedly one of Bowie’s inspirations for Blackstar. At this point, it is all but impossible for Bowie to escape himself, but that doesn’t mean he won’t try. Thematically, Blackstar pushes on with the world-weary nihilism that has marked much of his work this century. ""It’s a head-spinning dichotomy of the lust for life against the finality of everything,"" he mused around the release of 2003’s Reality. ""It’s those two things raging against each other… that produces these moments that feel like real truth."" Those collisions come hard and strong throughout the album, unpredictable jazz solos and spirited vocals meeting timeless stories of blunt force and destruction. The rollicking ""'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore"" gets its name from a controversial 17th-century play in which a man has sex with his sister only to stab her in the heart in the middle of a kiss. Bowie’s twist involves some canny gender-bending (""she punched me like a dude""), a robbery, and World War I, but the gist is the same—humans will always resort to a language of savagery when necessary, no matter where or when. See also: ""Girl Loves Me,"" which has Bowie yelping in the slang originated by A Clockwork Orange’s ultraviolent droogs. Though this mix of jazz, malice, and historical role-play is intoxicating, Blackstar becomes whole with its two-song denouement, which balances out the bruises and blood with a couple of salty tears. These are essentially classic David Bowie ballads, laments in which he lets his mask hang just enough for us to see the creases of skin behind it. ""Dollar Days"" is the confession of a restless soul who could not spend his golden years in a blissful British countryside even if he wanted to. ""I’m dying to push their backs against the grain and fool them all again and again,"" he sings, the words doubling as a mantra for Blackstar and much of Bowie’s career. Then, on ""I Can’t Give Everything Away,"" he once again sounds like a frustrated Lazarus, stymied by a returning pulse. This tortured immortality is no gimmick: Bowie will live on long after the man has died. For now, though, he’s making the most of his latest reawakening, adding to the myth while the myth is his to hold.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21332-blackstar/,"Columbia,RCA,ISO",2016.0
128,Lizzo,Big GRRRL Small World,Rap,7.5,December 10 2015,Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,"Twin Cities artist Lizzo seems to have fans and collaborators in just about every pocket of the music world: Sleater-Kinney invited her to open for their reunion tour; fellow Minneapolitan Prince featured Lizzo and bandmate Sophia Eris on last year's PLECTRUMELECTRUM; Ryan Olson produced much of her debut LIZZOBANGERS. She's a true triple threat, equally searing as a rapper, soul singer, and personality and an unstoppable force on record, as amply proven with single ""Batches and Cookies"" (and its buttered-up hunkfest of a video) and with previous groups GRRRL PARTY and the Chalice. Big GRRRL Small World comes off as the work of an already minted star—her introduction to the small world, which she's already stepped over, laughing. Big GRRRL Small World—named for a line on LIZZOBANGERS, and Lizzo's label BGSW, on which she released the album—finds her reckoning with her sudden fame, and also the things that plague it: white culture vultures, terrible dudes (consigned on ""Ride"" to the ""Support Group for Men Without Lizzo,"" a demolishingly hilarious couple of bars), people who need her references RapGenius'd clear for them, needy people, misogynists. It's all delivered with sheer glee, and some of it is among the most wicked fun committed to record in 2015. It also sounds gorgeous; largely produced by BJ Burton (Low, Sylvan Esso, Poliça), the album is full of unexpected turns and immaculate codas. Lizzo bends each track to her will, twisting them until they're anything but obvious. ""Ain't I"", the closest thing here to a LIZZOBANGER, begins with references to reparations and Russian czars but ends with a distant, slightly untuned piano interlude and distorted guitar squeals. The ballads speak the language of vulnerability but twist R&B tropes to different ends. Standout single ""Humanize"" begins as a shimmering post-coital reverie sung in feather-soft voice and ends smothering and alone, with a voice like the feather's sharp end. Lizzo's lyrics on ""Humanize"" complicate everything, full of reversals (""your skin is warm—it keeps me up though I am tired"") and pinprick-perfect lines: ""No, you can't lay on my shoulder, there are spikes and scales and your cheek would just press them in."" It's an exhausted, near-existential sigh: one of yearning for connection but unable to find it, particularly when the ones you're supposed to connect with are the aforementioned terrible dudes. ""En Love"" begins as another sumptuous soul piece, Lizzo's besotten cooing resting upon beds of '90s synth pads, until Lizzo drops the punchline—""with myself!""—and turns the track into a trap jam. Lizzo's force of personality prevents the switch up from being mere gimmick, as does her generosity; she dedicates a verse to her best friend, and to her listeners. Indeed, the most straightforward tracks on Big GRRRL Small World, such as empowerment ballad ""My Skin"", are explicitly about and for everyone who looks like and looks up to her. This—not only her indie friends, or her crystalline production, and especially not her place in any made-up taxonomy of female rappers she's been placed into—is largely responsible for her whirlwind success, and Lizzo knows it. ""I love that because I am a woman and because I rap and I look the way I look, I can connect with the demographic of people who feel like they have a voice in me,"" Lizzo told Billboard. ""I get to speak to these people who did not get spoken for in this genre."" Big GRRRL Small World succeeds because it's just that: a showcase for the small world, a keepsake for the big grrrls. Correction: An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that Bon Iver's Justin Vernon produced LIZZOBANGERS.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21312-big-grrrl-small-world/,BGSW,2015.0
129,John Coltrane,A Love Supreme: The Complete Masters,Jazz,10.0,November 25 2015,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"John Coltrane was a late bloomer. Born in 1926, the same year as Miles Davis, he spent his twenties in and out of small-time bands, a promising journeyman moving between playing jazz and the more bar-friendly music that was starting to be called R&B. During these early years he had problems with narcotics and alcohol, alternating stretches of heroin use with periods of binge drinking. Charlie Parker—every sax player's hero when Coltrane was coming up in the 1940s and '50s—had given the junkie life a romantic aura for some naive souls, connecting drug use with creativity. But the underachieving Coltrane was a run-of-the-mill addict, someone broke and in ill health whose habit clearly kept him stuck in place. He was fired from Miles Davis' band in 1957 for showing up on the bandstand dressed in shabby clothes and visibly drunk—by some accounts he took a punch from the trumpeter before being given his walking papers. And if Coltrane had spiraled and his career had ended there, he'd be remembered now as a musician who flamed out just as he was discovering his voice. But that's not what happened. Everything changed for Coltrane in 1957 when, as he wrote in the liner notes to his defining album, A Love Supreme, he ""experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life."" During that year, Coltrane stopped drinking and kicked heroin, and from that point forward, his career would unfold with an almost frightening amount of focus and intensity. These final 10 years are when Coltrane made his mark on the world of jazz as a leader, and he was then seemingly always on the move, in transition, each moment glimpsed as a blur on a continuum rather than a fixed point in space. He wasn't just covering ground, he was accelerating, and every phase of his later career has the attendant feeling of stomach-dropping free-fall, of being pushed forcefully into new places. A Love Supreme, recorded with what was later called his classic quartet, is Coltrane's musical expression of his 1957 epiphany. It's the sound of a man laying his soul bare. Structured as a suite and delivered in praise of God, everything about the record is designed for maximum emotional impact, from Elvin Jones' opening gong crash to the soft rain of McCoy Tyner's piano clusters to Coltrane's stately fanfare to Jimmy Garrison's iconic four-note bassline to the spoken chant by Coltrane—""a-LOVE-su-PREME, a-LOVE-su-PREME""—that carries out the opening movement, ""Acknowledgement"". By the time the record gets to the closing ""Psalm"", which finds Coltrane interpreting on his saxophone the syllables of a poem he'd written to the Creator, A Love Supreme has wrung its concept dry, extracting every drop of feeling from Coltrane's initial vision. It's as complete a statement as exists in recorded jazz. Hearing it now as part of this exhaustive 3xCD set, which gathers every scrap of material recorded during the sessions as well as a live performance of the suite from later the same year, you get a clearer sense than ever before of the different forms A Love Supreme might have taken, and how Coltrane's desire to communicate something specific and profound led to its final shape. A Love Supreme is also one of the most popular albums in the last 60 years of jazz, selling the kind of numbers usually reserved for pop (it quickly sold more than 100,000 copies, and has almost certainly sold more than a million since). If Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is the most frequently bought first jazz album for those curious about the genre, A Love Supreme is easily number two. But though they were released just seven years apart, there's a world of difference between the two records, and the success of A Love Supreme is trickier to explain. For all its structural daring, Kind of Blue also functions as an ambient record, with slower tempos and a late-night vibe. A Love Supreme is harder to get a handle on. If you can think of Coltrane's work on a continuum, from the gorgeous melodicism of ""My Favorite Things"" or Ballads or his album with Duke Ellington on one end and the brutal noise assault of the 1966 concerts collected on Concert in Japan on the other, A Love Supreme sits perfectly at the fulcrum, challenging enough to continually reveal new aspects but accessible enough to inspire newcomers. Coltrane may have structured the record for just this effect. He had already been further ""out"" than the music heard on A Love Supreme, including some of the knotty extended jams like ""Chasin' the Trane"" recorded at his 1961 sessions at the Village Vanguard. He was fascinated with the innovations of Ornette Coleman from the minute he heard them in the late '50s, and though he never completely abandoned chord changes, he regularly flirted with atonality, improvising outside of a fixed key. With A Love Supreme, it was almost as though Coltrane knew he had to dial things back a little in order to share his message of spiritual rebirth with a wider audience. Though conventionally beautiful in many ways, A Love Supreme is, for many, the exact point beyond which jazz becomes too experimental. It's possible to hear on this set how the album might have gone even further. At a time when a single track might have a dozen collaborators working on it over the course of weeks, it's a little mind-boggling to consider that the music on A Love Supreme was recorded on a single day, December 9, 1964. This wasn't uncommon for jazz records of the time. But though they had the music in the can from that first day, Coltrane wanted to try something else. So on December 10, he called the young tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp, and a second bassist, Art Davis to play with his quartet. The six musicians then ran through two versions of A Love Supreme's opening ""Acknowledgment"", so that Coltrane could explore what the music might sound like with another horn and additional low-end rhythm. Shepp was an up-and-comer deeply influenced by Coltrane; the two takes of ""Acknowledgment"" featuring Shepp find him serving as a kind of textural counterpoint, his more brittle and biting tone commenting on the melody from an oblique angle and hinting at possibilities existing outside of the version recorded the day before. You sense a more abrasive road not taken, one that almost certainly would have found a smaller audience. We hear a different perspective on the fantastic live version of the suite recorded in France five months after the album's release. Five months in '60s Coltrane time was like a decade in the career of other jazz musicians, and he was already imbuing the A Love Supreme material with an extra intensity. Tyner's clanging chords on ""Resolution"" have a harsher edge, and Coltrane's attendant soloing is much rougher and more pointed, his notes seeming to attack the structure of the composition from several directions rather than floating along above it. This is the hard-blowing sound that Coltrane would show on Meditations, another spiritually focused album-length suite recorded later in 1965 that never had a chance at A Love Supreme's level of mainstream acceptance. In the same year, Coltrane would also record Om and Ascension, two harsh and challenging pieces of music that strain against the boundaries of what most people would even consider music. Given what surrounds it, and how sweet and gentle it so often is, A Love Supreme was an expression of a very specific time and place, a conscious attempt by Coltrane to communicate something to his audience that was broad enough to be understood but rich and complex enough to honor both where he was as a musician and the depth of the subject matter. A Love Supreme sounds like nothing else in John Coltrane's discography, and indeed like little else in recorded jazz, sitting at the nexus of so many competing musical ideas. The final piece of the A Love Supreme equation concerns the civil rights movement and black liberation, and how those swirling ideas were inextricably tangled up with the jazz avant-garde.  Coltrane was never overtly political, but he did allow his thoughts and feelings to bleed into his music. Coltrane met Malcolm X, wrote a piece for Martin Luther King Jr., and his 1963 dirge ""Alabama"", a piece with a close tonal connection to A Love Supreme's ""Psalm"", was written to commemorate the four girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing that year. As the '60s wore on, politically conscious ""fire jazz"" grew in currency, much of it directly inspired by Coltrane's music, but during his life he never quite felt the need to connect his music to specific social currents, even as others drew inspiration from it in that context. Coltrane was seeking something broader, communing with God as he understood it. For Coltrane, that spiritual journey led him to A Love Supreme, which became the base he'd explore from during his short time left on Earth. Coltrane occupies a unique position in jazz history. He was famous, especially in the jazz world, but he wasn't really a personality. He was not inclined toward interviews and he wasn't very good at them, preferring to let the music speak for itself. He didn't have the mystery of a Thelonious Monk, the tragic genius of a Charlie Parker, the cool comfort with celebrity or flamboyance of a Miles Davis, the combative verbal dexterity of Charles Mingus, the theoretical underpinnings of Ornette Coleman, the comfort with the mainstream of Louis Armstrong, or the symbolic stature of Duke Ellington. He led a quiet life, putting everything into his music. His chaotic years mostly came when he was an unknown; by the time he was a major jazz figure, almost his entire life was music. If he wasn't on stage or in a recording studio, he was practicing or studying records. Seemingly every other story of an encounter with Coltrane in the 1960s involved him in a room with a saxophone in his hand, playing scales.

130,A Tribe Called Quest,People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,Rap,10.0,November 13 2015,kris ex,Contributor,"Approaching A Tribe Called Quest's seminal debut in 2015 is a loaded venture. The Queens, N.Y. trio (and sometimes ""y"" quartet, counting Jarobi) is one of the most revered acts in hip-hop—and with good reason. As part of the Afrocentric and innovative Native Tongues collective—which included De La Soul,  Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, Black Sheep, and others—they created and refined a template for '90s hip-hop that was street-astute, worldly, and more inspirational than aspirational. Even without the Native Tongues' legacy, Tribe's heritage is not a light one. There's no stretch in saying that, without A Tribe Called Quest, the biggest rap artists of this year—Drake, Future, and Kendrick Lamar—would not exist as they do. Drake would not be Drake without Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak; Kanye would not be Kanye without his Tribe influences. Without Tribe, the Dungeon Family—birthplace of Outkast, Goodie Mob, and Future—arguably does not exist. And the improvisational looseness of Kendrick's opus is unthinkable without the innumerable branches of jazz and hip-hop sprouting from Tribe's experimentation, which differed significantly from the cooler jazz-sample leanings of Stetsasonic and Gang Starr. There's no Mos Def, no J. Cole, no Common, no J Dilla, no Digable Planets, no Neptunes, and no Clipse as we know them. Tribe is that important. And this album—the first ever to receive a perfect ""5 Mic"" rating from The Source magazine—is where it all began. Arriving a year after De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising, People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm showed Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jarobi to be whimsical yet grounded in reality. They weren't heady, hermetic, and puzzling like De La; in comparison to 3 Feet High's astounding range and informative sound collages, People's Instinctive Travels was clean and focused. Where De La went wide musically, Tribe went deep; where De La was deep and dense lyrically, Tribe went wide and abstract. That both projects managed to do all they were able to do and remain fun is one of the great wonders of hip-hop's first golden age. Encountered now, in 2015,  A People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm feels like a palette cleanser. Considered with Kendrick Lamar's layered and angsty self-examination on To Pimp A Butterfly, the blunting and numbing escapist bounce of Future's DS2, and Drake's bombastic and moody mythological affirmations from If You're Reading This It's Too Late, it's an album that's largely focused outside of itself and its creators. There are three added cuts for this reissue—remixes by Pharrell, J. Cole, and CeeLo—that are passable and melodic but unneeded. Tribe's music needs no updating, even when it sticks out like a sore thumb, because that's exactly what it did in 1990. ""I Left My Wallet In El Segundo"", with its eight-bar flip of the Chamber Brothers' ""Funky"" and Wes Anderson-like narrative, is sparse and simple. But it more than stands up, thanks in no small part to Bob Power's remastering, which makes everything sound fuller and crisper and which uses the empty space between the newly clarified sounds to create groove and warmth. On a fresh listen, the reason ""Bonita Applebum"" (powered largely by a generous  sample of  Ramp's ""Daylight"") is still considered one the best loved songs hip-hop has ever produced becomes clear—musically it's sunny and spry, capturing blushes of virgin courtship. It's objectifying, but respectful; cocksure but awkward; flattering and freaky: Q-Tip praises his desired's ""elaborate eyes,"" promises to ""kiss you where some brothers won't"" and offers that, ""So far, I hope you like rap songs."" The rhymes here are at once conversational and repressed, the topics concurrently large and small. Diet is tackled on ""Ham 'N' Eggs"" with Tip and Phife rhyming in tandem, ""A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?/ Some veggie links and some fish that stinks/ Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house/ Smelled like she conjured up a mouse. "" Sexual fidelity and STD's are dealt with on ""Pubic Enemy"" via ""Old King Cole"" who ""wore the crown but not the jimmy hat"" until one day ""the fair maiden in the royal bedroom/ Caught the king scratching."" Sex and safe sex were at the forefront of Q-Tip's mind—props (women) are referred to often, and the most important thing about retrieving his wallet from El Segundo seems to be reclaiming his ""props' numbers"" and condoms, or ""jimmy hats."" The group is marked for their social consciousness, but not merely because of their awareness, but their ability to wax simultaneously about politics and art. On ""Push It Along"", Tip traverses police brutality, community unity, and rap dreams in a few bars, managing to be an approachable advocate for responsibility without seeming didactic: ""The pigs are wearing blue/ And in a year or two/  We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe / What we gonna do? Save me and my brothers?/ Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers?/ Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule rap/ We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?"" The lyrics are 25 years old. But were they released today they'd seem right on time, while being out of place—because all these many years later People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm is more than a nostalgia artifact. It's a worthy listen, not because of what it was, but because of what it is.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21218-peoples-instinctive-travels-and-the-paths-of-rhythm/,"Legacy,Legacy",1990.0
131,Amy Winehouse,AMY: The Original Soundtrack,Pop/R&B,5.4,November 6 2015,Jia Tolentino,Contributor,"There are several ways one might construct a soundtrack for AMY, the compassionate and horrifying Amy Winehouse documentary chronicling her brief, doomed arc through superstardom. The obvious choice would be to make the soundtrack 100% Amy, whether through covers (the tactic of the soundtrack for the Nina Simone documentary What Happened, Miss Simone?) or through Winehouse's own voice. But in the AMY: The Original Soundtrack, Amy Winehouse is actually outnumbered: her 11 B-sides are broken up evenly by 11 snippets of film score, with the balance tipped by one exceedingly unnecessary trip-hop track, originally released in 1995. This is not for lack of material. Winehouse began her public singing career at age 16 with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, performing and recording regularly for the next decade until her death. She's already had one posthumous compilation album (2011's poorly named, respectability-minded Lioness: Hidden Treasures), but if the tracks available on YouTube are any indication—let alone the unreleased professional recordings that her still-active fanbase lists and obsesses over on message boards—there are plenty of demos, live versions, and discarded mixes left. AMY: The Original Soundtrack, however, contains only one true ""new"" recording. ""We're Still Friends"", performed live at the Union Chapel in 2006, shows Winehouse on the cusp between her peak and downfall; the recording is precise and elegant, and she wears her strung-out voice like a crown. The rest of the soundtrack is a mix of album cuts and live recordings, compiled primarily as signposts for the documentary's plot. There is no raw audio on the soundtrack whatsoever; it's much glossier than the film itself, which heavily relies on rough footage and successfully illuminates Winehouse outside her press narrative as a result. In AMY, it's arresting to watch her so unguarded, putting her makeup on in a bar bathroom before a gig, giving a tour of her apartment in character as a haughty maid. Her talent flames into incandescence and out of it; her flesh shrinks into bone. She's frequently captured singing in the film, from ""Happy Birthday"" at a friend's house to that gruesome final show in Belgrade, where she was essentially walking dead. The collage is forceful, and in context you barely notice that the film is scored at all. The soundtrack, then, serves as your reminder. Antonio Pinto, who wrote the music for both City of God and City of Men, even has the opening track. It's a minimal, mournful minute of piano. ""This is sad, remember,"" the song says. ""What's about to happen is very, very solemn."" But could there be anything that requires saying less? Presumably, the instrumental interludes are meant to give her tragic arc some breathing room, like asterisks that break up a story. But one of the best things about the AMY documentary is that its pacing feels so natural—invisibly punishing, just like life. The effect of this soundtrack is exactly the opposite. The power of her voice is undercut by the regular intrusion of the film score, which doesn't reference her musically in palette or instrumentation. As a result, the album feels like a powerful hand clasping a limp one. Winehouse had an essential personal relentlessness, which her audience reflected back at her, and the soundtrack to a movie that climaxes at her death has no right to hide or diminish that. Everyone already knew that Winehouse was a genius vocalist. To its credit, this collection highlights her sardonic writing, choosing songs where she translated her life cuttingly, always with a twist. She was happy to project her true self outward just enough to disguise it as a persona; she was stuck on the same themes of self-aggrandizement and self-diminishment, and she was almost supernaturally ahead of the story. As her pianist says in the documentary, she ""needed music like a person, and would die for it""—and she was ready to, and did. ""Rehab"" was a distraction by way of being right on the nose; her many admissions (""It's not just my pride, it's just 'til these tears have dried"") made us complicit. Back to Black uses depression as a euphemism for heroin in the title. Even ""Tears Dry on Their Own"", her black-swan sequel to ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", contains a withdrawal metaphor. The latter is reproduced in its original album version on AMY, which is fine, because what does a rarity mean in the age of YouTube, anyway? What could be new, in this context, when the star in question was hounded to death by demons so public we all saw her crack pipe and paparazzi so relentless that they slept outside her house? This soundtrack album doesn't even seem aware of those questions, and like any album bearing Amy Winehouse's name from 2011 onwards, it's a diminishment—this time severe.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21214-amy-the-original-soundtrack/,Island,2015.0
132,Mac Miller,GO:OD AM,Rap,7.3,October 8 2015,Tayler Montague,Contributor,"Who is Mac Miller? On Blue Slide Park, he was a childish ""frat rapper"" who made dumb jokes about smoking weed and referred to the vagina as a ""cooter."" On the claustrophobic Watching Movies With the Sound Off, he was rapping in a pitched-down voice alongside Earl Sweatshirt and Ab-Soul about friends lost, drugs consumed, depression, and the trappings of success. And on the transparent, relaxed GO:OD AM, he sounds like someone’s troubled little brother made good: from the album’s opening horns, you can sense that this is a victory lap for Mac, a homecoming. From start to finish, this is his most refined and well put-together project. Getting through the 16 tracks on Blue Slide Park was like an endurance test, and even the deeper and much-improved Watching Movies started to sound interchangeable before it ended. The beats on GO:OD AM have a New York, boom-bap feel, with lots of jazz samples and harder drums, and it’s both more varied and more upbeat, from the trap-sounding beats of  ""When in Rome"" or the Chief Keef-featuring ""Cut the Check"" to love songs like ""ROS"" or the Miguel collaboration ""The Weekend"". Miller said he recorded 400 songs for Watching, and sometimes you couldn’t help but wonder about the selection process (""Objects in the Mirror""?) but on GO:OD AM, he’s learned to self-edit. Lyrically, Mac offers a music industry ""Scared Straight"". ""I’ve seen some motherfucking shit,"" he warns on ""Two Matches"". The interlude before ""God Speed"" includes a voicemail from his brother, checking in on him at a low point in his life, and later on in the song, he admits: ""White lines be numbing them dark times/ Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up/ Admit it’s a problem, I need a wake up/ Before one morning, I don’t wake up."" It’s funny to hear a 23-year-old who just kicked his habit and could be considered a kid himself refer regretfully to ""all the kids doing drugs"" on ""In the Bag"", but Mac has enough of his sense of humor intact to keep the album from playing like a D.A.R.E. campaign on wax. On ""God Speed"", the album’s standout track, he pays tribute to the close friends in his Most Dope Family, especially his right hand man Q, and it’s genuinely touching. ""Everybody saying I need rehab/ So I’m speeding with a blindfold on/ It won’t be long before they watching me crash/ And they don’t wanna see that,"" he raps, thanking the people that got him through the toughest time of his life. He’s never preachy, though: He sounds refreshed and rejuvenated, like someone who has been going for daily walks, eating veggies and drinking fruit smoothies every day. Many songs here reference his status as a white rapper, signaling his awareness of the rap game’s perception of him: ""I’m a white rapper/ They always call me shady,"" he says on ""Brand Name"", just a few minutes into the album. ""I know niggas think you white and you not about to go in with these bars,"" chimes in Domo Genesis on ""In the Bag"". There’s a kind of authenticity to him that has been there since the beginning, if you look for it: He doesn’t rap about breaking the law, because he’s not about that life. He’s a corny white rapper (meant as a compliment) who loves his family, friends, and hometown. We might not learn a lot of specifics about him, but there’s a lot of honesty in his music if you look for it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21038-mac-miller-good-am/,Warner Bros.,2015.0
133,David Bowie,Five Years 1969-1973,Rock,8.2,October 1 2015,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"""Not only is this the last show of the tour"", David Bowie announced at London's Hammersmith Odeon on June 3, 1973 by way of introduction to ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"", ""but it is the last show we will ever do."" The recording of that nugget of rock history appears in this box collecting most of Bowie's music from the years of his ascent, so let's take him at his word for a moment. Imagine that Five Years (allegedly the first of a series, though Bowie has always announced many more projects than he's released) was all the documentation there was of his musical career—that he'd entered the public sphere with his 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", retired from the stage after the Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane tour, and vanished to a Tibetan mountaintop following a loving salute to his roots, Pin Ups. He'd certainly be some kind of glam-rock legend, even more than his friend and rival Marc Bolan. He probably wouldn't have the enduring cultural cachet he commands in our world, but there would still be a fervent cult around his three great albums and three iffy-to-good ones, and even more interest in his live recordings and ephemera. To put it differently, Hedwig and the Angry Inch would be the same; LCD Soundsystem wouldn't. In our world, though, Five Years is only a slice of a much longer curve. The earliest album in the box, 1969's *David Bowie—*a.k.a. Space Oddity, a.k.a. *Man of Words/Man of Music—*wasn't Bowie's recorded debut, or even his first self-titled album. (In fact, there could theoretically be a Five Years 1964-1968, tracing his evolution from rock 'n' roll wannabe to fussy vaudevillean, although it would mostly be kind of awful.) It was, however, a follow-up to his first successful single, a haunting novelty record about a lost astronaut that had been released a week and a half before the moon landing. The young singer/acoustic guitarist behind these songs obviously has a mountain of charisma, a gift for hooks, and a taste for the language of experimental science fiction, and not the faintest idea what to do with them most of the time. So he wears his influences on his sleeve (""Letter to Hermione"" is intensely Tim Buckley-ish; ""Memory of a Free Festival"" is a hippie rewrite of ""Hey Jude""), and constantly overreaches for dramatic effect. As it turns out, what he really needed was a good hard rock'n'roll band. Bowie assembled a very short-lived group called the Hype with guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist Tony Visconti; by the time they recorded The Man Who Sold the World in April, 1970, they'd picked up drummer Mick ""Woody"" Woodmansey, and gone back to using their singer's name. The Man Who Sold the World is the dark horse of the Bowie catalog. There were no singles issued from it, and the title track didn't really become a standard until Nirvana covered it decades later. But toughening up the arrangements made Bowie's stagey warble vastly more effective, and a lot of his artistic risks paid off: the album's opener is a ferocious eight-minute metal sci-fi opus, ""The Width of a Circle"", with some of the most overtly homoerotic lyrics a pop musician had ever intoned (""He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips/ And showed me the leather belt 'round his hips""). The theme of shifting sexual identity became the core of Bowie's next album, 1971's scattered but splendid Hunky Dory: ""Gotta make way for the Homo Superior,"" he squeals on the gay-bar singalong ""Oh! You Pretty Things"", simultaneously nodding to Nietzsche and to X-Men. He'd also made huge leaps as a songwriter, and his new songs demonstrated the breadth of his power: the epic Jacques Brel-gone-Dada torch song ""Life on Mars?"" is immediately followed by ""Kooks"", an adorable lullaby for his infant son. The band (with Trevor Bolder replacing Visconti on bass) mostly keeps its power in check—""Changes"" is effectively Bowie explaining his aesthetic to fans of the Carpenters. Still, they cut loose on the album's most brilliant jewel, ""Queen Bitch"", a furiously rocking theatrical miniature (Bowie-the-character-actor has rarely chewed the scenery harder) that out-Velvet Undergrounds the Velvet Underground. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars from 1972 was the record that made Bowie the star he'd been acting like for a while, although its reputation isn't quite the same as its reality. It was mostly recorded before Hunky Dory was released; it purports to be a concept album, but doesn't actually have a coherent concept. (""Starman"", ""Suffragette City"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" were all late additions to its running order.) It is, nonetheless, a fantastic set of songs, overflowing with huge riffs and huger personae. ""Five Years"" opens the album with Bowie's grandest sci-fi apocalypse yet, Mick Ronson shreds his way to the guitar pantheon, and the band's flamboyant performance of ""Starman"" on Top of the Pops famously gave the next generation of British pop musicians a bunch of funny tingling sensations. The whole album, in fact, is as erotically charged as an orgone accumulator: Bowie was probably the only person who could have remained sexually ambiguous after declaring ""I'm gay, and always have been."" Aladdin Sane, recorded while Bowie and the Spiders were touring their asses off in an attempt to get America to love them the way England already did, is effectively Ziggy Stardust II, a harder-rocking if less original variation on the hit album. There's a paranoid sci-fi scenario (""Panic in Detroit""), a blues-rock stomp (""The Jean Genie""), a bit of cabaret (""Time""), a blunt sex-and-drugs nightmare (""Cracked Actor""). The big difference is that where Ziggy ended with a vision of outreach to the front row (""Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful!""), Aladdin is all alienation and self-conscious artifice, parodic gestures of intimacy directed to the theater balcony. Bowie overenunciates his cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" to turn it into a caricature of a disinterested Casanova; his sneering rocker ""Watch That Man"" is a better evocation of the Stones themselves. Then there's Pin Ups, a quick-and-sloppy covers album that's more interesting in theory than in practice. The repertoire is the songs he'd heard in London clubs when he'd been starting out as a professional musician (less than a decade earlier), and that had shaped his idea of rock: music by the Yardbirds, the Who, the Pretty Things, and the like. (In other words, not so much his idols as contemporaries who found their audience before he did.) But the original versions of every one of those songs are vastly better, because Bowie doesn't have much to say through any of them, and covers up for it through cruise-ship-entertainer oversinging. His art, in those days, was an art of persona, and songs like ""Sorrow"" and ""See Emily Play"" didn't have much to offer it. The band was falling apart, too: the Spiders' drummer Woody Woodmansey had been replaced by Aynsley Dunbar (a veteran of the same London scene), and Ronson and Bolder were gone by the next time Bowie recorded. Bowie released six studio albums in the '69-'73 period, but Five Years is a 12-disc set. The Ziggy film soundtrack, a document of that allegedly final stage performance that was first released a decade later, appears in its expanded, two-disc 2003 form, complete with a 15-minute ""The Width of a Circle"" and unnecessary Jacques Brel and Velvet Underground covers (still no sign of the songs on which Jeff Beck played at that gig, though). Live Santa Monica '72, a radio broadcast that was bootlegged for decades and officially issued in 2008, is included here too. Ziggy Stardust itself appears in both its original mix and co-producer Ken Scott's 2003 remix, which is frankly not all that different. The selling point here for Bowiephiles who probably have all of that stuff already is the two-disc Re:Call 1 (its title cheekily adapts the old RCA Records logo's typeface), a collection of material that only appeared on singles. Some of them are triflingly different mono mixes, but there are a few fascinating oddities: both the never-previously-reissued 1970 dud ""Holy Holy"" and the much sharper 1971 remake that nearly made it onto Ziggy Stardust, both the frequently-reissued 1972 killer ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and the just-as-good 1973 remake that nearly made it onto Aladdin Sane, and a peculiar '71 single (released under the name The Arnold Corns) with larval versions of ""Hang On to Yourself"" and ""Moonage Daydream"", both of which were heavily rewritten for Ziggy. Still, Re:Call 1 is far from a complete collection of the officially issued recordings that Bowie made in the 1969-1973 era: there's no ""Sweet Head"" or ""Lightning Frightening"" or ""Bombers"", for instance, and it'd have been nice to include the version of ""The Supermen"" that he re-recorded in 1971 with the Spiders from Mars' classic lineup. Five Years doesn't really reconsider or recontextualize Bowie's first classic period—that was more the job of EMI's Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane reissues a decade ago, and their 2009 Space Oddity reissue. (The book included with the new set features producers' notes from Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, contemporary reviews of the albums and the final Ziggy show, and reproductions of ads, but nothing especially revelatory.) It's just a collection of some superb records, and some less good ones, from an interesting era of a major artist. If those five years had been all we'd gotten of Bowie, this would be an essential artifact. But they weren't, and the wonders that followed them make the scope of this box seem both over-inclusive and incomplete.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/,"Parlophone,Mercury,Philips,Mercury,Philips,Mercury,Mercury,RCA,RCA,RCA,RCA,RCA,RCA,RCA,RCA,Virgin,RCA,RCA",2015.0
134,Little Simz,A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons,Rap,7.8,September 30 2015,Jia Tolentino,Contributor,"Little Simz, the rapper from North London born Simbi Ajikawo, is starlike in many ways, including a strict one: having dropped eight mixtapes since 2013, she burns off energy at a colossal, dangerous rate. A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons is Little Simz’s first full-length album, and it marks a change from the catholic, unfurling experiments in her mixtapes. This is a tense, terse concept album: The tracks roll forward in one dark, uniform palette, each providing a different answer to a single line of questioning, as laid out by Simz in the opening track. Technically, she’s phenomenal: She revs up almost off-handedly, like she’s jumping rope, and she seamlessly shifts in and out of her singing voice like Drake. Twinning her meter almost classically, she spits: ""They told her women cannot call themselves kings/ They told her fame isn’t made for everyone."" The album that follows is, in effect, a snarling refutation. She might not be a king, but she is certainly a prince, with cosigns from Kendrick Lamar, A$AP Rocky, and J. Cole, among others. She’s got fame in her crosshairs, and likely the other way around, too, but the defining note of Trials + Persons is one of ambivalence. Simz seems engaged with the naysayers—""This the type of music that ain’t never gonna sell/ Well, you should’ve never ever told me that,"" she repeats, in two separate songs—but her real fight is within herself. At 21, she raps with a shapeshifting hardness and ragged sense of spiritual burden that brings to mind Lauryn Hill, and Kendrick too. Trials + Persons was recorded for free in the London Red Bull studio, and released on Simz' own label, Age 101, a corporate liberation that allowed her to make this 35-minute debut essentially hit one reverberating note. With the bigger producers and broader hooks a label might’ve asked for—even a single bright major chord, just once—Simz, an explosively skilled rapper, could’ve landed straight in the center. But instead, she’s keeping her talent under her own strict control, which means, by one calculus, curbing it. Instead of an album spiked with a big banging single, she offers a looping, obsessively focused experience, with her words providing structure and the pulsing orchestral instrumentation coming second. With a few exceptions, like the unprocessed drums and whining electric guitar on ""Full or Empty"", the album is a fugue state, unbroken and undifferentiated. It’s dark, but not impenetrable; Simz’s charisma keeps it lit in here, like headlights barreling around the corners of a dark room. As a writer, though, Simz is less virtuosic. The album’s language is intelligent but wholly straightforward, rarely witty and almost device-less; Simz always says exactly what she means. She’s an original in stance, then, rather than substance or specifics, turning over her central dilemma from different angles, switching between personas from song to song. In ""Gratitude"", she imagines herself stuck at home with children; in ""Tainted"" (her ""Backseat Freestyle""), she introduces her character and then jumps into a voice of a stone-cold, dead-eyed, alpha bitch. ""God Bless Mary"" is dedicated to her aggrieved neighbor (though it carries that ""Zion""-esque double reading), and it takes palpable effort for Simz to step outside herself; she can conjecture nothing about Mary’s life except the woman’s reaction to this record. In a way, the album feels radically personal: Simz is her own primary subject, and as a result is necessarily exposed. But the soul of the album is abstracted. Other people are totally figural, practically hypothetical. There are almost no specific objects, no physical places, no set decoration whatsoever. It’s just curtains pulling back on a spotlight and Simz wrestling with her ambitions like Jacob with the angel, reaching no conclusions but activating something deep.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21107-a-curious-tale-of-trials-persons/,Age 101,2015.0
135,Anderson .Paak,The Anderson .Paak EP,Pop/R&B,7.0,September 28 2015,Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,"Read the liner notes of Dr. Dre’s Compton and you’ll see the name Anderson .Paak appear six times: He produced or sang on songs ""All in a Day’s Work"", ""Issues"", ""Deep Water"", ""For the Love of Money"", ""Animals"", and ""Medicine Man"". It's the biggest look of Anderson’s career so far by a million miles, one that seemingly came from a chance encounter with the iconic producer. According to Mass Appeal, Anderson attended a studio session when his recent song, ""Suede"", caught Dre’s attention. ""He comes in, and I’m just sitting in the room, and I saw him play it over and over again,"" Anderson told the publication. ""At the third time, he was ready to work."" Until now, though, the California singer/producer had achieved marginal success: Following his 2012 debut under the name Breezy Lovejoy, Anderson’s follow-up—Venice—showed his promise as a storyteller, but the album was largely undercooked and whizzed by without much impact. Anderson has released a few singles and projects on Bandcamp, and he’s the vocal half of NxWorries with producer Knxwledge, a prolific composer who landed this great beat on Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly. The Anderson .Paak EP is the artist’s first release since Venice, and it's appearance is timely. Running just four tracks and less than 20 minutes, The Anderson .Paak EP is a quick listen, but it demonstrates Anderson’s talent and charisma. His raspy inflection evokes Bilal’s sensuous tenor and the lyrics explore mostly light fare—blowing weed, the highs of personal freedom (""Drifter II""), the captivating first moments of new love (""Make it Work""). Even when he discusses serious topics, like on the two-part ""Cheap Whiskey.70’s Reisling"", Anderson does so in the smoothest way possible. ""Wish I had a chance to write ya,"" he croons, presumably talking about an absent father figure. ""I wish I didn’t look just like ya."" Produced entirely by Los Angeles/Chicago duo Blended Babies, who have worked with the Cool Kids and Ab-Soul and credit OutKast and Eric Clapton as influences, the music is laidback, spacious funk polished in a bright, psychedelic sheen. A longer release would've been ideal, but it's a worthy precursor to something greater.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21049-the-anderson-paak-ep/,BBMG,2015.0
136,Prince,HITNRUN Phase One,"Pop/R&B,Rock",4.5,September 10 2015,Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,"Prince's hype-man instincts defy categorization every bit as much as his vocal and instrumental talents beggar description. Though he's fallen off since the 1980s—who, in his shoes, wouldn't?—it's this artist's strange and frequent urge to over-promise that helps keep everyone harping on Sign 'O' the Times as his apogee. Yet here we are again. An album title like HITNRUN Phase One promises a fair amount, not least the possibility of a concept worth serializing. And that's before the album is announced by its creators as being ""experimental"" in construction. Though after stripping away the promotional language from this streaming-only platter, exclusive to Jay Z's Tidal service (for now), one finds something far less earth-shaking: a casual, slightly-weirder-than-usual release with one very good R&B song (that's reportedly been kicking around in his vault for a while), stranded in the album's penultimate slot. To get to that very good song—at least in the manner that Prince and his young co-composer, producer, and mixer Joshua Welton intend—you'll plug through a half-hour sequence that contains a throwaway intro, a trio of putative party-starters cluttered with the confetti of modern-dancefloor production-debris, two reworked (as opposed to improved) songs from 2014's superior Art Official Age, and a tweaked version of the ""Fallinlove2nite"" standalone single that failed to make that prior album. (Ditching Zooey Deschanel's backing vocals doesn't much elevate that breezy tune's mild charm.) Among the remains, ""Hardrocklover"" would seem to be an opportunity for one of pop's most reliably sensuous guitarists to make up ground. But the song seems strangely subdued and bored with itself. While the lyrics (""Turn my guitar up so I can make this woman scream"") suggest that the inevitable appearance of guitar-heroism will be climactic, Prince's unfurling of his distorto-wail cape feels rote. The loopy-but-hard-hitting funk of ""X's Face"" is initially promising, though it too is thin on development. Elsewhere, the (mostly) instrumental ""Mr. Nelson"" riffs with a modicum of inspiration on remnants from Art Official Age standout ""Clouds"". On a first listen, you might suspect that the album's opening sequence of not-disastrous (but not-terribly-memorable) EDM-influenced jams is going to be the focus of HITNRUN Phase One. Though this, too, is part of a formula: compare Prince's almost-rap flow on ""Shut This Down"" to that of 1992's ""My Name Is Prince"", and it's easy to see that the artist has a template for approaching ascendant pop trends. There are stray, tasty touches in this opening salvo—a brief electric-bass clinic in ""Shut This Down"", the integration of saxophone, rhythm guitar, and digitally programmed curlicues in the last minute of ""Like a Mack""—but experimental this ain't. Not for the artist who wrote and recorded ""Crystal Ball"", anyway. (By point of comparison: Prince has also made newly available some truly chancy and obscure work from the late 1990s—like the extended paranoid-freakout ""The War"" and the mostly-acoustic album The Truth—on Tidal.) Disappointments and missed opportunities aside, it's still great to have an official, Prince-sung version of ""1000 X's & O's"" (an old composition once intended for Rosie Gaines). When Prince sings in an environment unmolested by contemporary cliche, he gives us more than at any other point on HITNRUN Phase One—including that iconic, multi-tracked one-man choir, in addition to lyrics that, while they might not be much on the page, snap with a seductive pull when placed in his mouth (""Every drop of sweat on your brow/ Is well-earned/ So you best believe""). Even if, this time around, you can forget the familiar discographical parlor game of comparing each new Prince record to earlier triumphs—this one isn't his best album in the last twelve months, let alone years—songs and performances like that one show why it remains unwise to count him out.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21026-hitnrun-phase-one/,NPG,2015.0
137,Method Man,The Meth Lab,Rap,4.0,September 3 2015,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"If you've been keeping up with Method Man over the past decade or so, the question isn’t whether he will make embarrassing ""Breaking Bad"" references on an album called The Meth Lab, it’s how many times will he make a reference, the likely range being ""too many"" to ""far too many."" This is how Johnny Blaze does nowadays—after kicking off 8 Diagrams with a promise to ""bring the sexy back like Timbaland and Timberlake,"" he’s followed with countless other, similarly demoralizing punchlines that are at least a year past their spoilage date. Method Man has always been expected to be Wu-Tang Clan's mainstream emissary, and his lyrics mirror their currently tangential relationship with relevancy. If that doesn’t kill your vibe, look at the tracklisting of The Meth Lab: of the 19 tracks, only three are credited solely to Method Man. One is the intro, another is the outro, and the other is fittingly called ""2 Minutes of Your Time"". This actually works out quite well for the Method Man brand—if hip-hop has completely passed him by, Method Man can always surround himself with rappers more out of step than himself. Though it doesn’t advertise as such, The Meth Lab is a throwback to Wu-Tang’s mid-2000s wilderness period where the leading figures tried to establish independent fiefdoms outside of RZA’s view—even if Hanz On, Eazy Get Rite, Mack Wilds, Chedda Bang, Dro Pesci, Kash Verazzano, and Hue Huf aren’t given the dignity of a crew name, The Meth Lab is a posse record in practice, very much in the lineage of Theodore Unit's 718, Polluted Water, or the ultimate in Wu-Tang marginalia, Ugodz-illa Presents the Hillside Scramblers. Pity these dudes if you want—Method Man is still a household name. Based on their handles alone, you can’t possibly imagine the aforementioned involved with pertinent rap music in 2015. Not that they want to anyway—beyond the likely deathless #hashtag and ""no [RAPPER OF INTEREST]"" kickers, Meth Lab's foot soldiers have a stylistic cut-off point around the most recent Method Man album, and that came out in 2006. They favor broadly-drawn street journalism and humorless punchlines, less derived from Method Man than the still-down-for-whatever Streetlife, who appears on over 1/3rd of The Meth Lab. The production complements the rapping—you likewise get Wu-Tang’s second tier (4th Disciple, Mathematics behind the boards, Killa Sin and Carlton Fisk on the mic), and the occasional ""oh that guy!"" from any number of ""bring New York back!"" waves. The biggest outside appearances come from Corey Gunz and Uncle Murda—both are technically major-label rappers, though it feels like a matter of time before Epic or one of the four imprints currently sharing Gunz fixes the glitch. Likewise, you get a beat from Ron Browz, who no longer refers to himself as Etherboy. Seven tracks are helmed by Pascal Zumaque—the first thing that pops up in a Google search of his name is his LinkedIn page. Otherwise, you know Meth’s steez—Wu-Tang’s for the children, other rappers need to pull their pants up, hip-hop peaked when you could still hear Method Man songs on the radio. He’s basically turned into Redman now—except when Redman stays making O.J. references in 2015, he’s at least staying in character as hip-hop’s favorite knucklehead uncle. Method Man just sounds like a guy who got set up with a Twitter account and has no initiative to use it, making jokes to himself while watching TV. Sift through the verses for proper names and the likes of Michael Vick, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, and Rappin’ 4-Tay emerge. Yet, here’s the one that I find most fascinating—""I’m here to analyze your shooter like I’m Kenny Smith."" Just think about that one for a second—what exactly is Method Man trying to express here? I know what he means, but it also makes no goddamn sense. This is undeniably the result of Method Man’s mind drifting while watching ""Inside the NBA"" and as far as rapper/actors clowning on the Jet, he now ranks below Shaquille O’Neal. To Meth’s credit, he hasn’t fallen the fuck off as hard as Inspectah Deck, who shows up on ""The Purple Tape"", a highlight by default because it also features Raekwon—the one guy left in Wu-Tang Clan who really hasn't fallen off at all. His F.I.L.A. record from earlier this year didn’t leave much of a mark either, but the appearances of Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky, and French Montana didn't feel like desperate grasps at Hot 97 airplay; those guys likely showed up on their own volition, an acknowledgement that Rae’s style has aged well because rapping in code about selling drugs and fly gear has never gone out of style in hip-hop and never will. All you can really do with The Meth Lab is contemplate its reason for existence— if anything, the fact that it's being released on Tommy Boy might get a chuckle out of GZA... provided you can get a chuckle out of GZA. But if you make it to the end, you find out that this is actually a prelude to Method Man’s real solo album. Which will be called Crystal Meth. So really, we’re right back where we started.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21000-the-meth-lab/,Tommy Boy,2015.0
138,Halsey,Badlands,Pop/R&B,4.9,September 2 2015,Nathan Reese,Contributor,"Halsey is the stage name of Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, a 20-year-old New Jersey native who has cultivated a dedicated following with just one EP to her name, last year's Room 93. With a shock of blue hair and vocal control beyond her years, Halsey arrived with just five songs and a buzzed-about live show. Since then she became the most tweeted-about artist at SXSW, toured with Imagine Dragons, and was the subject of a fascinating New York Times profile that explored her identity as a ""biracial, bisexual and bipolar"" artist. To boot, Halsey's debut album, Badlands' latest single, ""New Americana"", recently premiered on Apple Music's Beats 1 with an enthusiastic endorsement from Zane Lowe: ""There’s a new icon there,"" he said, possibly making it so by fiat. The momentum behind Halsey is undeniable, but Badlands mostly falls flat. At its best, the record plays like a conflagration of a half-decade's worth of alt-R&B—catchy, dark, spottily engaging. But it is weighed down by trite lyrics and stale production: The details of her story wind up far more interesting than the music itself, which is a weird place to be for a superstar-in-the-making. Badlands opens with ""Castle"", an unhurried track with a trip-hop backbone that serves as a meditation on Halsey's growing fame. ""Sick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise,"" she sings, ready to reject celebrity like an industry pro from the get-go. ""And there's an old man sitting on the throne that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean,"" she sings, taking a jab at the patriarchy; it's one of the occasional moments on Badlands where Halsey's personality emerges and the knives come out. But sonically, ""Castle"" is dull; a misguided plainchant interlude threatens to derail the track early on and the soupy production never quite congeals. Elsewhere, Halsey's choices are even clunkier. ""New Americana"" reconstitutes Lana Del Rey's Hollywood Babylon-isms and Lorde's tongue-in-cheekiness as a millennial call-to-arms: ""Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire/ Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockafellas,"" Halsey sings, piling on the Gen Y bromides. She runs down a ""big issues"" checklist, from social media fame (good? bad? maybe both!) to wealth inequality (a problem, no doubt!), and her concerns come across as plasticky and surface-level. ""New Americana"" isn't the only time Halsey evokes Del Rey. ""Drive"" hews close to the Lizzy Grant playbook, with saccharine strings and West Coast anhedonia that has Ultraviolence written all over it. The more successful tracks tend to be the ones that feel personal and specific. ""Ghost"", which also appeared on Halsey's EP, gives you a sense of what she can do when the scale is smaller. The track is a sinuous synth-pop love song whose economical runtime plays in its favor; one can almost forgive the music video for being yet another Enter the Void knockoff. ""Hurricane"", a bonus track that doubled as an early single, also has a striking specificity to its unusually bleak lyrics: ""He's got an eye for girls of eighteen/ And he turns them out like tricks,"" Halsey sings, painting a troubling picture of a traumatic youth. Reading interviews with Halsey or scrolling through her Twitter feed, you get the sense of a canny and talented performer, one who legitimately wants to connect with fans. But the public persona only comes through on Badlands in fits and starts, and there isn't a single subversive or original second on the album. ""We are the new Americana/ High on legal marijuana/ Raised on Biggie and Nirvana,"" goes the chorus on ""New Americana."" Like most of Badlands, it's calculated, defiant, and, ultimately, hollow.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20951-badlands/,Astralwerks,2015.0
139,Dr. Dre,Compton,Rap,8.8,August 11 2015,Jay Balfour,Contributor,"Dr. Dre has been holed away for a worrying amount of time. A few years ago, he released a pair of singles ostensibly linked to his since-abandoned third album, Detox, and they were dire. ""I Need a Doctor"", in particular, was awkward and clunky, and it seemed as though Dre was straining too hard to perfect his comeback. He only re-emerged from the shadows in the name of Aftermath's latter-day luminary, Kendrick Lamar, who appeared to be energizing the elder statesman. But even Dre's surprise appearance on Lamar's major label debut good kid, m.A.A.d city in 2012 felt disjointed, providing more reason to fret over the producer's impending solo return. News that Dre had scrapped Detox entirely was confirmed alongside the announcement of this new album. Years of build-up washed away in the cancellation. It must have been a unique catharsis, purging an undeliverable hype with something tangible finally in hand. Compton isn't a bait-and-switch. If anything, the album is undersold by its billing as a soundtrack, a tag that misleads how well it stands on its own originality. Dre claims the recording was inspired by the set of Straight Outta Compton, the just-released biopic about N.W.A., and for a guy who's been helplessly coddling music in private for years, Compton ended up being a bit of a rush job. And yet, that haste helps the album sound more of-the-moment and free-flowing. For the first time in more than a decade, Dre's inspiration met up with a corporate deadline, and you can see the appeal for him: an opportunity to bundle his final record with a blockbuster movie about his career's origins. In that way, he's toying with the bookends of his career, polishing the story of his come-up while coming to terms with how to step away for good. Dre has been here before, of course, years removed from a game-changer with an entire industry's eyes trained on him, wondering, ""How might he do it again?"" But he's less invested in building a comeback narrative on Compton than he was on 2001. Instead, the album finds Dre coming to terms with his career for himself, not others. If there's a surprise here, it's that Dre, a 50-year-old near-billionaire long suspected of drifting out of touch, sounds charged-up, nimble, and relevant. Dre has always relied on other rappers and producers for inspiration and his own legacy is tied up in showcasing talent, lifting and rearranging it for his own cause. On Compton he's taken the approach and doubled down, and while the album is frequently personal, it's also communal, pushing his own voice towards the margins in favor of other vocalists. The first raps we hear on the album are delivered by King Mez, a Raleigh native who, alongside Justus, the least known of the album's features, appears to have helped Dre with the bulk of his lyric writing. (Either one or both of them are credited on all but one of Dre's vocal tracks.) When Dre comes in on verse two of the sweeping opener ""Talk About It"", he brags about his unopened Eminem royalty checks and jokes about buying the state of California. It's a reminder that Dre is the richest hip-hop artist ever, but he actually seems more interested in pinning down and framing his influence than bragging about his bank account. ""Genocide"" is the earliest and clearest standout, carrying one of two showstopping Kendrick Lamar appearances, who bends and stretches his voice to the limits he encountered on To Pimp a Butterfly. The song is also the first instance on the album of Dre sounding completely unlike himself. To be sure, he's always been an obvious conduit as a rapper, unashamedly channeling the flow and cadence of his ghostwriters, but here he's adopted a delivery that spills out in bursts, his register is higher, and he's snarling; it's not the only place on Compton that Dre's rapping is both impressively light-footed and almost unrecognizable. Musically, the album is a reminder that Dre's palette and appetite for sound has always been eclectic, and rather than retread, we hear him pushing into new territory. At one moment, he's sampling an obscure modern funk band from Italy (for ""One Shot One Kill"") and the next, lifting a guitar riff from a random Turkish psychedelic burner. Throughout, session musicians polish out the edges, and Dre continues to lean on live keys and bass to fill out chunky bottom ends. Dre's quietest and most stalwart collaborator behind the boards on Compton is Focus…, son of Chic bassist Bernard Edwards and a longtime Aftermath in-house guy. (Focus… ditched the label in 2009 after spending years on end piling music into the Detox dump. He returned a few years later, working directly alongside Dre.) If Focus… is the easily overlooked workhorse—he contributes keys and bass as well as frequent co-production credits—higher-profile appearances from the likes of DJ Premier and DJ Dahi inflect Dre's music with their personalities. Primo's offering comes in the form of ""Animals"", impressively billed as the first-ever Premier and Dre collaboration. (Russian producer BMB SpaceKid programmed drums, which carry the best of the Gang Starr producer's fingerprints.) The song is also the most politically pressing on the album and nearly 30 years after ""Fuck Tha Police"" we hear desperation in place of rage. Anderson .Paak, a young multi-talent from Los Angeles who's all over Compton, finds his star turn here. (The song originally belonged to him and Premier.) Still, Dre's verse is powerful, a member of the one percent grappling with racism and the depressingly consistent anguish of being Black in America. ""Why the fuck are they after me?"" he booms, ""Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard, or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally."" The cast of musicians employed on Compton is as varied as ever, but some of the most dramatic displays come from the legends. On ""One Shot One Kill"" Snoop Dogg rekindles an agitated menace that he seemed to have lost more than a decade ago. Xzibit and Cold 187um dip into a perfect stride over the meandering ""Loose Cannons"". The Game, for the first time since The Documentary, sounds like he deserved that original Dre co-sign, owning his original identity instead of falling into chameleonic flow-stealing. ""Deep Water"" is the most dynamic and brooding cut, a moment where everyone's contributions click into place. Anderson .Paak's performance as a drowning man is upsetting and uncomfortable, while Kendrick Lamar appears to be throwing Drake subliminals—and enlisting Dre in doing so. His verse is so overspilling with genius technicality that it's hard to dwell in any one place. Part of the trouble in anticipating a new Dre album, then, has been a difficulty in framing our expectations. Hip-hop has been evolving around Dr. Dre for decades: He injected the type of ambitious orchestration into the genre that helped it modernize in the '90s, cannibalizing and assimilating everything around it. On his previous classics he showed us that new things were possible, a magic that's available only so many times in one life. Compton doesn't have the same breathtaking power, but it's excellent nonetheless, and more complicated and jarring than we could have known to hope for. The biggest and most immediately recognizable accomplishments here are basic: Dre is doing more than just fitting in or harking back, and both of those inclinations together were the real nail biters surrounding his new music anyway. Knowing that this is Dre's finale, there's a pleasant melancholy that frames Compton, and with the music in our ears, acknowledging that maybe that's for the best.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/,"Interscope,Aftermath",2015.0
140,Lianne La Havas,Blood,Pop/R&B,7.7,July 28 2015,Hannah Giorgis,Contributor,"The English songwriter Lianne La Havas may be young, but her voice marries youthful lightness with a gravitas most often ascribed to artists well beyond her 25 years. Blood, her second album, builds on the immutable grace of Is Your Love Big Enough?, her 2012 debut. Whereas Is Your Love Big Enough? looks outward for validation, Blood is dynamic and poignantly self-assured in its introspection. Blood's first single, ""Unstoppable"" is a breezy summer jam that pairs lighthearted bass and groove with a whimsical video to match. In it, La Havas twirls through an empty house singing of the unique invincibility that comes post-healing: ""Our polarity shifted around/ There was nothing else left holding us down/ But it's just gravitational/ We are unstoppable!"" Warm and affirming, the track eases listeners into a complex, layered album with La Havas' earthy notes complementing meditations on love. La Havas, whose soulful tunes place her most often in conversation with artists like Alice Smith, Laura Mvula, and Corinne Bailey Rae, handles her six-string acoustic with elegance and precision. Where she is less graceful, and at times even awkward, is the integration of more electric sounds. ""Never Get Enough"" alternates between her trademark lullaby and brash chords to almost jarring effect. The tonal shift matches the urgency of the cat-and-mouse lyrical arc, but the abrupt jumps add discordant conflict to an otherwise harmonious track sequencing. The song feels erratic, ill-suited to the pleasant lilt of La Havas' smooth voice. ""Grow"" alternates between acoustics and strong percussion, but its melodic shifts build gradually, matched by La Havas' rising vocals. Though La Havas is best known for her dreamy love songs, she shines naturally when exploring her own internal world. ""Green & Gold"" traces her coming of age through motifs from both her Jamaican and Greek backgrounds: ""I'm looking at life unfold, dreaming of the green and gold/ Just like the ancient stone, every sunrise I know/ Those eyes you gave to me, they let me see where I come from."" The nods to her mixed race heritage are childlike in their innocent inquiry, but the track still retains its maturity; its strong percussive notes deviate from her tendency toward ballads, evoking the same island influence depicted in the track's lyrics. The album's strongest ballad, the stunningly simple ""Wonderful"" showcases her at her finest: sultry, nostalgic, and sweet. The track is a gorgeous ode to love lost, its chorus enchanting: ""But wasn't it kinda wonderful?/ Wasn't it kinda wonderful, baby?"" With slow snaps punctuating La Havas' voice, ""Wonderful"" seduces as it soothes. It is the soundtrack to slow motion surprise encounters with an ex. La Havas weaves contentment with a charged reflection on past romance to tantalizing effect: ""You can trip, flick a switch negative/ Break the circuit between us/ But electricity lingers/ In our fingers."" Melodic interruption of ""Never Get Enough"" notwithstanding, Blood is an almost seamless album. Tracks flow into one another with the fluidity and serenity of rain into a freshwater pond—light, refreshing, natural. But there is substance moving here, weight in the currents. La Havas' even, powerful vocals ride syrupy strings with grace and latch onto sharper rhythms with authority. She is deft and adaptive, at once inspiring dancing and melancholy reflection: La Havas is always in motion.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20855-lianne-la-havas-blood/,Nonesuch,2015.0
141,Led Zeppelin,Presence,Rock,7.6,July 28 2015,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"In the first six years of Led Zeppelin's existence, they released seven albums' worth of music, and nearly all of it was brilliant. During that time, everything seemed to go their way: they had a bottomless well of songs built on the blues, early rock, British and American folk, psychedelia, and R&B; they had the greatest riff machine the world had ever known in Jimmy Page, and they had hard rock's quintessential drummer in John Bonham. But given their penchant for excess and the hyper-intense life they lived as the world's biggest rock band in the '70s, there was no way it could last. They were getting older and growing tired; they did too many drugs; they were too isolated. In the five-and-a-half years between the February 1975 release of Physical Graffiti and the death of drummer John Bonham that ended the band in September 1980, they released just two albums—Presence in March '76 and In Through the Out Door in August '79. The two LPs, newly reissued (along with 1982's posthumous odds-and-ends comp Coda) to round out what will almost certainly be the last large-scale catalog effort in the lifetime of the band members, were easily their weakest. But both are redeemed by the fact that they are also easily their two strangest. Presence and In Through the Out Door are opposites. The former was very much driven by Jimmy Page, who wanted badly to keep the band busy during a time of retrenchment following the serious car accident that injured Robert Plant in August 1975. The recording is ultra dry and the simple guitar/amp interface is front-and-center; just one song features an acoustic instrument, and the album has barely any keyboards. Page's strong hand led to an album that puts the focus on the playing and makes the fewest concessions to pop music. It has also developed a cult following in a way that no other single Zeppelin album has. (""Presence is just perfection,"" Jim O'Rourke told Time Out Tokyo, and given his preference for clean and crisp engineering and arrangements, his admiration makes perfect sense.) It's the Zeppelin album that was least embraced by the radio, with its lengthy songs and general aversion to hooks. But the hard and brittle sound of Presence (at points, it sounds like a Shellac album) has much to admire, not least because you can hear the contributions of each band member so clearly. There are moments of space and silence and very little standing in between the instrument and the listener. Throughout the album, bassist John Paul Jones and John Bonham are so perfectly in tune they seem like a single organism. Listen to how Jones' bass syncs with Bonham's kick drum on the tumbling stop/start masterpiece ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"", which certainly ranks with either's greatest moments, or the loping ""Hots on for Nowhere"", where the pauses serve as a third rhythm instrument. Page keeps his parts unusually lean, emphasizing percussive force over atmosphere. Distortion is used sparingly, as is reverb; though the songs contain many layers of guitars, the focus is on overlapping lines and counterpoint, even at the expense of riffs. One thing Presence most certainly is not is Plant's album; he sang these songs from a wheelchair, still recovering from a car wreck, and his voice sounds pinched and thin on the group's least inspired tunes. Indeed, the overall lack of melody on Presence shows you just how underrated Zeppelin were in that department (as does the previously unreleased bonus track ""10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod)"", a blandly pretty piano-led instrumental with a chiming acoustic guitar that's the closest Zep ever got to yacht rock). It might be their weakest album, but Presence is among the most special; none of these songs sound like they could have come from another record. It's hard to believe that In Through the Out Door was the work of the same band. By this point, Page, deep in the throes of heroin addiction, had mostly checked out, and Bonham's chronic alcoholism was reaching a terrifying end stage. Robert Plant's five-year-old son died unexpectedly in 1977 and his grief almost caused his exit from the band. Out of this turmoil came Zeppelin's most singular record, if far from their best. With Page out of commission, Plant teamed with Jones, always the group's steadying force, and they wrote colorful songs that heavily featured synthesizers. Most of the '60s and '70s veterans who made a synth-heavy album in the '80s were responding to broader trends in pop, but In Through the Out Door doesn't sound like a reaction to anything, least of all new wave. The general mood is dark and inward; Plant's words are often hard to make out, and when you do catch lyrics they are especially cryptic. But there's something restless and experimental about it too, a feeling of open-ended structures being explored. Out Door is defined by its production sheen; even the most famous guitar part on the album, Page's beautifully broken solo on ""In the Evening"", sounds like it's been run through a dozen pedals and filters. The dirge ""I'm Gonna Crawl"" is utterly shapeless, not a ballad so much as a drawn-out moan; ""South Bound Suarez"" comes at country-tonk from bizarre angles. Where Zep once had direct homages to the music of their youth, now they were creating weirdly synthetic mutant versions of them. Sometimes, as with the Sun-era Elvis trifle, ""Hot Dog"", they didn't quite work, but the Latin-inspired ""Fool in the Rain"" is a unique creation that still sounds fresh. The piano is used as a looping rhythmic instrument in the Cuban tradition—there aren't chord changes, exactly—and the feel of the whole is circular and strange. John Bonham, whose nervous system was ravaged by a daily vodka intake that would stop most people's hearts, somehow managed one last burst of genius and created his most memorable and lasting drum line (hear it in isolation and marvel at just how deeply in the pocket he could still play, the utter mastery of his feel). ""Carouselambra"", a bizarre proggy rave-up that stretches for more than 10 minutes, is impossible to compare to another song. Coda, collecting outtakes (of which Led Zeppelin did not have many), followed in 1982. The big story on this reissue is the release of tracks recorded by Page and Plant in what in the early '70s was still called Bombay. The tabla and strings certainly bring to mind the flavor of some of their experiments in global music around the time, but truthfully there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the ""Bombay Orchestra"" tracks. Beyond the new curiosities, Coda's offerings range from one of the band's best single songs (""Hey Hey, What Can I Do""), which was originally relegated to a B-side, to a fantastic III outtake (""Poor Tom""), to a couple of essential live cuts, to a skippable drum solo (""Bonzo's Montreaux"") and an exhausted rocker that truly feels like the end (""Darlene""). ""Ozone Baby"", recorded during the In Through the Out Door sessions, would have easily been that record's catchiest and most accessible song. Coda is a great listen with a skip button close at hand. Revisiting their final records, it's clear that Zeppelin didn't exactly go out on a high note. But they didn't exactly fade away, either. True to their model, they did something no other rock band of their stature has before: They took a couple of wrong turns and changed into something else rapidly before vanishing. These sets will always leave a peculiar taste in the mouth of Zeppelin fans, but they affirm they were the rock band of the '70s, the decade when rock music ruled the world. Even in their exit, they carried themselves with a majesty and strangeness that simply couldn't be replicated.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20668-presence-in-through-the-out-door-coda/,"Atlantic,Swan Song,Atlantic,Swan Song,Atlantic,Swan Song,Atlantic,Swan Song,Atlantic,Swan Song,Atlantic,Swan Song",1976.0
142,Miles Davis,Miles Davis at Newport 1955-1975: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4,Jazz,8.0,July 24 2015,Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,"Even the most optimistic fan might not have been able to foresee the long-term vitality of Miles Davis' posthumous catalog. Thanks to multi-disc box sets that have unearthed all the (thrilling) studio sessions that went into iconic fusion albums such as In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson, and On the Corner—as well as Columbia's more recent focus on unissued live performances in its Miles Davis Bootleg Series—the trumpeter-composer has remained an ever-renewable resource in the catalog. (If the branding reminds you of the label's back-pages approach to Bob Dylan, you're not wrong.) On the whole, this feels appropriate, especially when the artist under consideration created and then ditched exciting new stylistic languages with Picasso-like abandon. But a nagging question also hovers around each new deluxe set to come off the 21st Century assembly line: How long can the party last, before we get into the realm of record-company rehash? Unlike ""Bootleg Series"" sets that are more easily understood as essential, this four-disc volume strides through different decades of the Davis story. So at the outset, we get crisp, acoustic-instrument performances of tunes like ""'Round Midnight"", while at the far end of the box, we're delivered to the high-humidity atmospheres of the rock-tinged, experimental funk of Davis' 1970s lineups. The set's connecting thread is the Newport Jazz Festival—the legendary, still-running summer concert stage that Davis first stepped onto in 1955 (as a member of a brief ""All-Star Jam"" that included Thelonious Monk). Later in that decade, Davis took a hard-bop sextet (including John Coltrane and Bill Evans) to Newport, not long before it went into the studio to cut Kind of Blue. Are these early Davis appearances at Newport classic? Of course. But in the main, the music on the first disc of this box has been available for a while. As has a nearly half-hour portion of this volume's third disc (recently included on the album Bitches Brew Live). Moreover, while Davis certainly made a point of getting his various groups to the Newport festival—both its U.S. and foreign-touring iterations—there's little sense that the destination much influenced his fast-moving aesthetic development. (Unlike, say, the post-Summer of Love concerts at the Fillmore collected in the third Davis Bootleg Series release.) So instead of being wall-to-wall necessary, this Bootleg Series edition is simply three-quarters-revelatory. But what is legitimately new here is as good as anything else in the Davis-rarity series. The second disc gives us multiple, intense sets by the trumpeter's ""second great quintet,"" which traveled to Newport in both 1966 and 1967. The back-to-back sequencing of these performances shows how fast Davis' music was developing, even from within a particular lineup. (Compare the thrashing, second version of ""Gingerbread Boy"", from the 1967 date, to the more restrained 1966 iteration.) And the final disc's rarely-heard 1971 band—including Keith Jarrett on electric piano—puts its own spin on some of Davis' most familiar fusion-era tunes (including a cool-strutting ""Bitches Brew"" that leads into a majestic, slow-burning ""Funky Tonk""). The powerhouse performance in the box, however—a true drop-everything-and-call-your-friends-over-to-listen concert—is a 47-minute stretch on disc three, which puts the spotlight on a 1973 Davis band that would later go on to form the core of the ensemble on the live album Dark Magus. For some connoisseurs, Dark Magus represents Davis' point of peak-fusion—propulsive, densely textured, and grooving. But one thing that recording also has is longueurs. (It was a double-album, after all.) The 1973 gig included in this box isn't just more compact, it's nervier, too. While Pete Cosey's wild electric guitar pyrotechnics sound great on Dark Magus, his playbook of liquid licks also feels fully figured out—it's a command performance by a Davis group member who has had years to drill this particular music. By contrast, his playing on ""Turnaroundphrase"", the opening tune from this newly issued 1973 set, is more darting in nature, and alive with the sound of the guitarist figuring out a way through Davis' ferocious composition. Likewise, soprano saxophonist Dave Liebman—the only acoustic axe in this lineup—sounds as though he's fighting his way toward a state of audibility. When his keening playing joins up with Davis's own wah-wah-enhanced trumpet moans, the sound reaches flourishes of intensity that rival (and perhaps eclipse) those on Dark Magus. (The 1973 set is such a different-sounding beast, it hardly matters that its setlist is largely similar to that of the latter album.) The liner notes included with this Bootleg Series release refer to Davis' ""heath challenges"" during this period, and his reduced range on the trumpet. And yet the 1973 gig still shows Davis' bandleading and arranging skills to be working at a high level, hard living be damned. Despite the fact that those talents weren't intimately connected to the Newport Festival, particularly, they lend this box set a stable, running theme—whether Davis is leading his sextet with Coltrane, his second quintet, or else the various fusion lineups represented here. You can quibble with the inclusion of familiar material in a Bootleg Series package, but you can't argue—not yet, at least—with the unreleased depths of the Davis vault.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20816-miles-davis-at-newport-1955-1975-the-bootleg-series-vol-4/,"Columbia,Legacy",2015.0
143,Lil Wayne,FWA,Rap,5.5,July 9 2015,Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,"In retrospect, 2011 looks like the turning point of Lil Wayne’s career. He was coming off almost a year in prison, and the last album he'd offered fans before beginning his sentence was early 2010's Rebirth, a misguided-if-actually-kind-of-endearing rock album. By the time he was free and the summer of 2011 swung around, the thought of new Weezy filled fans with feelings they would never have again: anticipation and excitement. We got Carter IV. Fast-forward to 2015 and, after four years of hit-or-miss releases, The Free Weezy Album. A set billed as a ""Tidal exclusive"" doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. Tidal is already looking like the MiniDisc of streaming services and it’s only been around for a few months. The existence of FWA starts to make sense when you realize that Birdman (and by extension Cash Money) has essentially taken what would be Carter V hostage, and Wayne is currently prohibited from profiting from new music. But, as an ""artist owner"" of Tidal, no one is telling him he can’t release things for free. The Free Weezy Album, then, has a double meaning. For every memorable line or couplet (on ""He’s Dead"", he flatly admits ""rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten,"" and on ""Pull Up"", a clear Young Thug diss song, he pulls some vocal acrobatics, mimicking Thug's percussive, ratatat delivery) there are many clunkers (""she get hard dick and McDonald’s 'cause she so tired of them whoppers,"" from ""I Feel Good""). Closer ""Pick Up Your Heart"", a tedious attempt at channeling protégé Drake, features Wayne pleading ""I don't wanna do it no more"" but any kind of emotional resonance is nullified by a goofy spoken-word outro. His last words on this record are ""She said she wanted sprinkles, I said sprinkles are for winners."" Listening to FWA—which is slight by design and not any kind of statement release—I kept thinking, ""This is what listening to a new Dylan LP in the '80s must have felt like."" You knew you were in the hands of a living great, and you could convince yourself a few songs every few years were worth saving. Across FWA's 15 tracks and laborious 65 minute runtime, I can salvage ""Glory"" and maybe ""Without You"", but I can’t help but feel like the guy cherry-picking songs from Knocked Out Loaded. The effort and energy are there but the soul is missing, even when Wayne calls back to New Orleans bounce staple sample ""Trigga Man"", references TRU, or in the album’s funniest and oddly sweet moment, says ""it’s Lil Wayne, I been this shit since Lil Zane,"" which only reminds you of when he was young, hungry, and full of potential. It all raises the question: What do you want from Lil Wayne in 2015? Because let’s face it: 2007 Wayne ain’t walking through that door. Since 2011 and ""Grove St. Party"" with Lil B, how much Wayne music could be deemed essential? Has he crossed a ""Simpsons"" line where he’s been ""okay"" longer than he was great? Wayne will always wring a few memorable lines from any song, but how many of his mixtapes or singles or features have had staying power since then? Is this what we want from 2005’s best rapper alive? Are you the same person you were a decade ago?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20796-fwa/,Self-released,2015.0
144,Vince Staples,Summertime '06,Rap,8.8,June 29 2015,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Summertime '06 crams 20 songs inside an hour and when it ends Vince Staples is somehow still mid-sentence. The heavy-lidded, preternaturally calm Long Beach rapper has always seemed to have a remarkable amount on his mind, with more to say than he has room for: The last line on ""Taxi"", the final track of his first full mixtape, 2011’s Shyne Coldchain Vol. 1, ended in a similar fashion, with a freezing bucket of water—""Tried praying for forgiveness, but God told me to shut up""—before the music simply stopped. In those days, Staples seemed studiously laconic, like his friend Earl Sweatshirt, whom he is still often mentioned alongside. What’s been remarkable to watch is the way Staples has leaned forward—bigger songs, bigger statements, greater urgency–as Earl bled into the cracks in the walls of his mind. Earl doesn’t know or care if you are in the room, which is part of his appeal; Vince Staples’ eyes are boring right into you. Staples has become an increasingly powerful communicator, and on Summertime '06, his lines are sharp enough that every word digs into meat: ""I hate when you lie; I hate the truth, too."" (""Jump Off the Roof""), ""In the Planned Parenthood playing God with your mom's check/ You ain’t even been to prom yet"" (""Surf""). Like Chance the Rapper drained of hope, Staples expresses complex ideas in plain, hard sentences, ones that can be handed to you like a pamphlet: ""No matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past,"" he states simply on ""Like It Is"". His rapping is conversational, but these are the conversations you have when all optimism has been burned away. The album is split into two sides, making it technically a double album. But double albums are usually unwieldy, and Summertime '06 is breathtakingly focused, a marathon that feels like a sprint. The production bangs and clanks throughout with a septic, rusted, retooled-buggy persistence, which Staples matches. On ""Lift Me Up"", he chants the song’s title over and over again, but his voice is thin and tired, and the music heavy and slow. It’s the sound of someone working for uplift who knows in their bones just how much misery lays along the road. Summertime '06 was overseen by Dion ""No I.D."" Wilson, one-time mentor to Kanye and the force behind all of Def Jam’s best projects for years now. No I.D. seems to grasp the essence of every track he works on; music that has borne his attention almost always emerges with its worldview clarified. On Summertime '06, he turns an album produced largely by himself, DJ Dahi, and Clams Casino into one tense, seething organism, making it difficult to isolate which songs these wildly different musicians worked on. The sound is cold and brittle, full of little blurts of percussion that resemble nervous fidgets. The basslines are often played by a groaning distorted electric guitar, and songs like ""Dopeman"" have the crackling alkaline energy of a Neptunes production. There are forlorn melodies, played on keys, that sometimes sneak in behind songs like ""3230"" or ""Might Be Wrong"", and they provide the undercurrent of what all this hard-nosed realism might cost you. By now, it’s clear that Summertime is not ""fun,"" and at no point do you suspect you’ve been invited to a party. But the sound submerges you in the itch of Staples' mind. He is a devotee of realism, in its simplest definition. Keeping it real, for him, means clearly documenting everything he sees, removed from the clouds of hope or pain or pity. He marvels at the loneliness of his job as a rapper, translating his life to those who don’t live it: ""All these white folks chanting when I ask them ‘Where my niggas at?’/ Going crazy, got me going crazy, I can’t get with that/ Wonder if they know I know they won’t go where we kick it at?"" he raps on ""Lift Me Up"". The voices you hear on the album that don’t belong to Staples—the voicemail on ""Might Be Wrong"", hooks whispered by art-rapper Kilo Kish—feel like echoes or ghosts. He raps often about crimes he’s committed, but the songs don't have the cinema of street rap. His attention to detail purposefully drains the adrenaline out of the scenario and leaves a quotidian focus on the smallest facts of the situation—""Four deep, five seats, three guns,"" he observes on ""Get Paid"", and this is almost all you get. ""The sheets and crosses turned to suits and ties/ In Black America, can you survive?… No hopes and dreams, just leave us be, we leaning on the Bible,"" he laments on ""C.N.B."", an expression not so much of defiance as a simple plea for peace. Sometimes, nothing feels as real as simple weariness, or wariness. There is one true moment of tenderness on the album. ""Summertime"" has some oddly voiced guitar chords, which Clams Casino surrounds with his trademark soothing hum of synths, like a buzzing air conditioner behind yellowed drapes. Staples half-sings in an exhausted monotone. ""Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom,"" he offers. ""My teachers told us we were slaves/ My momma told me we was kings/ I don’t know who to listen to/ I guess we somewhere in between/ My feelings told me love is real/ But feelings here can get you killed."" It’s a love song, or the closest thing to that Vince Staples allows himself to make—an allowance that love might exist. There’s nothing in the song’s deadpan knock, its arrangement, or in Staples' voice, that gives away the warmth. It is just there, like the sun the song’s characters stare at to know their freedom.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20719-summertime-06/,Def Jam,2015.0
145,Thundercat,The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam,"Jazz,Pop/R&B",8.3,June 26 2015,Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,"The EP format isn't where artists tend to make big statements, with the possible asterisk-style exception of Robyn (whose Body Talk series eventually resulted in a proper, long-playing release anyway). Instead, a short-form release suggests anxious label-heads putting pressure on an artist to release something, anything, as soon as possible. But that's not at all the aura projected by this spellbinding, 16-minute, six-track sequence from Thundercat—an artist who has been in the public eye plenty this year already, thanks to prominent spots on albums by Kendrick Lamar and Kamasi Washington. While riding that wave, it's hard to imagine members of Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint saying ""We need something from you right this second,"" which leaves us with an alternative explanation: namely, that the brief duration of The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam (he's calling it a ""mini-album,"" which is the euphemism du jour for EPs) is exactly the statement the bassist-singer-composer wanted to make at this moment. The songs here are airy, and often provisional-feeling, while Thundercat's lyrics reliably invoke death, mourning, and vulnerability. The mini-album opens with an ethereal, vocal-led invocation entitled ""Hard Times"", and follows this up with a track called ""Song for the Dead"", which labors under some muffled-sounding percussion for most of its running time before stumbling into a clearer sonic field, near its conclusion. Every composition seems relentlessly aware of its own mortality. The greatest comfort on offer tends to be the nimble power of Thundercat's virtuoso technique on his main axe. That instantly recognizable, feather-touch electric bass sound of his is potent, but also gossamer-delicate in a way that reinforces the mini-album's themes of impermanence. Even when Thundercat comes up with with a monster, single-worthy groove, as on ""Them Changes""—the interlocking bass parts of which recall the supple funk Thundercat has contributed to Erykah Badu's New Amerykah series—he does not allow himself a rousing chorus, instead reverting to the wordless vowel-mewling of the mini-album's initial, more downtrodden tracks. He even fades the track into silence just as Washington starts a saxophone solo. One images that there's an extended ""Them Changes"" sitting in a folder on Thundercat's computer—though if so, it's obvious how giving listeners an epic version of this song might have thoroughly disrupted the equilibrium of a release as reflective as this one. Likewise, Herbie Hancock's keyboard cameo—which comes during ""Lone Wolf and Cub""—isn't the place for guest-star grandstanding. (Though he sounds good.) In a series of Twitter messages posted shortly after this mini-album's release, Thundercat explained that he is continuing to come to terms with the ""insanely brutal"" deaths of some close friends, while also attempting to process the larger-scale racist injustices that still occur with disheartening regularity. In the final, almost-sunny-sounding track (over some atypically bright keyboard tones), the narrator encounters a strange but comforting entity. It sounds
like Thundercat finds the figure's presence to be a welcome one—though tellingly, still has to ask ""can you tell me who you are?"" For those of us also muddling through various grim realities, it's tempting to think of this mysterious and unassuming release—which appeared with little advance notice—along similar terms. As it doesn't behave like many other recordings out in the world, you're at first blush tempted to ask what it's up to, and what it wants. But then the figure puts its arms around you, and you start to feel a bit better, even without a full explanation of what's going on. That's more than plenty of full-length records achieve.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20760-the-beyond-where-the-giants-roam/,Brainfeeder,2015.0
146,Kacey Musgraves,Pageant Material,Folk/Country,8.0,June 24 2015,Jessica Hopper,Contributor,"From its opening notes, Kacey Musgraves' Pageant Material sounds like a sigh of relief. Musgraves' voice is largely unadorned, her sound analog and organic—she is backed by a small band, sweetened by pedal steel and the occasional string section. The songs are not overworked: the choruses do not explode, they merely unfurl. Her near-perfect major-label debut, 2013's Same Trailer Different Park, positioned her as something akin to the country Kendrick Lamar—the hyperbole was that she could save country music from itself. Musgraves stands in comically stark relief to some of her CMA-hoisting peers, and her ascendance does certainly feel corrective at a time when bro-country's red cup runneth over with EDM's structural dynamics, NRA talking points, and ""rapping."" She's hailed as a new model, one seemingly reverse-engineered from Nashville's Top 40: a perpetually stoned real girl, fixating on fine '70s countrypolitan flourishes and focusing on self-acceptance. Musgraves grew up rural and working class in East Texas and firmly orients herself as someone not-that-far removed from a small town fate. Country, historically, espouses nothin'-fancy humility, but in 2015, these qualities are often illustrated by naming things—cheap beer, old trucks—that signify one's down-homeness. Mainstream country is currently a few years deep into a circa-2004 hip-hop problem, where recitation of the familiar nouns of late-stage capitalism stand as totems, or replace narrative altogether (instead of ""I slang in my white tee,"" it's ""White picket fence house on this dirt."") The exactitude of purchasing power and status is being GPS'd at all times. The lone examples of this behavior on Pageant Material are a citation of Willie Nelson (who duets on his own lovely ""Are You Sure""), the invocation of a room shared with Gram Parsons' ghost on ""Dime Store Cowgirl"", and the title track double-entendre of ""the only Crown is in my glass."" When Musgraves sings ""Just 'cause it don't cost a lot/ Don't mean it's cheap,"" on ""Dime Store Cowgirl"" it's as much a personal thesis about simple values as a repudiation of the economy around her. Musgraves' ""not""-ness is the pivot point of her artistic identity. Her songs exude a relaxed resonance because they have a lot less to prove. They feel personal, and you can locate Musgraves the artist in them (""And if I end up goin' down in flames/ Well, at least I know I did it my own way""). Mainstream country often poses an Us vs. Them chasm meant to alienate those who cannot identify with the lifestyle or values represented; for Musgraves, openness and acceptance are the paradigm. She rejects the mandates of Top 40, but maintains the hallmarks of country tradition, which makes liking her work easy and exacting critique tricky. A lot of country is about singing about what you aren't (or rather ""ain't"")—which she does often here, and most potently on the title track. One of the remarkable things about Musgraves is not how much she has deviated from country norms, but the way she expands them. The most obvious way, and the one that press and the public have latched onto, is the feminist-at-her-liberty narratives with songs (most of which are co-written by her producers, Luke Laird and Shane McAnally, who were also behind the boards on Same Trailer). While this is worth noting and celebrating, in Musgraves' case it's overstated simplification, one that continually pits her as a straw(wo)man against the easy villainy of bro country™, instead of within a canon that spans from Kitty Wells' ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"" to Loretta Lynn's ""Fist City"" to Miranda Lambert's ""Kerosene"". With Pageant Material there is less good-for-the-gander agenda than anticipated. Musgraves is confident and self-contained, but she's not measuring herself against anyone's standards but her own (the Big Machine-subtweeting ""Good 'Ol Boys Club"", and its chaser, ""Cup of Tea""), an idea that she references on most every song on the album. But under the microscope it's more than confidence, it's more than self-help self-love maxims. It's a disregard of the system; it's shrugging off the mantle of Southern Girlhood (""I'd rather lose for what I am/ Than win for what I ain't"" she sings on the title track). And unlike many in her cohort, Musgraves doesn't hoist herself up as a bad girl. Not because she isn't one, but because in her world that dichotomy doesn't exist. Instead she spends much of the record refusing the obligation to a good reputation (""Biscuits"", ""Late to the Party"", or boasting ""I'm always higher than my hair"" on ""Pageant Material""). She celebrates an authentic self expression above all—Musgraves' tendentious realness is what lends the album its quiet politics. Tussling with her persona is fun and engaging work, but it's Musgraves' songcraft that provides the whoa moments. She has the ability to shift a phrase—like ""family is family"" or ""you can take me out of the country, but you can't take the country out of me""—out of cliche and into poignancy, or hell, even into something deep. She can pin 10 of these plainspoken lines back-to-back, without ever straining the song or its narrative or appearing to do any hard work at all. Her ability to pair song to sentiment is fairly flawless. Pageant Material is a bit smoother than Same Trailer and musically there is less to grab on to. The album's maudlin center—the triptych of ""Somebody to Love"", ""Miserable"", and ""Die Fun""—gives it some gravitas. Her voice on these world-weary bits, especially the impeccably crafted ""Miserable"", give the album some of the heft it could use a little more of. It's an easy listen that clocks its 14 tracks swiftly, and can feel a little lightweight on repeated listens. The binary of ""good"" country vs. ""bad"" is one we'd be wise to retire, and is the wrong narrative to frame a songwriter of Musgraves' caliber. She remixes all that we might call corny and shopworn in other, less deft hands. She's making gold records in service to small-town DGAF burner girls who managed to half get their shit together. Which is a truly strange universe for a pop star to be working in—nestling in with the ex-Swiftie fuck-up fringe, young women imagining beyond the dead ends and expectations set before them. While much of women's work in mainstream pop is hung up on pleasure (still important!) and what disposable income nets them (ditto), Musgraves is musing in a more quotidian slog of struggle and acceptance—the work of the self. It's a strange and forgiving album, less toothsome than the ones that preceded it, but Musgraves' resistance makes this album important, even when it's imperfect.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20679-pageant-material/,Mercury Nashville,2015.0
147,Leon Bridges,Coming Home,Pop/R&B,7.0,June 24 2015,Ernest Wilkins,Contributor,"Leon Bridges, a 25-year-old Fort Worth native with a golden voice, is wholly comfortable living in the past. His Columbia debut Coming Home deftly recalls all the well-bronzed giants of soul—your Aretha, your Otis, and especially, in Bridges' case, Sam Cooke. This kind of soul revival, brought over the last decade by places like Daptone Records and artists like the Alabama Shakes, the late Amy Winehouse and others, has been almost universally embraced by (mostly older, white) music fans. (Bridges commented on this phenomenon recently in The Guardian, saying ""I have a song called ""Brown Skinned Girl"", and I ask 'Where my brown-skinned girls at?' And there's maybe one or two in the crowd. It's a little awkward sometimes."") Regardless of skin tone, fans of classic R&B will dig this album as it wholly echoes the tropes we associate with the genre: Tons of reverb, backing female singers, organ, complementary horn arrangements, doo-wops, ballads, songs of love, loss and pretty girls who can shake that thing across several municipalities. In other hands, this could be the eHow entry for ""How to make a retro soul record"". But Bridges has the talent and respect for the genre not to ham it up. Thanks to a backing band featuring Josh Block and Austin Jenkins of Austin-based utility players White Denim (whose 2013 album Corsicana Lemonade deserves your attention), the tunes sound equally timeless and consistent. Bridges can sing magnificently, and has the obvious Sunday choir-honed chops. There is an appealing gentleness to his voice, and to his record, that sets him somewhat apart. There are some annoyances, however. Nostalgia is one thing, but true artists find a way to interject themselves into their music even if they're paying homage to a classic genre (Bridges would do well to revisit the work of labelmate Raphael Saadiq, who did classic soul with his own unique spin). While he obviously has good intentions, at times, Bridges can't help but come off as an imitator. There's rarely any urgency in this album, even when he's promising a lost love that he would literally swim the Mississippi River to get her back (""Better Man""). Therein lies the main issue with Coming Home. Unlike the legends who inspired Bridges by squeezing every last drop of feeling out of their voices—Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, or even gospel heavyweights like the late Rev. James Cleveland—the emotion on the album never fully heats up past ""Yeah, I'm pretty keen about my record being sold in this Starbucks, thanks for asking!"" Speaking of Cooke, he said it best: ""As a singer grows older, his conception grows a little deeper, because he lives life and he understands what he is trying to say a little more."" Bridges is just starting out and there are enough signs on Coming Home that he's only going to get better. Songs like ""Lisa Sawyer"" (a deeply specific ballad dedicated to his mother), display why he's already getting looks from the likes of Jools Holland and why his recent Chicago gig at the legendary Green Mill had potential ticket-buyers in a frenzy once the event sold out. On the title track, Bridges sets out on his own path, using the spirits—the ones celebrated on Sunday morning at church, as well as the ones consumed on Saturday night in the juke joints—as his guide. While it's a little early in that journey, he has enough sheer talent that you want to stick around to see it all finally come together.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20725-coming-home/,Columbia,2015.0
148,The Rolling Stones,Sticky Fingers,Rock,10.0,June 19 2015,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album Sticky Fingers, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's Beggars Banquet and the following year's Let It Bleed on through this album and 1972's Exile on Main St., the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and Sticky Fingers could reasonably be called their peak. Beggars and Let It Bleed might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; Exile's tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. Sticky Fingers is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol. ""Brown Sugar"" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, ""all the nasty subjects in one go""). But words were secondary for the band at this point—Sticky Fingers is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R&B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of ""Wild Horses"" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of ""Dead Flowers"" to a Mississippi Fred McDowell cover (""You Gotta Move"") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R&B of ""I Got the Blues"" to the crunchy boogie of ""Bitch"" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"", Sticky Fingers is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like English boys doing their version of the blues, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations. By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, Sticky Fingers was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to Duane Allman's playing from this period. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (Exile mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor. When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on Sticky Fingers, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on ""Dead Flowers"" is obviously played for laughs, but ""You Gotta Move"" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. ""I Got the Blues"" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. ""Sister Morphine"" and ""Moonlight Mile"" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty. With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like Zeppelin, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of Exile on Main St. pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of ""Brown Sugar"" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year. To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about more: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. The Stones entered the '70s still young and beautiful, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into disco and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on ""Miami Vice"" and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on Sticky Fingers and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20483-sticky-fingers/,"Rolling Stones,Rolling Stones",1971.0
149,Florence and the Machine,"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful",Pop/R&B,7.6,June 2 2015,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"Florence Welch has built her career on the premise that she feels things more painfully and powerfully than anybody else. Accordingly, her band's third studio album How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful is one long Ophelia mad scene, a breakup record from the point of view of someone who is absolutely convinced that her breakup is the most devastating thing that has ever happened to anyone. She makes a pretty good case for that, to be fair. ""What was it that I said?/ I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed,"" she cries in ""Ship to Wreck"", which goes from sleeping pills to great white sharks in its first two lines. Welch has quoted producer Markus Dravs as telling her that she's ""not allowed to write any more songs about water,"" although she appears to have dodged that dictum at every opportunity. These aren't just songs about heartbreak; they're songs about total and utter eclipses of the heart. ""Delilah"", for instance, concerns the epic psychic carnage involved in waiting for a phone call from a boyfriend, and yes, that's Delilah as in Samson. (Several songs later, she's ""thrashing on the line,"" this time as a fish.) Over the course of the album, she also invokes (or casts herself as) Persephone, Lot's wife, the Virgin Mary, Daphne, Jonah, and St. Jude—both the saint and the European storm, alluded to in both senses in two different songs. Over ""Queen of Peace""'s stomps and choir and horns, she imagines herself ""dissolving like the setting sun/ Like a boat into oblivion/' CAUSE YOU'RE DRIVING ME AWAAAAAAY!"" (See? Aquatic lyrics again.) It takes an alarming seriousness of purpose to pull this stuff off—the campy playfulness of Florence and the Machine's 2009 debut single ""Kiss With a Fist"" wouldn't do. The obvious presence lurking near Welch's current songwriting is Adele, whose ""Rolling in the Deep"" she has to wish she'd thought of first, but the other source of inspiration floating nearby is PJ Harvey, specifically the PJ Harvey of To Bring You My Love. (As with Harvey, there's a lot of gender-flipping in Welch's lyrics: ""Mother"" would be very obviously a gospel song if it were called ""Father"".) Welch's voice trembles and groans until she hauls herself up to the parts of her songs that she can belt out with desperate, bleating vibrato. And the arrangements on How Big are this big: lush and ornate, tinkering with their details every few seconds, cresting and crashing and cresting and cresting some more. The title track's orchestral coda is worthy of Trevor Horn's wildest fantasies. What really binds How Big together, though, is Welch's exceptional sense for melody. No matter how tormented these songs get, they let her show off with grand, arching vocal lines, leaping deftly across her registers. (There are going to be a lot of disappointed karaoke singers signing up for ""What Kind of Man"" or ""Delilah"", then discovering that their range is nowhere near Welch's.) This is a huge, sturdy record, built for arenas—the band is among the headliners at this year's Bonnaroo, Roskilde, Lollapalooza and Governors Ball—and it's richly and carefully enough constructed to endure the extensive exposure Welch's heartache is going to get over the course of this summer.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20605-how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful/,Island,2015.0
150,Snoop Dogg,Bush,Rap,6.5,May 13 2015,Julian Kimble,Contributor,"Over the course of two decades, Snoop Dogg’s adaptability has allowed him to move from the G-funk of ""Gin and Juice"" to the sweaty club anthems of ""Down 4 My N’s"" to the reggae of Snoop Lion. His voice sounds good over all kinds of production, but some of his best late-period work has come when collaborating with the Neptunes. The success of ""Beautiful"" established Snoop, the Neptunes, and Charlie Wilson as a powerful team, and led to the Virginia producers contributing several tracks (including the chart-topping ""Drop It Like It’s Hot"") to his 2004 album, R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece. With Bush, fans who might have yearned for a Snoop album produced entirely by the Neptunes at the time (almost) get their wish: Pharrell Williams handles the boards here, with occasional assistance from his former production partner Chad Hugo. Bush was conceived as a tribute to the funk and R&B of the 1970s, and the familiar wail of Stevie Wonder’s harmonica on the stand-out opener, ""California Roll"", establishes the mood. Over an instrumental as smooth as a ride down Rodeo Drive on an 85-degree day, Snoop's croon is convincing enough to sell lines like “So if you wanna go to Melrose/ Let’s hit Adidas, girl, we got our own shell toes."" Pharrell positions L.A. as the nucleus of luxury and vice (""Baby you can be a movie star/ Get yourself a medical card, yeah/ ‘Cause that’s how California rolls"") on the sticky hook, and Wonder accents P’s trademark falsetto with background vocals. Both Snoop and Pharrell are products of the '70s, so it makes sense that they'd embrace the ambiance of the music they grew up listening to, and that they'd be pretty good at it. The mood holds from the bubbly disco of ""R U A Freak"" to the Nile Rodgers-inspired guitar work on ""Awake"", a song that brings to mind the second wind you get during a party’s final 20 minutes. On ""Peaches N Cream"", Snoop, Pharrell, and Wilson combine once again for an infectious retro-funk fusion. From start to finish, Bush is a feel-good record. Snoop has said that he tapped Pharrell for creative guidance because he wanted a cohesive sound for the album. At just 41 minutes long, Bush is indeed an easy listen, but the songs also bleed together. ""I Knew That"", for example, opens with the same motif as the one used on the superior ""Peaches N Cream"". And although the album features just 10 songs, it feels like there are only about six. Bush is designed to function as an old funk record that you can let run for an entire party’s duration, but its uniformity might make it less appealing over the long haul. Still, it makes sense for Snoop to be making this type of music at this stage of his career, as he approaches his mid-forties and rap recedes into his past. The music puts past images of him grooving to Bootsy Collins while stoned in Baby Boy or dancing to Funkadelic in The Wash in perspective—funk has long been his lifeblood. So while Bush is strong enough musically, you can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if this crew had followed R&G with a full-length a decade ago, when everyone involved was still in his prime.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20435-bush/,Columbia,2015.0
151,Mumford & Sons,Wilder Mind,Rock,2.0,May 7 2015,Maud Deitch,Contributor,"Mumford & Sons didn't have to be awful. A British neo-folk band, liberally applying the trappings of Americana, they made big songs well-suited to big stages, and they made them about as well as possible. But awful they were, nonetheless, a band so determined to be huge that they willed themselves into anonymity. Their latest effort, Wilder Mind, is a ""rock"" record in the least interesting sense of that word—a pastiche of the genre’s most common elements, from big percussion, electric guitars, and warm synths, to poignant but ultimately surface-level lyrics. It has all the elements of radio-friendly 2015 American rock'n'roll, with very timely nods to Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen, but what it’s lacking in is any kind of originality, or message—and most importantly, it’s lacking in banjo, the only thing that ever set the band apart from the bro-rock horde in the first place. With the production help of James Ford (member of Simian Mobile Disco, and producer for Arctic Monkeys) and Aaron Dessner of the National, the band has successfully created perhaps the most adequate commercial rock album of 2015. It’s fine. But fine is nowhere near good, and, when the music is this empty, it might actually be worse than bad. Love songs are low-hanging fruit, and on Wilder Mind, Mumford picks from the lowest branches. The first words uttered on the album's opening track, ""Tompkins Square Park"", are ""Oh, babe,"" and like a boyfriend offering a generic apology, the song that follows sounds like it could be applied to any romantic situation at any time. There’s so little actual heart present in the songs, so little heartbreak, that it’s hard to imagine they were written from any kind of real place. This is music without any real center, designed only with montages and ""Grey’s Anatomy"" climaxes in mind. What the album sounds like, above all else, is easy money. These are songs that reflect emotion but generate none. They don't have feelings, they have #thefeels. The ‘I’ in these songs feels heartbreak but not too much; longing, but not too much; joy, but again, not too much. The influence of Dessner’s production is obvious in the richness of the arrangements, but where the National’s enormous sound is countered by obtuse and specific lyrics, Mumford matches a big, general sound with big, general statements of longing, and it falls flat. Petty and Springsteen are storytellers, bringing tangible and unique perspective to their personal narratives and those of their subjects. Mumford is telling the tale of the everyman, in that their narrative could be literally about every single man. Songs like ""Believe"" are so lumbering that they are almost vulgar. ""I don’t even know if I believe/ Everything you’re trying to say to me,"" Mumford sings in his best Chris Martin-soft-voice, before laddering up to a loud, crunchy apex of sound that explodes into a plea for some kind of redemption. The conflict on Wilder Mind is pedestrian—the confusion of someone with nothing real to lose. On ""Cold Arms"", the only song on the record that provides a vague respite from the formula, pairing Mumford’s plaintive vocals with a single electric guitar, he sings of a relationship where he and his partner are simultaneously ""bloodshot and beat/ and never so alive."" There’s no evidence of life on the track itself, which follows every imaginable rule so closely that all traces of life are erased. Many of the songs on the album reference specific locations in New York City, from the aforementioned opener to the galloping ""Ditmas"", which names the small Brooklyn neighborhood, home to many members of the National, where the album's demos were recorded. But they make no reference to any location outside of their titles, and listened to sequentially, it seems as if any of these songs could switch titles with the next one with no discernible effect. They are 12 variations on vaguely Don Henley-inspired arena schlock, and in this transition, they've found a new bottom. Mumford & Sons' only hope to stand out was lost in favor of a cheap imitation, and not even a banjo can save them now.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20421-wilder-mind/,"Island,Glassnote",2015.0
152,My Morning Jacket,The Waterfall,Rock,7.9,April 30 2015,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"""I'm getting so tired of trying to always be nice,"" Jim James laments on ""Big Decisions"", the first single from My Morning Jacket's seventh LP The Waterfall. It's a surprising line from James, a guy responsible for a nearly weeklong music festival in Mexico named One Big Holiday. If there was a mean bone in his body, we haven't seen it before—My Morning Jacket lyrics are mostly praise and posi-vibes, feeling wonderful about a wonderful higher power for giving wonderful men the most wonderful voices. On ""Big Decisions"", James pushes back on the weight of a lopsided relationship, and the mundane, everyday struggle is charged with everything that has made My Morning Jacket one of the most likeable major American rock bands of the 21st century—reverberating Flying V guitars, James’ expansive rebel yell, explosive harmonies and reverb capable of canvassing the entirety of Manchester, Tenn. and beyond. Even if James is reasserting himself in an atypically selfish way, it sounds like a triumph big enough for everyone to share. Since My Morning Jacket abandoned the grain silo on their 2005 masterwork, their albums have followed a similar format: reverb or no reverb, James’ saintly voice can redeem anything, so no song idea was too strange as long as it could still work at Bonnaroo. On that level, The Waterfall does little you haven’t already heard from My Morning Jacket; they just regain the quality control that abandoned them on Evil Urges and ditch the damage control that pervaded Circuital. ""Believe (Nobody Knows)"" feels precision-engineered for the express purpose of opening My Morning Jacket's live show for the next two years: a big, windmilled chord anticipates every low-register repetition of the title in the prechorus, preparing for when James lets the final ""BELIIIIIIIIIEVE"" rip an octave higher. And that’s where the Klieg lights inevitably hit, as does the same recognizable liftoff from ""Wordless Chorus"" and ""Mahgeetah"", a feeling that the possibilities of life itself are limitless, not just the range of My Morning Jacket. You can’t fake something like ""Believe (Nobody Knows)"" if you haven’t played in front of tens of thousands of festival goers. Then again, few found fault with the first ten minutes of Evil Urges and Circuital; the measure of a My Morning Jacket album is their success at doing what’s not expected of them. Compared to ""Highly Suspicious"" or ""Holdin’ on to Black Metal"", the risks here are more manageable, the results far more successful: there’s ""Compound Fracture"", which tails off into a coda of keyboard flutter and falsetto after flaunting Chvrches electronic stomp and Some Girls strut. ""Get the Point"" delivers James’ most biting lyrics to date within a McCartney-esque acoustic ditty (""I'm trying to tell you plainly how I'm feeling day to day/ And I'm so sorry now that you ain't feeling the same way""). The electronic cut-and-paste of ""Spring (Among the Living)"" is a sleek, modernist iPad compared to ""Cobra""’s bulky, retro ENIAC, while Eastern modes poking through ""Like a River"" and ""Tropics (Erase Traces)"" scent the chillout tent with lavender incense rather than the usual weed smoke. It reaffirms that MMJ are one of the most exciting American rock bands going when they’re at their most generous, curious and restless, as they are here. But ""Big Decisions"" puts the focus squarely on a new place for an MMJ record: the lyrics. The song, and the album as a whole, gives Jim James The Person center stage for what feels like the first time, instead of just The Voice of Jim James. As on record, James has been open with the big picture while skimping on the details—after 15 or so years of giving his all on stage, he’s left just as much off it, and here he is at 37, nearly crippled by workplace injuries, spent from partying and wondering aloud in Rolling Stone, ""what have I done wrong in every relationship I've been in until now?"" There are legitimate personal stakes here and The Waterfall allows for James to express some uncharacteristic negativity without dwelling on it. For a record of spiritual and romantic reckoning, it’s remarkably level-headed and pragmatic. James sweetly coos over Chi-Lites psych-soul, ""It’s a thin line/ Between love and wasting my time"", clearly assessing a broken situation to which he mends on ""Get the Point"": ""Daydreaming of leaving/ I only had to do it."" He wishes his ex the best of luck and then immediately celebrates the exhilarating, frightening rush of single living on ""Spring (Among the Living)""—during each rambling guitar solo, you can picture James right-swiping to his heart’s content. For many, Jim James is basically synonymous with My Morning Jacket, so it’s justifiable to find parallels in the rejuvenation of each—My Morning Jacket has another album on the way some time next year. It’s welcome news for the band's fans, but maybe a bit disappointing considering how a predetermined release schedule usually results in two very good albums in place of one great one, and The Waterfall gets close to greatness. With a little troubleshooting, it might have matched At Dawn's cohesion or Z's dazzling diversity: The misty-eyed reflection of ""Only Memories Remain"" cycles back to a breakup narrative on Side B that otherwise feels like it was put on shuffle, and The Waterfall stalls the most during the usually incendiary guitar workouts. But this is Jim James accepting where he and My Morning Jacket are at the moment: a bit older, a bit broken, more skeptical but very much among the living.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20396-the-waterfall/,"Capitol,ATO",2015.0
153,Alabama Shakes,Sound & Color,Rock,8.1,April 23 2015,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"Two years ago, Alabama Shakes performed at the White House as the Obamas sat in the front row, just a few feet away. The Athens, Ala. band were part of a ""Memphis Soul"" revue celebrating that city’s groundbreaking '60s sounds, which famously featured black and white musicians working together to make lasting hits like ""Hold On, I'm Comin'"" in the thick of the civil rights era. The visual symbolism of the event was powerful, a historically rich triumph of the unity that soul music has often portended: As the nation’s first black president looked on, multiracial Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard led her band of white instrumentalists—along with Memphis greats Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper—on the classic 1967 blues track ""Born Under a Bad Sign"". Barack and Michelle nodded their heads in respectful rhythm. Malia seemed mildly amused. Sasha, meanwhile, was bored. Like, remarkably bored. Her flat stare was the type usually reserved for dentist waiting rooms or Target customer service lineups. Her obligatory golf clap at the end of the song was wan to the point of noiselessness. Howard, for her part, could probably see where the youngest Obama was coming from. During the performance, the singer paced impatiently, seemingly humbled by the pageantry and also perhaps feeling a little constricted by the antiquity of it all. It wasn’t that Howard and her band didn’t know their blues; the working-class quartet came from a small town in the mythic South and cut their teeth on hours-long sets of covers. And when the frontwoman belted, ""Hard luck and trouble been my only friend/ I been on my own ever since I was 10,"" the lines held pointed meaning for Howard since she lost her older sister—and only sibling—to cancer when she was around that age. But for all their preternatural grit, sweat, and passion (along with every other age-old signifier of rock'n'roll authenticity known to man), Alabama Shakes were never quite comfortable with the retro-soul box many placed them into upon their arrival in 2012. To be fair, their debut, Boys & Girls, certainly deserved the tag, its vintage moves elevated mostly by Howard’s gale-force delivery, an instrument that could have blown Otis Redding back. The band’s effortless charm, instant familiarity, and Great Recession recovery anthem ""Hold On"" made them easy to root for, and the album went onto sell more than 700,000 copies. It felt as if they could be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at any moment. And yet, the idea taking on the mantle of '60s soul was never part of the plan for Alabama Shakes. In interviews, they casually distanced themselves from the pure revivalists of Daptone Records while repping for theatrical sensationalists like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and My Chemical Romance; their origin story had Howard noticing bassist Zac Cockrell because he was wearing an At the Drive-In shirt; when the band hit ""Saturday Night Live"" recently, Howard wore earrings emblazoned with Prince’s face. ""We just don’t wanna own the classic R&B title and let people down,"" guitarist Heath Fogg diplomatically stated around the release of Boys & Girls, ""because when we go electronic on the next record it might break some hearts."" Sound & Color is not an electronic record. But it is strange and mystical and unexpected—more Houses of the Holy than ""Holy Cow"". It’s got past lives and future people, traces of Curtis Mayfield, Erykah Badu, MC5, the Strokes. There’s a song called ""Shoegaze"" that could find a second home on the Rolling Stones’ Tattoo You. Bon Iver collaborator Rob Moose provides eerie string arrangements that slowly encroach on songs like ivy climbing up a fence while the band and co-producer Blake Mills tweak tones and rhythms to make guitars and drums and bass and keyboards sound genuinely exciting—fresh, even—in 2015. This is stadium soul with one eye peeking toward another galaxy while hands and feet and throats desperately try to suss out life here on Earth. Of course, Howard is at the center of it all. Over the course of the last three years, she’s managed to take complete control over her unbridled voice without losing a smidge of spontaneity. She’s no longer just building toward an ecstatic climax (though there are several of those here), but rather exploring the upper reaches of her register, cajoling instead of hollering, taking on operatic cadences. The singer, who took part in both raucous Baptist services as well as a cappella hymns in the Church of Christ growing up, layers her vocals on almost every track, offering harmonies and ghosts that can’t help but follow her around; on one bipolar love song, what sounds like ghoulish laughter echoes behind Howard as she pours her being into the words ""gimme all your love!"" Is she reveling in her desires? Sending up her larger-than-life voice? Smiling into the void of unrequited love? Yes, yes, and yes. As a lyricist, Howard excels at spinning down-home profundity that make her sound her age, 26, and years beyond. Along with her tales of haunted love, cautious optimism, and impassioned pacifism come more impressionistic songs that mean to find connections between epochs and space. She and her band travel through the blues back to a bad sign—or is it a good one?—on ""Gemini"", a six-and-a-half-minute excursion into zero-gravity funk. Whereas Alabama Shakes once seemed destined to relive the history of others, they invent their own genesis here, as weeds grow near the Tennessee River and eyes reveal dreams that eventually must wake up. And just as the song comes to a close, it keeps going for a little while longer.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20420-sound-color/,ATO,2015.0
154,"Tyler, the Creator",Cherry Bomb,Rap,6.7,April 17 2015,Matthew Ramirez,Contributor,"In a recent appearance on ""Tavis Smiley"", Smiley asked the now-24-year-old Tyler, the Creator to describe himself. He replied with a candid, perhaps-practiced monologue: ""I’m very bright. I’m smart. I’m annoying and obnoxious. I’m very creative and borderline genius, and I think other people are starting to see that, too."" Cherry Bomb, Tyler’s fourth long-player and third official album, complements his self-professed characteristics to a T, in ways both good and bad. His greatest strength has always been world-building, using a synth-heavy blitz of candy-colored jazz chords taken straight (sometimes blatantly so) from the Pharrell handbook. Cherry Bomb isn’t exactly a hard left turn from this lane, but it is a quick swerve. He’s still occasionally obnoxious and shockingly adolescent for someone almost a quarter-century old (on ""Smuckers"" he defiantly raps, ""Fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat"" with the gusto of Ian MacKaye declaring his devotion to straight edge). His idea of a joke is making the lead single to his rap album a Stevie Wonder-inspired bop about an underage relationship. What makes the joke ""land,"" of course, is that the song is really good, a warm-sounding piece of pop music complete with an appearance from the ineffable Charlie Wilson. It’s a smart, annoying, obnoxious, creative, and borderline genius tactic from someone still working on reaching his final form. The best thing Cherry Bomb has going for it is relative brevity. Goblin and Wolf were notoriously long, which felt like a betrayal of one of Tyler’s biggest strengths—shotgun blasts of creativity and anguish as opposed to woozy, multi-part dirges that bordered on self-parody. Cherry Bomb still features three songs that are longer than six minutes, but the songs transform within themselves, like the jazz Tyler admires, so that they almost feel like three songs in one. There's still nothing ""minimalist"" about what Tyler does; this tweet just about sums up his approach to this album. Opener ""Deathcamp"" was allegedly inspired by the Stooges, and it sounds like what would happen if you put Tyler's idea of the Stooges on top of Glassjaw on top of Trash Talk, and, it should go without saying, on top a vintage N.E.R.D. production. Your mileage may vary, but I find it thrilling—the influence of rock music, while always present in Tyler’s music, is overwhelming here, which creates a Rebirth-ian wrinkle to an album that, to its strength and detriment, mostly recycles three or four similar ideas. ""Pilot"" and the title track to me recall none other than Big Black—drum machine-led walls of sound that break down and start up again as Tyler struggles to be heard over the noise. He is friends with Toro Y Moi’s Chaz Bundick (who makes an anonymous appearance on filler track ""Run""), and ""Find Your Wings"" is Tyler’s gentlest song to date, an interlude that’s part quiet storm, part Toro, and completely without pretense or sarcasm. Kanye and Wayne have verses on ""Smuckers"", the album’s best song. All three artists are auteurs in their own right, and with Tyler’s verses bookending and sandwiching the track and a beat switch thrown in the middle, it’s as if he’s playing hot potato with rap’s most singular voices and inserting himself in their world, a vandal placing his imprimatur on a piece in a gallery. The thrilling part is how at home Kanye and Wayne sound having fun in this playground (Kanye’s ""Richer than white people with black kids/ Scarier than black people with ideas"" is an instant classic, while Wayne slides into a comfortable vintage flow). There will be a lot of talk about how unfocused or chaotic this album is, but I’ve always taken that as par for the course with any Tyler music. Tyler is still gonna do Tyler things, and it’s refreshing when an artist creates exactly the kind of art they want to create. A quick glance at the announced five alternate covers to the album was revealing—there’s a real aesthetic consistency to them. I’m reminded of the work of Marilyn Minter, an artist with a similar panache for creating intentionally ugly and tacky art, with the knowing observation, ""Yes, this is ugly, but I can’t stop looking at it."" That may be old hat at this point, but the idea is still such a seductive one: I know it's a mess, I put a lot of work into creating this mess, and it's your problem if you can't handle it. A funhouse mirror doesn’t make sense without knowledge of how a regular mirror works. Tyler, the Creator only creates as the sum of his exhaustive, trying, kaleidoscope self—and I keep looking at him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20493-cherry-bomb/,Odd Future,2015.0
155,Laura Marling,Short Movie,Folk/Country,7.4,March 27 2015,Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,"Laura Marling is a particularly standoffish singer/songwriter, reserved in interviews and tauntingly prickly in song; a typical line, from A Creature I Don’t Know standout ""Sophia"", is ""I never did say whatever it was you did that day."" As she’s grown, she’s moved farther in this direction, away from the plain-spoken vulnerability of Alas, I Cannot Swim into vocals that curl words into secretive murmurs, and lyrics that tiptoe up to confessions then stop just short. Mythology and formal allusions swirl around even her candid moments, assuring that any autobiography is lost in the fog. So it’s a mild shock to hear Marling sing ""We shared an apartment on the Upper West Side"" toward the beginning of her fifth record Short Movie. The lyric is rooted to a specific place, a specific happening in her life. It’s even a precise moment—2012’s post-Hurricane Sandy blackout, which left most of lower Manhattan without power and ""dark, as if no one lives there,"" as she says on ""False Hope"". In interviews, Marling acknowledges Short Movie is more unguarded, though characteristically only to a point: ""The arm’s distance was getting closer with this record for sure, but then I stopped,"" she told The Guardian, declining to elaborate. In part, the new sense of openness comes from the sound. Short Movie is her first album written on electric guitar—specifically, her father’s old Gibson 335. It’s not a drastic change, as Marling’s uptempo tracks have always had muscle, but it’s palpable nevertheless. Marling toured Once I Was an Eagle with longtime cellist Ruth de Turberville (who contributes lovely arrangements on Short Movie) but little else in the way of a band or instrumentation, and on Short Movie, she clutches every guitar fill like it’s a long-lost piece of her identity, luxuriating in space and writing bigger and hazier songs to match. The arrangement on ""Warrior"", for instance, is stranded atop a canyon of echo and given an arrangement so vast and dusty that Marling almost gets away with the America rip (yes, that one). ""Warrior"" is hauntingly serious, but elsewhere you can hear here loosening up: ""Strange,"" a near-spoken disembowelment of a hapless cheating man, wouldn’t work without the cruelest hitch of a laugh in Marling’s voice as she informs him, ""I don’t love you… I’m pretty sure that you know."" It’s easily the standout: every syllable delivered like acid, and lyrics that continually walk up to the line and cross it—right up to ""No, I do not believe we were born equally."" Short Movie has been called Marling’s ""quarterlife crisis"" album, but the crises she's grappling here are the same ones she's confronted her entire career: love as a threat to autonomy, suitors as perpetual disappointments, wariness of intimacy but also of the alternatives. Album opener ""Warrior"" is a mythological conceit typical of Marling—men as warriors, women as the steeds they misuse. Marling is the sort of artist to deliver ""I feel your love"" like it’s synonymous with fear, or choking gas; ""Walk Alone"" is the sound of a woman who’s sat with herself long enough to realize, horrified, that what she hears inside is a lonely-morning dirge. This turns out to be Short Movie’s main, minor downfall: Most of these themes were explored, in more eviscerating detail, in Once I Was an Eagle, and the album meanders in the second half. Without an overarching conceit like Once I Was an Eagle, Short Movie comes off sounding like a transition record, a short movie in the sense that it’s a prelude to something bigger. But Marling’s career is remarkable in part because album after album she not only delivers on those bigger things, but delivers them in her idiosyncratic voice. She’s spent her entire career dodging comparisons, but by now she has earned the right to be compared only to herself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20377-short-movie/,"Ribbon Music,Virgin EMI",2015.0
156,Kendrick Lamar,To Pimp a Butterfly,Rap,9.3,March 19 2015,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"Kendrick Lamar’s major-label albums play out like Spike Lee films in miniature. In both artists’ worlds, the stakes are unbearably high, the characters’ motives are unclear, and morality is knotty, but there is a central force you can feel steering every moment. The ""Good and Bad Hair"" musical routine from Lee’s 1988 feature School Daze depicted black women grappling with colorism and exclusionary standards of American beauty. Mookie’s climactic window smash in 1989’s Do the Right Thing plunged its characters into fiery bedlam, quietly prophesying the coming L.A. riots in the process. In these moments, you could feel the director speaking to you directly through his characters and their trajectories. Lamar’s records, while crowded with conflicting ideas and arguing voices, have a similar sense of a guiding hand at work. Lamar’s new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, doesn’t explicitly bill itself as a movie like good kid, m.A.A.d city did, but the network of interlocking dramas explored here feels filmic nonetheless, and a variety of characters appear across the album’s expanse. The opener, ""Wesley’s Theory"", turns the downfall of action-star-turned-convicted-tax-dodger Wesley Snipes into a kind of Faustian parable. Snoop drops by on ""Institutionalized""; Dre himself phones in on ""Wesley"". The mood is wry, theatrical, chaotic, ironic, and mournful, often all at once: On ""For Free? (Interlude)"" an impatient woman ticks off a laundry list of material demands before Kendrick snaps back that ""This dick ain’t free!"" and thunders through a history of black oppression, spoken-word style, as if to say, ""This money you crave, it’s blood money."" The album is dotted with surreal grace notes, like a parable: God appears in the guise of a homeless man in ""How Much a Dollar Cost"", and closer ""Mortal Man"" ends on a lengthy, unnerving fever-dream interview with the ghost of 2Pac. The music, meanwhile, follows a long line of genre-busting freakouts (The Roots’ Phrenology, Common’s Electric Circus, Q-Tip’s Kamaal the Abstract, André 3000’s The Love Below) in kicking at the confines of rap music presentation. There’s half a jazz band present at all times; pianist Robert Glasper, producer/sax player Terrace Martin and bass wizard Thundercat give Butterfly a loose, fluid undertow every bit as tempestuous and unpredictable as the army of flows at Kendrick’s disposal. The rapper’s branching out, too, exploding into spastic slam poetry on ""For Free?"", switching from shouty gymnastics to drunken sobs on ""u"" and even effecting the lilt of a caring mother on ""You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)"". It turns out Kendrick’s new direction was every direction at once. Despite all this, he’s still toying with a narrative on the sly: Just beneath the surface lies a messianic yarn about avoiding the wiles of a sultry girl named Lucy who’s secretly a physical manifestation of the devil. Kendrick refuses to dole out blame without accepting any, however, and on the chaotic free jazz excursion ""u"" he turns a mirror on himself, screaming ""Loving you is complicated!"" and suggesting his fame hasn’t helped his loved ones back home. Kendrick’s criticisms, as they did on good kid, come with powerful, self-imposed challenges. As Bilal quips on the chorus to ""Institutionalized"": ""Shit don’t change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga."" Kendrick’s principle of personal responsibility has treaded dangerously close to respectability politics lately, especially after a prickly remark about the Mike Brown shooting in a recent Billboard interview that seemed to pin the death on the victim, but To Pimp a Butterfly avoids that trap. (Mostly.) ""Complexion (A Zulu Love)"" is a tender note of appreciation for women of all skin tones with help from North Carolina rapper Rapsody (whose slickly referential guest verse contains a nod to ""Good and Bad Hair""). This is an album about tiny quality of life improvements to be made in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It might not be the message we want in a year where systemic police and judicial inequality have cost many the ultimate price, but that doesn’t bankrupt it of value. To Pimp a Butterfly pivots on the polarizing lead single, ""i"". Upon release last autumn, the sunny soul pep talk came off lightweight and glib. When it appears deep in the back end of Butterfly, though, ""i"" plays less like the jingle we heard last year and more like the beating heart of the matter. To push the point, the album opts for a live-sounding mix that ditches out midway through, giving way to a speech from the rapper himself. In tone, the speech is not unlike the legendary 1968 concert where James Brown waved off security and personally held off a Boston audience’s fury after news broke that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. ""How many niggas we done lost, bro?"" Kendrick shouts over the crowd. ""It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left."" Underneath the tragedy and adversity, To Pimp a Butterfly is a celebration of the audacity to wake up each morning to try to be better, knowing it could all end in a second, for no reason at all.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/,"Interscope,Aftermath,Top Dawg",2015.0
157,Led Zeppelin,Led Zeppelin IV,Rock,9.1,February 24 2015,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"With Led Zeppelin, there was no break-in period, no ""early phase"" where they figured out what kind of band they wanted to be. They were fully formed from the first repetition of the ""Good Times Bad Times"" riff, and they powered along through their first half-dozen albums crushing everything in their path. Zep never had their Sgt. Pepper's, their Exile, their Who's Next, because every album was more or less that good—for a while, anyway. This was a band that knew the music it wanted to make and executed it with ruthless precision. The second trio of Led Zeppelin reissues (the fourth album and Houses of the Holy came out last fall, Physical Graffiti this week) found the band inhabiting what Neil Tennant once described (and Tom Ewing fleshed out) as their ""imperial phase."" Riding on their massive initial success, and pushed even further by the game-changing success of ""Stairway to Heaven"", everything they tried during these years somehow worked. If you grew up on classic rock radio, you sometimes felt like you were listening to Led Zeppelin's fourth album on shuffle. It has eight songs, all of them are huge, and one, ""Stairway to Heaven"", frequently lingers near the top of lists of the Greatest Rock Songs of All Time. Given its place in culture, IV can seem like an album of moments more than songs. Individual parts have been selected, cropped, amplified, and dropped into both songs by other artists and into our collective unconscious. Every song has two or three sections that are instantly identifiable and always seem to be playing somewhere nearby. The circular guitar figure in ""Black Dog""; the chiming mandolin in ""Going to California""; Bonham's cymbal bashing on ""Rock and Roll"". It's hard to hear ""When the Levee Breaks"", by now, and not think of hip-hop. If Led Zeppelin's music formed the DNA of anything that could remotely be called ""hard rock,"" IV is a petri dish overflowing with stem cells. The debut was darker and moodier, II was heavier, and III was prettier, but the fourth album is a triumph of form meeting function. ""Stairway to Heaven"" is so ubiquitous that it cycles through phases of deep reverence and self-parody, and the movement between these two poles is so rapid it all becomes a blur. This happens both for individual listeners (I'm going to guess the very young still discover this song and have their idea of what a rock song can be expanded considerably) and on the level of mass culture. It's both a marker of religion and an instant punchline, a singularity that sucks in a world of experience and observation and jeering laughter and sincere tears and compacts it all into an infinitely dense point. Like many who both love it and hate it, I pretty much never need to hear it again. But ""Stairway"" aside, IV is their least weird album. It's basically their stab at perfection, and they get there, but this band was always at its most interesting at the margins, when they had the possibility of failure. By 1973, Zeppelin's only competition for Biggest Band in the World was the Stones, who were losing their hunger. Later that year, the Stones would put out Goat's Head Soup, beginning a period of drift they wouldn't return from until 1978's Some Girls. The field was clear, with the '60s starting to recede in the rearview, but punk was still a couple of years away, Zeppelin didn't waste the opportunity. Houses of the Holy, their fifth album in four years, takes the most powerful moments of the fourth album and amplifies them, and also adds some oddball experiments that flesh out the Led Zeppelin story. They are most in the zone on ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", which is on a very short list of best songs Zep ever wrote, which is to say that it's among the best rock songs ever written. Everything they ever did well—pastoral beauty, crunchy riffs, stop/start changes, monster drum grooves—could be found on this single track. ""The Ocean"" features what could be Jimmy Page's single greatest riff. ""The Rain Song"" is a masterful study in the power of guitar tone, both for its full acoustic strumming and the electric guitar work that has always evoked the weather of its title. John Paul Jones' gorgeous Mellotron passage is one of the definitive uses of that strange instrument. And ""No Quarter"" is a disorienting bad-vibes epic, archetypal of the '70s, capturing the bleak interiority of a certain kind of drug experience. Houses of the Holy is a perfectly reasonable choice for best Zeppelin LP, even if it had signs that the band couldn't last forever. ""The Song Remains the Same"" is the first sign of Robert Plant using a more pinched sound for his upper register, adapting to that gradually disappearing top octave by contorting his vocals into a strange squeal. By the last two Zeppelin records this would be his default approach when singing in this range. ""The Crunge"" is a sour version of funk, a weirdly fascinating half-song complete with a groaner of a James Brown joke. John Bonham supposedly disliked ""D'yer Mak'er"" so much he refused to write an interesting drum part, sticking instead with the first shuffle beat that came to mind. It was Zeppelin's stab at reggae, and though they never try to breathe any space or light into the mix, it's impossible to dismiss the song's easy catchiness, its affection for doo-wop melody, the motion of Page's spindly guitar. Houses of the Holy might be Zeppelin's most impressive album on a purely sonic level, and this particular remaster reinforces that notion. The best remastering jobs always offer a subtle improvement—a touch of EQing here, a bit more volume there without overdoing it. Taken together, they hopefully offer more detail, and these versions make the grade. The bonus discs, however, continue to be disappointing. From one angle, there's actually something admirable about how little Led Zeppelin left in the vaults. It was a testament to their brutal efficiency as a rock machine. But aside from the live set released with the debut, the bonus discs so far have been the definition of ""fans only."" They are mostly filled with ""alternate mixes,"" which is a strange concept. Mixes freeze in time a single moment that is the end result of many individual decisions; they document fader settings. Alternate mixes showing what could have happened are literally infinite; all these mixes are said to have been created while the album was being mixed, and there is no reason to doubt that, but the truth is Page could just as easily make an ""alternate mix"" of any one of these songs this morning and no one would know the difference. The fact that a mandolin was briefly considered to be slightly louder for a given sound is basically a stray fact and nothing more. All it provides is a chance to hear familiar performances in familiar songs in a way that sounds slightly unfamiliar. Among the first six records, aside from III, Physical Graffiti suffers least from overfamiliarity. It's Led Zeppelin's White Album, the one they made when they were at their creative peak and had a million ideas, but were also under a tremendous amount of strain and saw the end starting to come into focus. It's also, to my ears, their best album, even if it's not as unified or complete as some of what had come before. Why their best? First of all, there's more of it. The previous two albums were awesome, but each had just eight songs; Physical Graffiti has 15. It's math—when you are talking about songs from this period of the band, that makes it roughly twice as good. But Physical Graffiti is Zeppelin's best album ultimately because it felt like a culmination. In some senses it was literally so, since its tracks had been recorded over the course of the previous few years and, in some cases, were leftovers from the previous few records. (The best of the new material was still too much for a single record, so they went back to unreleased songs and decided to flesh out a full 2xLP. The songs are all over the place, but the band makes it all work together.) Iconic riffs abound—""Custard Pie"", ""The Wanton Song"", and ""Houses of the Holy"" alone have more hooks than most rock bands manage in a career—but here they are just the beginning of the story. ""In My Time of Dying"" is Zeppelin's ultimate blues deconstruction, mixing the open-chord slide of acoustic Delta blues with electric heaviness and extending the whole thing past 11 minutes. Pastoral instrumentals had been in the mix for Zeppelin since the first album's ""Black Mountainside"", but Page never managed another one as beautiful as ""Bron-Yr-Aur"", a crushingly brief two minutes of guitar bliss that every rock kid who picked up an acoustic guitar in the next 10 years dreamed of playing. And their non-Western dabbling crested with ""Kashmir"". But Physical Graffiti's greatest strength is its looseness and general sense of playfulness. Here and there, Zeppelin showed comfort with pop. The bounce of ""Trampled Under Foot"" owes everything to Stevie Wonder; ""Down By the Seaside"" has an easeful lilt; and ""Night Flight"" twinkles with a bright optimism. The song I returned to most here is also the simplest—""Boogie With Stu"", an interpolation of Ritchie Valens' ""Ooh My Head"" (his mother gets a songwriting credit). It makes me think of what blues and early rock'n'roll meant to a certain generation of young men growing up in England during the 1950s and '60s. You hear one story after another about lives being changed by a rock'n'roll record. In a famous quote, John Lennon summed up his musical taste to Jann Wenner in a 1971 Rolling Stone interview: ""Sounds like 'Wop Bop a Loo Bop'. I like rock and roll, man, I don't like much else."" When the members of Led Zeppelin get together with famed session pianist/long-time pal Ian Stewart on ""Boogie With Stu"", you can hear five people who speak the same language. It's drunk on the joy of the discovery. Whatever else they have going on in their lives, they can sit down and play a chugging 12-bar song and have a fucking ball, because they remember when they first heard a song like this as kids and realized that song was a portal to another world. On Physical Graffiti, the end point of Led Zeppelin's incomparable initial run, they are living deep inside that new world, still finding new things to discover, taking it all in.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19834-led-zeppelin-ivhouses-of-the-holyphysical-graffiti/,"Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino",1971.0
158,Lil Wayne,Sorry 4 the Wait 2,Rap,6.4,January 30 2015,Renato Pagnani,Contributor,"Sorry 4 the Wait 2 shouldn't exist. If Lil Wayne had his way, we'd be listening to Tha Carter V right now, originally scheduled for release in October, which turned into early December, which came and went with only a series of frustrated tweets from the rapper. It's not strange for artists to complain about the glacial pace at which record labels often move, but Wayne's tweets felt less like a display of temporary discontent and more like the words of an artist that has reached the end of their rope—it doesn't get much more black and white than ""I want off this label and nothing to do with these people."" With rumors swirling that Wayne is ready to take his label, Cash Money, along with his long-time mentor and father figure Bryan ""Birdman"" Williams to court, the possibility of a reconciliation between the estranged parties seems less and less likely with each passing day. Amidst this intra-label drama, there feels like there's something at stake in Wayne's music again. Whereas the first Sorry 4 the Wait served a similar function—it was a prime example of mixtape as apology—its sequel carries a sense that its star has his back against the wall for the first time in years. There's a purpose in Wayne's rapping that's been absent for a while, and when mentioning his current situation with Cash Money, he sounds wounded in a way he's rarely allowed himself to be. Over O.T. Genasis' ""CoCo"", he raps in an exasperated sigh: ""Tunechi, niggas don't appreciate you/ You've been down since day one, it meant nothing on day two."" In 2015, Wayne's approach to mixtapes—rapping over beats popularized by other rappers—is an anachronism. These days, the tapes of even the greenest rappers contain mostly, if not entirely, original work. At his peak, Wayne would make beats his own through a manic inventiveness that he's still trying to recapture almost a decade later. There aren't any performances here that will have you dragging the originals to the recycle bin, but there are moments that thrill, like when he lifts the melody of Rich the Kid's hook from Migos' ""Jumpin' Like Jordan"" and then takes it in about eight different directions on ""Trap House"". If there's a word that describes Wayne's rapping on Sorry 4 the Wait 2, it's ""engaged."" Wayne remains really good at the physical act of rapping, even if now you can hear the gears lurching into action whenever he switches into a double-time flow, like he does on ""Selsun Blue"", which finds him dropping quotables again (""Got the yay locked down like Kim K."") over the minor-key dread of Roofeeo's ""All About the Money"" beat. With that said, what used to be knee-slappers have been forehead-palmers for a few years now, and what he presumably considers clever is usually less so by at least half. Mercifully, the groaners-per-minute ratio here is lower than usual, and this is likely due to the fact Wayne's got more than just bad sex puns on his mind. Wayne's in a weird position: his style has been so thoroughly picked apart that, in many cases, rappers who have absorbed traits of his have taken them to even further extremes. For instance, ""Off Day"", the immediately-forgettable single he released in November, saw him try to play the oddball. At different points on that song, he sounds like Drake, iLoveMakonnen, and Young Thug—basically, everyone but himself—and it's as cringe-worthy as it is transparent. On Sorry 4 the Wait 2, he's enjoying being Lil Wayne again, for better or worse. It also feels like rapping is once more a choice rather than a contractual obligation, which, at this point, might be the single greatest compliment one can pay Lil Wayne.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20186-sorry-4-the-wait-2/,Self-released,2015.0
159,J. Cole,2014 Forest Hills Drive,Rap,6.9,December 11 2014,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"J. Cole is a student of hip-hop, the kind who moves to New York to stalk Jay-Z for an opportunity to rap for him, peppers his lyrics with nods to the greats, and pens an apology to Nas when his biggest single comes across as too poppy. Cole is aware of the structure and pace of good rap albums and anxious to apply them to his own music. For his third record, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, he channels the nostalgic self-mythology of Jay-Z’s Black Album. The cover is shot at his childhood home as Eminem did on the Marshall Mathers LP. The tracklist swaps s’s for z’s (“Wet Dreamz”, “A Tale of 2 Citiez”, “Love Yourz”) like 2pac’s All Eyez on Me. With 2014, Cole is certain he’s made his classic; he’ll tell you as much partway through the 15-minute credit roll “Note to Self”, which apes Kanye West’s joyous, candid College Dropout closer “Last Call”. Problem is, Cole hasn’t earned it yet. J. Cole is a workmanlike MC, a good-natured populist grappling with the ridiculousness of sudden celebrity. He makes passable albums with memorable singles. He’s great at synthesizing everyman relationship woes into terse pop nuggets. He works well with guests; his collaborations with Drake, Missy Elliott, and TLC are highlights in his growing body of work, and he gets along so well with Kendrick Lamar that the duo is rumored to have clandestinely recorded an EP together. In its quest to canonize Cole, 2014 Forest Hills Drive eschews both singles and guests. It’s a block of Cole raps and Cole hooks served mostly over Cole beats. Bold move, and where it floats, it soars, but it flops gloriously when it doesn’t. The laughable wordplay fails of mixtapes albums past (“My money like a senior, watch it graduate,” “Cole heating up like that leftover lasagna”) are thankfully absent, but Cole isn’t yet sharp enough of a storyteller to carry a full album on his own. “Wet Dreamz” recounts his first time having sex in lurid detail, from lying to a girl about his prowess to looking at porn for pointers to finding out the girl’s been lying, too. It’s relatable but hardly the kind of story you want to hear more than once. “No Role Modelz” parlays a suspicion about a hookup being a golddigger into a tirade about black women lacking respectable public figures, crudely suggesting that “she’s shallow but the pussy deep.” (For all the talk of Cole’s enlightenment he’s a perfect brute when it comes to women, and “No Role Modelz” is something of a tacit admission.) 2014 Forest Hills Drive often plays at a depth it never delivers. Still, ceding an entire hour to a rapper who works best in short bursts works better here than anyone could’ve expected. “03’ Adolescence” flips the classic rags-to-riches narrative inside out as Cole starts to reminisce about how hard he had it growing up only to get a chin check from a friend whose future isn’t half as bright. “G.O.M.D.”, “Fire Squad”, and “A Tale of 2 Citiez” all flash Cole’s technical excellence, while “Intro”, “Apparently”, and “St. Tropez” emote through his gruff singing voice. The production here is never less than delightful; Cole’s own beats run coyly referential samples through milky instrumental embellishments. “Wet Dreamz” is an adept “Impeach the President” flip, and “St. Tropez” reimagines Mobb Deep’s “Give Up the Goods (Just Step)” as sedate, orchestral R&B. 2014 Forest Hills Drive is Cole planting himself in the pantheon of rap greats, a volley to the spike of Kendrick Lamar’s “Control” verse. He gets more than a little ahead of himself, though, claiming to be better than Slick Rick, LL Cool J, Rakim, and Big Daddy Kane on “January 28th”. Kane and Rakim’s flows were tighter, LL’s swagger is inimitable, and Rick’s stories surge with a purpose nothing in J. Cole’s canon can muster. This self-aggrandizing pageantry is a ultimately bad look on a guy who earns his keep speaking to the struggles of the common man, and these songs work best when they’re not busy telling you how good they think they are. 2014 Forest Hills Drive is a decent album selling itself as great. It wraps itself in the garments of a classic, but you can see that the tailoring is off.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20054-2014-forest-hills-drive/,"Columbia,Roc Nation,Dreamville",2014.0
160,Wu-Tang Clan,A Better Tomorrow,Rap,5.9,December 3 2014,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"The Wu-Tang Clan’s seminal debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) turned 20 last fall, commemorated in a litany of glowing reminiscences and a lengthy intercontinental festival tour. There was a clean-cut finality to the proceedings, a sense that the group was sending off a movement that had finally run its course. Producer and de facto group leader RZA thought he’d get the guys together for one last job and spent the year trying to will a new Wu-Tang album into existence in time for 36 Chambers’ November anniversary. The date came and went, but no album surfaced (though we did get ""Family Reunion"", a sentimental homecoming over a perhaps-too-chunky slice of the O’Jays’ 1975 hit of the same name). Work was plagued by old complaints about RZA’s lush live band arrangements flying in the face of the claustrophobic kung fu grit of the Clan’s classics. Raekwon publicly challenged RZA’s authority and boycotted the sessions. The new album had a name (A Better Tomorrow, after the emotional Wu-Tang Forever cut) but no fully functioning group to record it. Tense negotiations and a reconciliation followed, but A Better Tomorrow arrives this week illuminating the early apprehensions. The production here is more of a piece with the muscular soundtrack work of RZA’s 2012 directorial debut The Man With the Iron Fists than anything bearing the Wu-Tang name, barring the heavily orchestrated bits of 2007’s 8 Diagrams that inspired Raekwon’s last mutiny attempt. But A Better Tomorrow’s thick and moody soundscapes run off-puttingly perpendicular to the group’s cerebral storytelling. ""Felt"" practically drowns memorable turns from Ghostface Killah and Method Man in unnecessary drum-n-bass flourishes. Inspectah Deck and Cappadonna come off uncharacteristically plodding over the fluid, proggy groove of ""Mistaken Identity"". Sounds that were once punishing, tumbling out of shoddy recording equipment in a home studio, are distractingly pretty, pumped full of all the crack session playing A Better Tomorrow favors. Where overbearing arrangements don’t get in the way, a cloying sentimentality does. 4th Disciple delivers one of the album’s better productions with ""Miracle"", but a drippy, beatless chorus and melodramatic coda hack the momentum out from under suspenseful verses. ""Felt"" nicks a chorus from the mawkish '70s weeper ""Feelings"", and the hokey, swinging Dusty Springfield homage of ""Preacher’s Daughter"" is only listenable for Meth and Ghost’s flexible senses of humor. The title track fits the methodical build of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes’ ""Wake Up Everybody"" under suitably socially conscious verses, but right as you start to hope they’re not just going to play the actual chorus of the original in full, they do, strings ramped noxiously high in the mix. By the time ""Family Reunion"" hits, A Better Tomorrow will have felt more like a karaoke bar’s old school night than a new album by the guys who gave us ""C.R.E.A.M."" and ""Triumph"". When A Better Tomorrow commits to sounding like an actual Wu-Tang affair it starts to cook. Longtime Wu associate Mathematics brings Meth and GZA to life with a lively soul chop on the album’s lead single ""Keep Watch"" and imbues ""40th Street Black/We Will Fight"" with the spirit of The W’s upbeat but by no means peppy ""Gravel Pit"". ""Pioneer the Frontier"" fashions the energy of ramshackle W deep cut ""Careful (Click, Click)"" into a menace RZA can’t even kill when he signs verse one off with ""Holla at the moon, my goons at Coachella."" ""Necklace"" and ""Ron O’Neal"" follow suit in piling on the soot, and for a moment, this thing is heavy enough to bear the weight of the name on the cover. But all too often, A Better Tomorrow prefers to bask in those idyllic blue skies instead. Raekwon was right: RZA’s vision no longer suits the rabid, renegade spirit the Wu-Tang Clan represents. He’s helmed a record that’s drunk on its own musicality, one that seems to befuddle the very guys rapping on it. It’s impossible to say how engaged the rest of the members were in recording, whether the wonkier moments here are the result of rappers disinterested in their own beats or production crafted awkwardly around pre-existing verses. But it’s deeply telling that the night the Wu-Tang Clan was set to release its first album in seven years (and possibly, its last one ever), Raekwon was already pushing something else entirely on Twitter. The union hasn’t worked in a while, and rather than hiding irreparable fissures by posting up a unified front to tickle fan nostalgia, better to let it crystallize unblemished in memory. Keep up appearances for the kids if you like, but trust and believe that they can tell when something is off.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20043-wu-tang-clan-a-better-tomorrow/,Warner Bros.,2014.0
161,David Bowie,Nothing Has Changed (3-CD Deluxe Edition),Rock,8.8,November 20 2014,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"To pick a few selected works from an artist's career is to construct an argument about that artist. Every curator knows that, and David Bowie is nothing if not a curator. The first great Bowie best-of was 1976's Changesonebowie LP, whose argument was that he was a mamapapa comin' for you, a rocker too strong and too glittery to be pinned down. (The 1981 Changestwobowie LP and the 1990 Changesbowie CD, stabbed in its gut by the dreadful remix ""Fame '90"", tried to extend that premise.) Bowie's initial attempt at a full-career assessment was the 1989 Sound + Vision box set, revised and updated in 2003. In both forms, it's a bunch of hits and album tracks and rarities clumped together, an impressive show of range whose failure is that it assumes, rather than argues, that he's a rock god and that therefore anything he does is interesting. Twenty-five years later, coinciding with an actual touring museum exhibition of the apparatus around his music, Bowie has assembled a new retrospective. Nothing Has Changed—a very sly title, as a riposte to Changesonebowie and ""Changes"", especially since it's also a lyric lifted from his 2002 song ""Sunday""—comes in three different versions, each with a cover image of Bowie regarding himself in a mirror. That's a sharp gesture too: he's never been shy about his fascination with his own mercurial self, shedding his skin again and again and then carefully preserving it to wriggle into again later. (This is not the first time he's done the ""multiple versions of a greatest-hits set"" trick, either: 2002's Best of Bowie had twenty different track lineups, depending on which country you bought it in.) The weakest of the three versions of Nothing Has Changed is the chronologically sequenced 2xCD version. It's basically just a slight revision of Best of Bowie, compressed to throw in five later songs including the newly recorded oddity ""Sue (or In a Season of Crime)"". The first disc starts with his commercial breakthrough ""Space Oddity"" and ends with its sequel/repudiation ""Ashes to Ashes"", which is a nice bit of symmetry. Mostly, what we get is Bowie as he's understood by oldies radio, although we're seven tracks in before he really starts to toughen up (with ""Ziggy Stardust""). But the second half of the 2xCD version covers three times as many years as the first, and suggests that Bowie was a temporarily interesting trend-follower whose fade-out has been slowed by his being repeatedly propped up and dragged into modernity by big-name collaborators: Queen, Pat Metheny, Pet Shop Boys, Trent Reznor, James Murphy. This Bowie's sense of tune eventually abandons him and never returns. After the look back in sorrow of ""Absolute Beginners"", halfway through the second disc, he's coasting on his rep; it's just one decent comeback attempt after another, with ""Sue"" at the end as a sort of I-give-up-but-here's-something-new-anyway gesture. That's a reasonable case to make; it also misses most of what's magical about this particular artist. The 2xLP version of Nothing Has Changed makes a simpler and happier argument, that this is a dude with a lot of big hits and a peculiar arty streak. It's a non-chronological set, mostly songs that you might want to play if you were DJing a party—three out of 20 are the singles from Let's Dance. The sides have something like thematic unity: Bowie the dancefloor-filler and lighter-waver, Ziggy/Aladdin the glam spaceman, David the magisterial vocalist and pop experimentalist (this is where ""Sue"" lands), and You-Know-Who the introspective eminence grise (concluding with last year's ""Where Are We Now?""). You could do worse. The 3xCD Nothing Has Changed, though, is the jewel among the three variations on the same core material. Its masterstroke is that its 59 tracks appear in reverse chronological order. To end a greatest-hits with ""Sue"" is to remind listeners that there's a good moment to hit the stop button. To begin it with ""Sue""—the longest track on the whole thing—smacks us to attention. This is Bowie as he wants us to encounter him, as a practitioner of fine art whose interests have occasionally, improbably, marvelously intersected with pop of the moment. ""Sue"", written and recorded with Maria Schneider and her jazz orchestra, announces its intentions from the moment Bowie's actorly baritone warbles in: it's the latest in his line of homages to Scott Walker, the double whose guise is the one role he's never been able to play. (The artistic relationship between Bowie and Walker—so similar, so different—is a complicated topic on its own; the comprehensive Bowie blog Pushing Ahead of the Dame includes a pair of brilliant posts about it.) For at least the rest of its first disc, the 3xCD version reframes latter-day Bowie as an alternate-universe version of Walker, a solemn avant-gardist who keeps trying to rocket out beyond pop and keeps being drawn back into its gravity well. That makes his later work a lot more interesting, it turns out. This is a Bowie who never runs out of fresh ways to gaze back at himself in the mirror. There are three tracks here from his never-released 2001 album Toy: reworked versions of a pair of songs from his youth, and the lovely obscurity ""Your Turn to Drive"", which is as close as he's ever come to dreampop. And it's hard to miss the science fiction that's never totally left his lyrics when James Murphy's remix of ""Love Is Lost"" (with its quotation from ""Ashes to Ashes"") appears next to ""The Stars (Are Out Tonight)"" and ""New Killer Star"", and just down the hall from Pet Shop Boys' reworking of ""Hallo Spaceboy"" (which itself incorporates a William S. Burroughs-style cut-up of lines from ""Space Oddity""). The edited and remixed versions of Bowie's post-1995 singles that populate the first disc are all distinct improvements on their original versions; you'd be forgiven for wondering if 1999's dismal Hours... was as good as it seems here. Single mixes are the meat of the rest of Nothing Has Changed too, because the metric for inclusion even on the longest version is, more or less, which songs were some kind of hit. (Although it's worth noting that a collection of Bowie's U.S. Top 40 singles would be 10 songs long and end with 1987's ""Day-In Day-Out"" and ""Never Let Me Down"", neither of which appear here. We do get ""The Man Who Sold the World""—which was never a single and didn't appear on a major Bowie compilation until 1997—and ""All the Young Dudes"", a hit for Mott the Hoople whose studio recording Bowie didn't even release until the mid-90s.) Nonetheless, there's some curation going on here. Nothing Has Changed is a version of Bowie's career in which his circa-1990 hard rock quartet Tin Machine never happened (that's just fine, actually). Cultural currency and UK chart success are no guarantee of inclusion: there's no ""D.J."", no ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"", no ""Suffragette City"", no ""John, I'm Only Dancing"", no ""Queen Bitch"", and don't even ask about ""The Laughing Gnome"". Undignified moments like the Labyrinth soundtrack and ""Real Cool World"" have been expunged from this particular record (although somehow ""Dancing in the Street"" wasn't—the musicless version of that one is preferable.). The ""Berlin trilogy"" of albums is represented by one quick blast apiece (""Boys Keep Swinging"" into ""'Heroes'"" into ""Sound and Vision"", shoulder to shoulder in glory). But its swift, forceful backward flow through Bowie's waves of reinvention and discovery is worth more than any kind of completeness would be. What the 3xCD museum tour of Nothing offers instead is a treat in its final chamber. It keeps on zooming past ""Space Oddity"" to Bowie's juvenilia, the five years' worth of grasps at the brass ring that preceded Major Tom's rocket to the stars. (David Bowie Is, the actual museum show, also includes his youthful presentiments of what would come later.) Here, again, the reverse chronology works marvelously. ""Silly Boy Blue"" anticipates the voice we've been hearing all the way from ""Sue"" on back; ""Liza Jane"" (the recorded debut of ""Davie Jones"") and ""You've Got a Habit of Leaving"" are the work of a teenager learning to play a more complicated version of dress-up. And ""Can't Help Thinking About Me"", the first single for which he tried on the David Bowie name, becomes a key to the whole exhibition: a beautiful young Narcissus, shedding his identity for the first time, and already looking back on what he's left behind himself.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20004-david-bowie-nothing-has-changed/,"Columbia,Legacy,Columbia,Legacy,Columbia,Legacy",2014.0
162,Pink Floyd,The Endless River,Rock,5.7,November 13 2014,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Because The Endless River is so steeped in Pink Floyd lore, it’s worth going back at least momentarily to the very beginning. Nearly half a century ago, the band started life as a middling blues-rock outfit in London, patterned largely after the Stones albeit with a much smaller repertoire. To fill sets they would extend the songs they did know to great lengths; to justify not rehearsing, they emphasized onstage improvisation. Any technical insufficiencies were masked by sheer volume. Everything read as psychedelic and new, as their still developing chops took the band to places more skilled musicians might bypass altogether. The response was intense: Critics predicted that Floyd would replace the Beatles, and fans lined up around the block for happenings at the UFO Club and Seymour Hall. As the band progressed, of course, they refined their chops as well as their ambitions—the usual course for DIY musicians (except for Syd Barrett, who quickly absented himself from the scene after spearheading their 1967 debut, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn). Guitarist David Gilmour, brought in to replace Barrett, developed a graceful and patient style that lent Roger Waters’ songs a sense of eloquence and scale. Drummer Nick Mason honed his R&B beats into narcotized motorik timing, and Rick Wright tinkered with synthesizers to add fizzy drama to 1975’s ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", which updated '60s psych to '70s prog and remains his best moment. All of them—sans Waters, who left the band back in the '80s—figure prominently on The Endless River, a long, predominantly instrumental album that is said to be Pink Floyd’s final cut. All the familiar sounds are here, with each member playing his usual role. The liquid sound of Gilmour’s guitar is immediately recognizable when it enters on the second track, tracing curlicues around the straight lines of Wright’s synths. The song could be ""Run Like Hell"" in slo-mo or the first half of Wish You Were Here, only with a gentler, more ambient thrust. The title is a wink: ""It's What We Do"". As regrettable as that album cover may be, it provides a useful metaphor for the relationship between the guitarist and the keyboardist: Gilmour is the punter guiding the boat, Wright is the cloud upon which he floats. Which leaves Mason as the oar, perhaps. Sadly, Wright died of cancer in 2008, long before The Endless River was even a consideration. To create a swan song for a perennially underrated rock musician, Gilmour and Mason—along with producers Phil Manzanera, Andy Jackson, and Youth—sifted through hours upon hours of sessions from 1994’s The Division Bell, highlighting Wright’s contributions and turning them into new songs. So River is to Wright what Wish You Were Here was to Barrett: a eulogy of sorts, a commemoration of his contributions to the band in particular and to rock in general. Perhaps the band’s most backwards-looking album, it is quintessentially and self-consciously Pink Floyd, for better or for worse. The Endless River is stately, grandiose, and searching, but it is also bloated, pompous, and so conceptually top-heavy it just might fall off the CD rack or crash your computer. Rather than scrappy young dudes playing to hallucinating fans in the '60s, Pink Floyd have long since become wizened music veterans. As such, they may be too professional and perhaps even too rich to make this music sound like anything other than a luxury item, an option on a sports car or a demonstration CD for home theaters. It’s been decades since we expected grit and glower from the band, but by the time Gilmour starts singing—18 tracks and 46 minutes into the album!—you might suspect that River syncs up perfectly with Cocoon. Not that guys their age can’t make vital music, but the only hint of the passage of time here is their refined chops. And we already knew they could play. In other words, Floyd’s best and worst impulses are crammed into these 52 minutes. ""Sum"" and ""Skins"" are admirably weird, as though the band went as far out as they dared and then took a few more steps. Thanks to the menacingly descending bass line and Mason’s tense drum solo, you can almost see the pulsing laser light show. Those songs elevate the first and second side, promising a more adventurous album than Pink Floyd deliver. The boat sinks beneath the clouds: As The Endless River threatens to live up to its title, the music veers into aimless, repetitive noodling, and the band settle for formless ambience rather than exactingly sculpted songs. There are a few disruptions, such as the Wall-size chords that open ""Allons-y (1)"" and a monologue by Stephen Hawking on the unfortunately titled ""Talkin’ Hawkin'"", but such flourishes more often prove embarrassing: Gilad Atzmon’s saxophone turns ""Anisina"" into an '80s sitcom theme, and the pipe organ on ""Autumn '68"" plays as a parody of Pink Floyd’s oceanic sound. Perhaps the sax is obligatory, a nod to Dick Parry’s solos on Wish You Were Here. That would make sense, given the retrospective bend to The Endless River. For the devoted fan, these songs may comprise something like a musical memoir, with references to Wright and Barrett and even Waters (""We bitch and we fight…"") as well as to previous songs and albums. Even the title takes inspiration from the final song on The Division Bell, an album which also featured guest vocals by Hawking. That kind of self-referentiality lends much-needed import to what is ultimately a minor entry in the band’s catalog. And there is something warmly reassuring about the familiarity of these sounds, as though Pink Floyd are settling affairs and squaring accounts. Too often ""familiar"" curdles into ""lazy."" As late as The Division Bell, Pink Floyd appeared to be a band constantly looking forward, intent on innovating their own sound if not rock as a genre. As a result, some of their lesser albums managed to build on previous successes, and even that notorious 1987 disaster A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no deficit of ambition or vision. There's something bold in the smaller scope of The Endless River, but it proves to be one of the few Pink Floyd releases that sounds like a step backwards, with nothing new to say and no new frontiers to explore. Of course, if there are no more Pink Floyd albums, then there is no collective future to anticipate, no new sound to build toward. Gilmour, Mason, and the ghost of Wright are closing out a half-century career not with a grand statement, but with a curious ellipsis.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20006-pink-floyd-the-endless-river/,"Columbia,Parlophone",2014.0
163,John Coltrane,Offering: Live at Temple University,Jazz,8.5,October 28 2014,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"The last eight years of John Coltrane’s life were a period of astonishing creativity. In 1960, he was leaving Miles Davis’ group after a stint during which it was widely understood to be among the greatest jazz units of all time. In 1967, he was at the leading edge of free jazz, creating abstract and unbelievably intense music that left the mainstream far behind. In between he recorded impossibly dense music with a big band (Ascension), ballads and standards albums with Duke Ellington and Johnny Hartman, extended suites (A Love Supreme and Meditations), and had generally pushed jazz as far as it could go. And then, in July 1967, he was gone. During his brilliant run between 1964 and 1967, Albert Ayler, a fellow tenor saxophonist whom Coltrane admired tremendously, seemed like he’d finally found the music he was meant to make. Coltrane was always searching. His music was never content with where it was but was always looking toward what it might be. This would be less interesting if not for the fact that this search is embodied in the sound itself. There’s always something left hanging in Coltrane’s later work—when it ends you feel not just everything that happened but also what might have happened but didn’t. And you sense that he felt same way. He famously told Miles Davis that he played so long because he didn’t know how to end his solos, and Miles famously told him back, “Take the horn out of your mouth.” Eight months before he died, Coltrane played a gig at Temple University. It was recorded by the radio station but has only been heard in partial, poor-quality bootlegs until this year, when it was polished up and issued for this set. The music on Offering shifts between standard ideas of jazz and noise music, regularly tipping over from chords and melody and harmony into the realm of pure sound. So I tend to experience music like this as a visceral thing, something to be played loudly that can be both beautiful and frightening. The last two years of Coltrane’s life found him experimenting relentlessly, perhaps aware, on some level, that he only had so much time to get it all in. He used extra bassists, extra drummers, new kinds of percussionists, expanded ensembles. On this night in Philadelphia, he had some of all these things: a couple of extra saxophone players he knew from the area as well as Umar Ali, Algie DeWitt, and Robert Kenyatta on percussion. I’m obligated to point them out because they are in the credits and they were an important part of this gig as the people in the room experienced it. But the truth is, this recording, all done through one microphone without much thought for posterity, misses a great deal of sound from those extra drummers and percussionists and, indeed, from the pianist, Alice Coltrane, as well as the bassist, Sonny Johnson. This set puts the focus squarely on the leader, who was nearest the microphone, and his playing—and vocalizing—made this a special night indeed. In 1966, electric jazz was just around the corner; the music would later get denser and more intense, it would mix with rock or go way over into the realm of abstraction. Coltrane himself seemed to be returning from the edge of chaos. Live in Japan, recorded in July 1966 but not released in full until 1991, was about as far “out” as he got, stretching tunes that once lasted for eight or nine minutes to nearly 60, and filling them with explosive atonal blowing. But by the time this set was recorded, he was returning to Earth as if after an armageddon, seeing what was left. He starts here with “Naima”, a pretty tune written in 1959 that later became a standard. The harmonic structure is difficult to puzzle out, but Coltrane plays with force and clarity, in a melodic mode even as the tune differs from the familiar lines. It does, however, have Alice Coltrane’s longest solo, an intense banging thing that reveals the nature of her genius. (She could be a superb soloist on two instruments as a leader, but her distinctive voice never quite emerged in her husband’s band.) You have to use some imagination to hear the song inside of it. “Crescent” is almost unbearably intense, the brittle shrieking egged on by someone yelling “Hey!” in the background. Melody and harmony are sacrificed at the altar of texture and feeling, anger and joy bleed into sadness. Once in a while you can hear a cowbell in the background, and you get a glimpse of what it might have been like to be here on this night. “Leo”, one studio version of which was found on the Coltrane/Rashied Ali duo album Interstellar Space, was another staple of Coltrane’s sets during this period, and its hyper-bouncing opening theme sets the stage for a long and intense blowing session. This is Ali’s turn to solo, and he does so beautifully, the articulation of every hit coalescing into a blur of feeling, his drums showing greater clarity when other instruments drop out. During the following track, “Leo”, something unusual happens, a moment that has been mentioned extensively in the marketing of this release: Coltrane sets aside his horn, and starts to vocalize, singing phrases while beating on his chest to give his vocals an effect something like vibrato. The first thing that comes to mind with this gesture is that perhaps Coltrane had reached a point where his instrument couldn’t convey the feelings he had locked inside; it spilled out beyond the realm of technique, and there should be no object between the expression and the reception. This is what I think of when considering a piece of music recorded eight months later, by Albert Ayler, at John Coltrane’s funeral, when he gives over the last few minutes of his performance to ecstatic and tortured screams. But Coltrane was never quite as unhinged as Ayler, he always tempered emotion with his intellect, and his music, even at its wooliest, always had a sense of control. So Coltrane’s vocals are best heard as an extension in texture, a musical expression as opposed to just an emotional one. And they do add much here—every time his voice comes in, it’s disarming. By the time the record gets to the iconic “My Favorite Things”, we’re reminded that Coltrane was doing some strange things with the tune by this point, most notably starting it with a bass solo that lasted several minutes. You’re in a certain headspace as a music listener when you’re sitting through bass solos that go on for that long, but when the tune finally kicks in, it’s still fascinating to follow where Coltrane was taking this song. At points, his soprano saxophone trills away on repetitions that suggest Steve Reich-like minimalism, elsewhere the music leans toward noisy drone. “My Favorite Things” was a center of gravity that Coltrane would move around, sometimes examining it from a distance, taking in the beauty of the whole, and sometimes veering so close to it he threatened to burn up. And while I wouldn’t put this version in the top 10 of ones I’ve heard, it’ll never get old for me. Considering his stature in American music, every note of John Coltrane’s music deserves release. That’s a given. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that every note has something for the broader music listening public. Offering passes that test, it’s both an “important” jazz release and one that’s actually enjoyable to listen to.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19522-offering-live-at-temple-university/,"Impulse!,Resonance",2014.0
164,The Budos Band,Burnt Offering,"Global,Pop/R&B",7.3,October 23 2014,Jason Heller,Contributor,"After three albums of uniformly excellent, Afrofunk-fueled instrumentals—titled, tellingly, The Budos Band, The Budos Band II, and The Budos Band III—where were the Budos Band to go? As great as their output has been to date, the New York ensemble had more or less painted themselves into a corner. In truth, there were many directions the group could have headed toward on their fourth album, but they dauntingly chose the path of most imaginable resistance: doom metal. Rub your eyes all you want; it won’t change that sentence. The Budos Band’s new album is called Burnt Offering—and from its wizard-sporting cover on down, it draws heavily from the late-'60s/early-'70s well of dark, arcane proto-metal. To be perfectly clear: This is not your uncle’s Primus-shirted funk-metal. The majority of Burnt Offering is built on the same framework that the Budos Band has always used—elegantly simple guitar, deep pockets of syncopation, and bold shouts of brass—but here it’s been wreathed in the thick organ vamps of the bands that helped inspire metal, namely Iron Butterfly and Uriah Heep. Those looking for kvlt cred won’t find it here, nor should they; the album’s heaviest tracks, like the fuzz-slathered “Aphasia” and the gutbucket-distorted title track don’t come anywhere near the metal orthodoxy of Pentagram, let alone Black Sabbath. This is still Afrofunk of the Fela Kuti faith, with “Tomahawk” being the most horn-splashed and intricately polyrhythmic of the bunch. When the delicate guitar intro of “Magus Mountain” drops into a propulsive, blown-out low gear, though, it’s as if Sir Lord Baltimore is jamming with Maggot Brain-era Funkadelic. The fidelity is immaculately retro, saturated and reverberating, which lends an even more eerily anachronistic tone to simmering, sinuous cuts such as “Black Hills” and “Turn and Burn”, the latter of which lands the album in some swampy epoch of alternate history. “Into the Fog” more or less says it all; with organ chords transmogrified into haunted-house groans, and monstrous stomps shuffling somewhere between Blue Öyster Cult's “Godzilla” and Fela’s “Zombie”, the song is all meat, zero subtext. Not that an album this earthy needs anything so subtle to get its freaky point across. Burnt Offering has its own kind of subtlety, and most of it is in the interplay between meter, genre, and mood. When it falls a little flat, on the tame, muted “Trail of Tears” and “Shattered Winds”, it still manages to register as better-than-average Afrofunk with a tasteful layer of filthy hard rock smeared on top. It's not a profound exercise in fusion, and at times it seems the band might be amusing themselves at the expense of being taken seriously. But the most remarkable thing about Burnt Offering is that, at its core, it really isn’t all that much of a departure from what the Budos Band has always done. The neatest trick the album pulls off is in finding the unexplored commonality between Afrofunk and doom metal—deep grooves, murky atmosphere, hypnotic riffs—then playing them with joy and loopy abandon. Spooky, funky, freedom-loving fun: The chance to embrace something like that doesn’t come along often, and it’s to be cherished.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19815-the-budos-band-burnt-offering/,Daptone,2014.0
165,Vince Staples,Hell Can Wait EP,Rap,8.5,October 14 2014,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"West Coast gangsta rap has enjoyed a lasting revival in the wake of Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, m.A.A.d city, with albums by Schoolboy Q, YG, DJ Mustard and others following its lead in advancing the quality and chart traction of narrative-intensive gang-life dispatches. good kid’s unblinking austerity went missing, though, as the infectious levity of Mustard’s airtight party anthems went national, inspiring even Kendrick to inch over to the sunny side with his studiously motivational comeback single “i”. The lesson of good kid—that you could make radio without catering to it—seems lost as L.A. revels in a renewed commercial relevance. Long Beach rapper Vince Staples is sick of cheery street rap. “If you listen to shit about niggas being in a position where they have no hope, there should be nothing at peace about that,” he said in a recent interview with Pitchfork. “There’s a way to do it where it’s listenable and likable, but it shouldn’t just be some happy stuff.” Staples’ own body of work rests on a nervous axis between expressive, imagistic wordplay and somber cynicism. There’s pessimism in the opportunism. There’s stress in the joy. At his peppiest—the chorus of “Feelin’ the Love”, perhaps, the closer on his just-released retail debut Hell Can Wait—he’s still waving at death: “Is you feelin’ amazing? Yeah I’m feelin’ the love/ Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done.” Hell Can Wait is a reminder that living is another word for cheating death. It’s bleak and maybe exasperating, but the reality of the street is that babies gotta eat, jobs are scarce, and some people have to resort to tactics that risk death and imprisonment to make it through the day. There’s no wide-eyed good kid narrating the disorder in Staples' city, just a realist making do with the available options. “Niggas from my home ain’t enrolled in the colleges/ Fuck a class, junkies hitting glass, get the money long,” Vince snarls on “65 Hunnid”. On “Screen Door” he balks at the popularity of imaginary gangsters, asserting that his own home was rawer than any Hollywood adaptation: “Bobby Johnson ain’t my OG/ This ain’t no movie role/ Pops was off the OE/ Tripping, getting his Tookie on.” In the middle of the EP Staples' ire sharpens into an icepick. “Hands Up” protests LAPD's use of excessive force (“They expect respect and nonviolence/ I refuse the right to be silent”) in a diatribe Staples swears isn’t about Ferguson. But in a climate where surveillance cam and cell phone footage have revealed law enforcement bullying and violence against black bodies for a near-daily operation, “Hands Up”’s volatile objection to “Paying taxes for some fucking clowns to ride around whooping niggas’ asses” hits hard from coast to coast. Lead single “Blue Suede” is a curt rejoinder about gang violence being deadly too; the terse chorus—“New shoes with the blue suede/ Young graves get the bouquets”—folds a lifetime of adversity into just a few words, a series of damning images cataloguing the disintegration of hope. That economy is Hell Can Wait’s guiding principle. Staples never wastes a word in exhibiting a hustler’s hard-won resilience, and he’s abetted by producers that buoy his stories without overwhelming them. Leading the charge is Toronto producer Hagler (best known for a co-producer credit on Drake’s “Trophies”). Hagler gifts “Screen Door” and “Limos” their hypnotic poise, but he truly shines on “Blue Suede”, which sounds like a trap artist’s rendering of the moment Dr. Dre thought to slap high pitched Moog lines over breaks, the resulting menace tracing a line of ancestry between L.A.’s riots and Raiders era and today. Elsewhere Lil Wayne associate Infamous effects a Nawlins death march for “65 Hunnid”, and Staples' mentor and label head No I.D. outfits “Hands Up” with a guttural low end fitting of a song that could be considered a spiritual successor to “Fuck tha Police”. Hell Can Wait is a debut for Staples, but it’s really a refinement, the end result of a years long search for the right producer that spawned a string of good but not always great mixtapes and loosies. Even a casual listener could hear the spark—Staples' first fame came from getting the best of known mic terrorist Earl Sweatshirt—but his production values have finally caught up enough to push him past the scrappy sidekick division into the big leagues. In an era where signing to a major label can mean artistic regression, Vince Staples’ jump to Def Jam is a case study in the enduring merit of good old-fashioned artist development. The machine still works sometimes.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19849-vince-staples-hell-can-wait-ep/,Def Jam,2014.0
166,Prince,Art Official Age,"Pop/R&B,Rock",6.5,October 3 2014,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Back in the mid-1990s, Prince and Warner Brothers did not split amicably. Not only did the superstar write the word SLAVE on his face, he also changed his name to an unpronounceable logo that was quickly translated into English as “The Artist Formerly Known As…” Unhappy with faltering sales in the new decade, he tried to release a quick slew of albums in order to get out of his contract, but Warner insisted on waiting the industry-standard two years between major releases. It must have felt like a demotion after Prince more or less owned the 1980s, a decade when even a flop like Under the Cherry Moon could spin off a hit album like Parade. Despite his complaints, however, Prince never regained his former popularity following his departure from Warner; as he struggled to go his own way and keep up with trends he was no longer setting, his independent output quickly grew prodigious and preeningly self-indulgent, ranging from the triple-disc Emancipation in 1996 to the soggy The Rainbow Children in 2001 to the one-two punch of MPLSound and LotusFlow3r in 2009. What’s most surprising about Prince re-signing (or resigning?) with Warner Brothers nearly twenty years later is just how much sense it makes for both parties. The label has welcomed one of its signature stars back to the fold, who brings his never-reissued/never-remastered back catalog with him. They’ve already teased a new edition of Purple Rain—the dream we all dream of—and Prince gets some major-label backing at a time when he seems creatively rejuvenated and newly focused. A string of startlingly solid singles led to Art Official Age, which despite its ludicrous title, is the most engaged Prince has sounded in a long while. In particular, “Breakfast Can Wait” is an AM lovemaking jam that schools R. Kelly with its old-school slink and Prince in supreme pillowtalk mode (“Come here baby, let me put you on my plate”). Musically, Art Official Age is all over the map—gloriously so, in fact—as though Prince is trying to cram a triple album into a single disc. Opener “Art Official Cage” cribs directly from Daft Punk’s more arena-ready moments, building a post-disco banger on some Nile Rodgers-style rhythm guitar. It sounds perhaps too familiar, but the song mimics its source with aplomb and what sounds like Princely arrogance. Cockiness has always looked better on Prince than assless chaps or satin frocks, and the song has a feisty energy that even a new jack swing rap can’t derail. Some of the best songs here are slow jams, like the wishful “This Could Be Us” and “Breakdown”, which sounds like one of the most personally revealing tunes Prince has ever recorded: “Waking up in places that you would never believe,” he sings with what sounds like deep regret. “Give me back the time, you can keep the memories.” As the strings lift the song out of the depths and laserbeams fire at the edges of the music, Prince launches into some vocal contortions that prove his voice has lost none of its wild mutability over the years. It’s the rare moment of true gravity on an album that sounds like Prince actually had a lot of fun making. There’s something reassuring about such good spirits coming from him, as it recalls a much younger Prince whose mischievous smile and eye rolls conveyed a self-possession and self-awareness. On the other hand, the few times he nods to an overarching funk/sci-fi mythology—something about being cryogenically frozen for 50 years and waking up in a society with no first-person pronouns—Prince comes across as a grouchy old guy. “Twenty-four karat hashtag, put your phone in your bag,” he raps on “The Gold Standard”, sounding too much like a man in his mid-50s. Art Official Age is not a return to form by any means, but a modestly exciting Prince album. That’s certainly more than we could expect in 2014, and it’s certainly more than we get out of PlectrumElectrum. Prince recorded the album with his all-female backing band 3rdEyeGirl, which includes drummer Hannah Ford Welton, guitarist Donna Grantis, and bassist Ida Nielsen. All have backgrounds and even degrees in rock and jazz, so it’s obvious they have immense chops. The rhythm section lock down the grooves on the punk-/surf-rock “Marz” and the strutting “Stopthistrain”, and Grantis (formerly a member of the New Power Generation) riffs and solos on “Anotherlove” with Princely abandon. What they don’t have is much of a personality. Recorded live in the studio using analog equipment, the album is nevertheless too proficient, too slick, and too professional to come across as much more than anonymous. They show little of the kinky inventiveness of the Revolution or the innate versatility of the New Power Generation; instead, Plectrum is crammed with predictable rap-rock riffs, vague alt-rock menance, and bloozy showboating. Especially blasting from Paisley Park, this is a perversely unimaginative and restrictive idea of rock‘n’roll, with none of the musical freedom that Prince has traditionally shown. One of the great pop synthesists, he has blended so many different styles and sounds so fluidly that his best music sounded positively utopian: a world without charts or genres, release schedules, or label contracts. Prince and 3rdEyeGirl have good intentions, of course, and at times the album sounds like a rebuttal to the pesky rock-is-dead palaver that so many of the form’s aging practitioners have memorized. “A girl with a guitar is 12 times better than another crazy band o’ boys,” Prince asserts on “Fixurlifeup”. But he’s decrying prefab pop groups while backed by a prefab pop group, preaching female empowerment while playing up the novelty of an all-female band. Both of these albums sound slightly out of time, but at least Art Official Age, despite its flaws, has the bravado to imagine how the pop music of the future might function. By contrast, Plectrum merely duplicates the sounds and politics of rock ‘n’ roll’s stodgy past.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19900-prince-3rdeyegirl-art-official-ageplectrumelectrum/,"Warner Bros.,Warner Bros.",2014.0
167,Led Zeppelin,Led Zeppelin,Rock,9.2,June 12 2014,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"As time moves on and “The 60s” and “The 70s” become not so much historical periods as media creations, it's harder to take for granted what the significant cultural touchstones of those eras actually mean to current-day society. Some of the artists that were once universally appreciated are slipping from memory, while others are having difficulty translating to new generations. The furor greeting each new Beatles enterprise shows their music and image are indeed proving timeless, and they remain relevant for teenagers and septuagenarians alike—but other giants from the late 1960s and early 70s aren’t having it so easy. The Who’s stock has plummeted in the last decade, and it’s getting tougher to find anyone under 35 who cares about a note of their music made after 1971. The Rolling Stones have been at it so long that it’s difficult for younger people to believe that they were once actually good. Pink Floyd still reach some alienated kids, but their most devoted fans are among the graybeard audiophile set. And then there's Led Zeppelin. Zeppelin occupies a unique place among this group of bands, in part because their position was hard to pin down while they were active. They were unimaginably popular from 1969 to 1980, but critical respect was elusive. Their suspect reputation has been somewhat overstated (in the U.S., Rolling Stone panned them early on but eventually came around, while Creem and Circus took them seriously all along) but Led Zeppelin never quite registered with the intelligentsia. They made the heaviest hard rock records ever recorded, but their lyrics tended toward loopy mysticism when they weren’t either stealing ideas outright or wallowing in a kind of hedonism where misogyny was a given. In 2014, Led Zeppelin is typically viewed through one of three lenses: those among the 50-plus set who were actually there hear their music with a nostalgic ear, remembering the days of their youth. There are those who grew up with the assumption that Led Zeppelin were important—let's say 30 to 50 years old—hear them filtered through a second wave of nostalgia, from movie titles like Dazed and Confused and the memory of classic rock radio. To these people (including me), Zeppelin defined an otherworldly image of '70s rock deities, conquering the world on the strength of volume, arena shows, and the baddest riffs the world had ever heard. And then there’s the younger set for whom Zep might seem a little comical, a faintly embarrassing relic from another era even as a certain amount of the music remains undeniable. In one sense, this latter group have more in common with the skeptical critics of the first wave, possessing expectations of ""what music should be"" that don’t necessarily apply for a band that sounds like this. These reissues of Zeppelin’s first three albums are an attempt to reach all of these people, using every tool at the band and label’s disposal. The primary reason these sets are being presented and received as a Big Deal is that they are the first reissues of the digital era (and here I’m using the term to include CDs, which means we’re going back more than 30 years) to include bonus material. The reissues are remastered and are packaged with bonus discs that include previously unreleased live material and studio cuts. The PR push surrounding a big reissue in 2014 inevitably involves sharing things that can spread on social media and hence reach younger kids, while other elements—unheard versions, improved sound—ostensibly entice older fans to re-buy the records. Jimmy Page, always Led Zeppelin’s sonic architect, heard the blues differently. He heard it as sound first, rather than a form or tradition or product of personalities—maybe that’s why he felt so cavalier about ""borrowing"" from blues records without attribution, since you can't copyright a sound—and he understood the trance-inducing element of blues repetition better than anyone: blues as a consciousness-expanding ritual. All of this is clear from the very beginning, as Led Zeppelin is one of music's most assured and fully realized debuts; individually, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were great players, but the whole of their sound somehow exceeded the sum of its parts. But even above the instrumental virtuosity, Led Zeppelin is a triumph of production, each part clear and forceful but adding up to something even more powerful. Just about everything Zep would do at one point is presented here somewhere—trance-rock (“Dazed and Confused”), gorgeous acoustic folk (“Black Mountain Side”), catchy guitar pop (“Good Times Bad Times”), updates on straight blues (“I Can’t Quit You Baby”). They’d do most of these things better later, but this is where they appeared first. Zep sounded so brilliant right out of the gate because Page was already a veteran of the music scene when they started; working as a session guitarist and later with the Yardbirds, he took in the scene and saw what was missing. As much as Zeppelin understood music, at this point words were more or less just sounds. Led Zeppelin also set the tone for a decade of dippy lyrics. If Zep was never accepted as hip in some circles, it’s partly because of the knuckle-dragging worldview of songs like “Dazed and Confused”. It’s hard not to laugh or cringe in 2014 when hearing a line like “Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay/ Try and love you baby but you push me away,” but it’s equally difficult not to acknowledge that Robert Plant delivers them with a certain histrionic power. And then a bar later, John Bonham’s slow fills and Page’s terrifying guitar screech come in, and the true meaning of the music is found. It’s truly impossible to oversell how brilliantly these records are produced; “rock” as an idea is really a ’70s idea, and Led Zeppelin established what that would mean and what it would sound like, which was as much a matter of arrangement as it was knowing where to set the microphones, how high to mix the bass. You can hear that on the bonus disc to the first album, which was recorded live in Paris in 1969 and aired on radio. The recording fidelity, for a release by such a major band, is remarkably poor—which goes to show how well the vaults have already been cleared out—but there’s no doubting just how much this band could rip in their first year. Of particular note is the attack of Plant’s singing, as he comes over like the unhinged 22-year-old he was. The earliest live recordings by bands are so exciting in large part because the vocalist hasn’t yet learned how to pace himself; Plant sings these songs like Zeppelin might last a year and this is his one chance to get it right. By the late ’70s, purely as a matter of survival, he’d learn how to coast on stage. There is no arguing with a riff. It’s a conversation-ender, something resistant to analysis that strips away the intellectual to situate the music in a purely physical space. Of the 100 greatest guitar riffs in the history of rock music, Jimmy Page might have written 20, and a good number of those can be found on Led Zeppelin’s second album from 1969. If you or someone close to you has ever been within 10 feet of a radio tuned to a classic rock station, you’ve heard them all, many times—maybe too many. For every young person who discovers “Whole Lotta Love” and “Heartbreaker” and “Living Loving Maid (She’s Just a Woman)”, there’s an older person who gets sick of them from overplay and doesn’t need to ever hear them again. Part of the challenge and excitement of revisiting a record upon reissue is trying to hear the music again with fresh ears, seeing if you can tap into that feeling of discovery that came from hearing it the first time. When I’m able to mentally put myself into this place— the kid who got his driver’s license a month ago, driving around listening to II on tape—the reissue sounds as thrilling as ever. Every track on this record is musically brilliant, and in the span of just a few months it’s amazing how much Page had enriched the band’s sound. Chiming acoustic guitars provide the contrast to the crunch in a whole new way on “Ramble On” and “Thank You”, offering yet another template for mixing folk with proto-metal. “Whole Lotta Love” might have gotten the band sued by Willie Dixon, but there was no sonic precedent for it in rock music—it’s a sound that would have been unimaginable without the rise of drug culture. If you are not a drummer, it’s hard to imagine listening to “Moby Dick” very often, but better evidence of John Bonham’s genius is found elsewhere on the record. Zep’s rhythmic underpinning, especially the locked-in tandem of Jones and Bonham, was always their secret weapon, the thing that divided them from contemporaries like Black Sabbath. They could swing, they loved James Brown and Motown, and they took pride in the fact that people would dance at their shows. The bonus disc is a mildly interesting amalgam of alternate mixes and rough takes—the kind of stuff anyone but the most dedicated obsessives will listen to only once—and there’s little advance here lyrically from the debut, but II is still close to perfect. III is, indirectly, Led Zeppelin’s own version of Pink Floyd's Meddle—the folky, pretty early record that was never too popular and hence a favorite of indie types skeptical of such a massive mainstream band. That it opens with “Immigrant Song”, one of their top few rockers, only makes the later acoustic loveliness that much more affecting. The strings laid atop the acoustic guitar on “Friends” foreshadow “Kashmir”; “Tangerine” has an amazing tension between the minor-key verses and the open, joyous chorus, as good an example of any of Zep as a pop band. The melancholy ache of “That’s the Way” is Zep with their guard down—it goes down as easy as a great Cat Stevens song—and then by the end of the record things start to get a little weird, with the heavy acoustic hoedown of “Bron-Y-Aur Stomp” and the acid-fried chug of the blues standard “Shake ’em on Down”, a nod to the hypnotic one-chord version by Mississippi Fred McDowell. III has easily the best bonus material too, including a fantastic unreleased version of the old blues song “Keys to the Highway”. Depending on your age, you might remember III as “the one with the Viking kittens song” or “the one with that pretty song that played during an interlude of Almost Famous”; for someone who doesn’t necessarily want to be inundated with songs and riffs that became clichés, it might be the best place to start. For some, the interest in these sets is the remastering, an alleged improvement in sound, which makes sense for a band so song-oriented. I’ve always thought that Zeppelin, like Neil Young, were best heard from nice-sounding pressings from the ’70s that were utterly ubiquitous in used LP bins in the ’80s and ’90s. Back then, you could collect the entire Zeppelin catalog for something like $30, where the inferior sounding early CD masters would run you more like $150. These days the gap between different versions seems to be closing. I attended a listening session for these reissues in New York, hosted by Jimmy Page, and at one point he was asked which version sounded best, vinyl or CD. Page responded with saying the best version was the original analog tape, but “unfortunately I can’t invite you all ’round to listen to it.” Suffice to say that these remasters sound very good, a bit louder but not overly so, but we’re likely reaching a point of diminishing returns. That said, I’m very glad these new remasters and the attendant publicity push exist, to get us all listening to and talking about Led Zeppelin again, where they stand and what they might mean. However you feel about them and their brand of ultra-huge arena rock, there has never been another band like them, before or since.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/,"Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino",1969.0
168,Soundgarden,Superunknown,Rock,8.5,June 3 2014,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Upon its release on March 8, 1994, Superunknown wasn’t just a highly anticipated album from a critically acclaimed rock band—its multi-platinum success and Grammy wins practically felt predestined. This was Soundgarden’s long overdue turn to come out on top. Though they were the first late-’80s Seattle-scene spawn to sign to a major label, and dutifully embarked upon traditional career-building exercises like opening stadium tours for Guns N' Roses, they would be soundly leapfrogged on the charts by their Emerald City peers in Nirvana and Pearl Jam; by comparison, Soundgarden’s metallic sonatas were seemingly too knotty (and naughty) to inspire the same magnitude of crossover success. Sure, 1991’s Badmotorfinger landed a bare-chested Chris Cornell on the cover of SPIN, and an MTV ban of the allegedly blasphemous “Jesus Christ Pose” video brought the band more attention than if the station had actually aired it, but Soundgarden appeared destined to be the perennial bronze medalists in the Grunger Games. By early 1994, however, the playing field had changed considerably: Though Pearl Jam were still the most popular rock band in America, they were actively trying to be the least visible one, declaring a moratorium on videos and interviews in an orchestrated (and ultimately successful) campaign to kill their own hype. Nirvana, likewise, were in the midst of a similar retreat, and though their story had yet to reach its tragic conclusion, ominous warning signs were in the air. But as a band that enjoyed a steadier ascent than their flannelled friends—and whose records got progressively better after jumping to a major—Soundgarden didn’t seem so conflicted about success. Their response to the Seattle-scene media storm wasn’t to try to avoid it, but transcend it, and embrace the opportunity to, for a moment, become the biggest band in the land. Usually, it’s a bad sign when the wild-child frontman of your favorite group cuts his hair and starts wearing shirts. But the clean-cut Cornell that emerged with Superunknown was emblematic of the album’s mission to deliver maximal effect with minimal histrionics. With its despairing worldview, gold-plated production, and CD-stuffing 71-minute running time, Superunknown is a quintessential ’90s artifact. But thanks to its still-formidable high-wire balance of hooks and heft, the album nonetheless represents, some 20 years later, the platonic ideal of what a mainstream hard rock record should be. And even if that’s an ideal to which few contemporary bands aspire (aside from, say, Queens of the Stone Age), Superunknown remains a useful model for any left-of-center artist hoping to achieve accessibility without sacrificing identity. For Soundgarden, the push toward pop was the result of incremental evolutions rather than a spectacular leap. Where Badmotorfinger introduced flashes of psychedelia and paisley-patterned melody amid Kim Thayil’s pulverizing riffage, on Superunknown, these elements become featured attractions. The once-oblique John Lennon references gave way to unabashed homage—centerpiece power ballad “Black Hole Sun” is pretty much “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” turned upside down and dropped in a heap of soot and coal. That song counts as Superunknown’s most wanton act of subversion—setting its apocalyptic imagery to a tune so pretty, even Paul Anka can dig it—but if that element of surprise has been diluted by two decades of perpetual rock-radio rotation, the album boasts a wealth of less celebrated deep cuts (the queasy psych-folk of “Head Down,” the dread-ridden doom of “4th of July”) that retain a palpable sense of unease. Even the album’s eternal fist-pump anthems—“The Day I Tried to Live”, “Fell on Black Days”, “My Wave”—are infected with misanthropy and malaise, making Superunknown the rare arena-rock album that makes just as much sense in blacked-out bedroom. (And yet, despite the junkie intimations of its title, “Spoonman” is really just about a man who plays with spoons.) That said, if you don’t hate the world now quite as much as did when you were 18, you may find yourself skipping over the leaden likes of “Mailman” and “Limo Wreck,” while developing a newfound appreciation for how bassist Ben Shepherd’s India-inspired oddity, “Half”, injects a welcome dose of absurdity into the mix. By fortuitous coincidence, Superunknown hit stores the same day as Nine Inch Nails’ The Downward Spiral, an album boasting a similarly expansive scope and thematic framework, albeit approached from a drastically different set of influences (’80s new wave, goth, and electro as opposed to ’60s classic rock). The connection between the two albums is strong enough that the two bands toured together in 1994 and—despite some shit-talkin’ in the interim—are reuniting once again this summer for a joint-20th-anniversary jaunt. For casual Soundgarden fans who still own the record, a concert ticket may ultimately be a more efficient way of celebrating Superunknown’s birthday than by shelling out for this reissue (available in two-and five-CD box set iterations), whose bonus material mostly amounts to demos and rehearsal tapes that cast this epic album in a more normalizing light. However, you do develop a greater appreciation for the final product when you hear the ideas that got scrapped along the away or relegated to B-sides, like the dirgey embryonic arrangement of “Fell on Black Days” (a.k.a. “Black Days III”), the free-form ambient stew of “Jerry Garcia’s Finger”, and a club-friendly industrial funk mix of “Spoonman” by Steve Fisk that sounds like a test run for his beat-driven project Pigeonhed. You also get a glimpse of the band’s future course with a beautifully spare acoustic treatment of “Like Suicide” that points the way to 1996’s more temperate Down on the Upside, the album that effectively triggered Soundgarden’s subsequent 13-year break-up. But then the go-for-broke, peak-conquering triumphalism of Superunknown was itself a harbinger that the writing was on the wall for this band at the time. When Cornell sings, “Alive in the superunknown” on the album’s acid-swirled title track, it’s both a valorous testament to Soundgarden’s last-gang-in-town fortitude and a telling prophecy of the uncertainty to come, with grunge’s early ’90s stranglehold on alt-rock radio soon to be loosened by the emergence of pop-punk, Britpop, electronica, and nu-metal. But amid a musical landscape now splintered into infinite subgenres, Superunknown remains the very definition of no-qualifiers-required rock—a tombstone for a once-dominant aesthetic, perhaps, but also a solid, immovable mass that endures no matter how dramatically its surroundings have changed.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19407-soundgarden-superunknown/,"UME,UME",1994.0
169,The Roots,...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin,Rap,7.2,May 23 2014,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"""Yes, @TheRoots have NEVER been conventional in anything__--__least of all our album titles,"" Questlove tweeted wryly, announcing the Roots 11th studio album, ...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin. The way the title is worded, it could almost be the title of a ""Louie"" episode. But the phrase comes from KRS-One's ""Step Into A World"": ""MCs more worried about their financial backin'/ Steady packin' a gat as if something's gonna happen/ But it doesn't, they wind up shootin' they cousin, they buggin."" It's a joke, but a bleak, mirthless one, with nothing but dread at its core. Maybe Louis CK really could use it. Questlove has actually called this record satire, adding ""but in that satire, it's an analysis of some of the stereotypes perpetuated in not only the hip-hop community, but in the community."" He has had these things on his mind even more than usual lately; witness his series of thoughtful essays on how hip-hop ""failed Black America"" for Vulture. ""The music originally evolved to paint portraits of real people and handle real problems at close range—social contract, anyone?—but these days, hip-hop mainly rearranges symbolic freight on the black star-liner,"" he wrote. In many ways, these have been Questlove's concerns since the beginning. The Roots' late-90s high-water mark Things Fall Apart opened with sampled dialogue between Wesley Snipes and Denzel Washington from Mo' Betta Blues. ""It incenses me that own people don't realize our own heritage, our own culture—this is our music!"", says Washington.""The people don't come because you don't play the shit that they like,"" Snipes retorts. In the liner notes, Quest notes the exchange, musing ""But what if you gave people what they need? Hmm."" This basic assertion—that there is something people need from pop art that they don't know to ask for—underlines the Roots' career. It's a tricky, contentious notion, but they've always managed to tread this want/need line deftly, even as people shouted at each other over the their shoulders. Roots albums, no matter the landscape around them, always feel sturdy, firm—responsible, in the classic Gangstarr way. To paraphrase what Guru once said, they have a formula, but they update that formula. They've been representing the idea of ""Adult Hip Hop"" for a shifting demographic for 20 straight years now, and order to keep yourself at such a dignified arms'-length from the prevailing zeitgeist for that long, you actually have to have a pretty canny grasp on it. In some ways, the Roots are in middlebrow-culture heaven: They are well-supported by a cushy, high profile, well-paying TV gig, one that loosens them up to do whatever the hell they want. But they are in a weird place right now. Their last album started with a neck-kicking snare and closed with a four-movement wordless jazz suite; it sold about 35k in its first week. Around the same time, the Roots backed Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa, who played their Bruno Mars-assisted single ""Young Wild & Free"", from the execrable 2012 stoner movie Mac and Devin. The soundtrack debuted in the Top 10. …And Then You Shoot Your Cousin, then, finds the Roots in some version of the comfy purgatory they've been residing since How I Got Over. The album itself is ""uncompromising"" in the way all Roots albums have been—the sequencing is fluid and streamlined, and touches of avant-garde jazz and older forms of black pop bleed into the fabric. The mood is dour and bleak, and the rappers who assist Black Thought—Dice Raw, Greg P.O.R.N.—are full-time members of the group by now, as far as listeners are concerned. D.D. Jackson, the pianist who crafted Undun's four-movement suite, returns, and he helps whip the conclusion of ""The Coming"" into a panicked frenzy. The astringent strings swarm the song's edges like locusts clouding a window, and they are the wildest, most anarchic sound here. ""Black Rock"", which samples the same clotted, smoke-clouded rare 45 that Black Milk used on Album of the Year's ""Deadly Medley"", is one of the hardest-hitting and most baleful songs on the album. The Roots always surprise when they let their edges fray just a bit—Questlove has admitted that he enjoys the moments where he can stop ""icing out"" his technical precision and let his playing go sloppy. It's an infectious feeling you can hear spread through the entire group; ""Black Rock"" is the exact meeting point where Quest's cerebral grit meets Black Thought's all-body-blows rapping. They work beautifully this way, the group's own Lennon/McCartney, in ways that they don't when they stray into more conventional, rock-album formalist ambitions. Black Thought remains a spectacular rapper, decades into a career with plenty of invitations to burn out. He hasn't slackened an inch. His flow patterns on ""Understand"" hit like flurries of jabs to the sternum. The problem for listeners, of course, remains that he never quite knows how to stop dancing on his toes; he always sounds like he's high-stepping through a tire-field. His writing lands on a vividly sculpted image—""I was born faceless in an oasis, folks disappear here and leave no traces,"" from ""Never"", or ""I'm down to 95 dollars, that's the extent of my riches/ Out of 99 problems, 98 of them is bitches,"" from ""When the People Cheer""—just as often as it tapers off into bars and bars of stock phrases. It keeps Quest's concept-album ambitions on the frustratingly muddy side. That isn't to say there isn't plenty to think about on Cousin. But most of that thought comes from mood, arrangement, and implication. The opening track, ""Theme From Middle of the Night,"" is just that—Nina Simone, singing the luxuriously wallowing theme song for the 1959 film. Mary Lou Williams' gothic, frightening ""The Devil"" gets sampled for a 40-second snippet that cuts off on the baleful warning ""The Devil looks a lot like you and I."" The song leads directly into ""Black Rock"", the two voices carefully lined up to feel like a direct continuation of each other. There is a squalling burst of musique concrète in ""Dies Arae"", which erupts with Scott Walker fierceness out of the blank space and marauds through the mix for a minute. The album feels haunted, even plagued, by other voices and memories. And, of course, the records sounds spectacular. Black Thought's voice sounds raspier and more guttural the older he gets. The snares on ""The Dark (Trinity) feel like fingers flicking your ear drums. The Roots have gotten very proficient at making Roots albums. But the hooks on ""Never"", ""When the People Cheer"", and ""The Coming""—sung by Patty Crash, Modesty Lycan, and Mercedes Martinez, respectively—are somewhat flat and generic-sounding. And the songs themselves rely on a Roots template that feels a little too well-worn to generate much friction anymore—midtempo, muted, built around a minor-key piano line and heavy with intimations of doom. It's in those moments, the comfortable, careful ones, that you wonder how closely the Roots examine the symbolic freight aboard their own vessel, how far they would be interested in shaking themselves up.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19332-the-roots-and-then-you-shoot-your-cousin/,Def Jam,2014.0
170,Mac Miller,Faces,Rap,7.3,May 22 2014,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"On last year’s Watching Movies with the Sound Off, Mac Miller earned an elusive measure of cachet among rap diehards by burrowing into his record collection and trying on the irreverent frenzy of Odd Future, the offbeat whimsy of MF Doom, and the gonzo electronics of the Brainfeeder squad. He ended up with the best work of his young career, a satisfying leap from the bushy-tailed, eager-to-please kid brother raps of his early work towards tighter rhymes fixated in a knottier headspace. Mac has since worked tirelessly to prove Watching Movies’ gains were no fluke, showcasing his range on a series of off-the-cuff side projects: Delusional Thomas featured an impishly pitched-up Mac cutting loose on a half-hour mixtape of gutbucket murder raps, while Live from Space documented the plush sonics of Miller’s summer 2013 Space Migration Tour, which fleshed out Watching Movies’ spacier cuts with the help of Syd tha Kid and Matt Martians’ project the Internet. Odd Future associate Vince Staples’ Stolen Youth featured Mac in the producer’s chair unfurling hypnotic soundscapes under his Larry Fisherman pseudonym. Mac Miller’s most ambitious post-Watching Movies project arrived in the form of a Mother’s Day mixtape called Faces, which advances on his last LP's heady sprawl with a palette stretching from rainy day introspection to playful wordplay exercises. Where Watching Movies was equally concerned with refining his writing skills and presenting a personality you wouldn’t mind sparking up a j with, this mixtape prizes frankness over curation. On cuts like opener “Inside Outside” and “Here We Go”, the latter in which Mac pridefully scans his growing empire and notes that he “did it all without a Drake feature”, the joy is infectious. Mac gets downcast for the midsection body shot combo of “Happy Birthday”, “Wedding”, and “Funeral”, a passage that moves seamlessly from excitement to fear and uncertainty (“Do you ever reach to touch her, but there’s nothing there?/ Do you tell her that you love her, but she doesn’t care?”) into despair (“Doing drugs is just a war with boredom, but they’re sure to get me”). Faces goes where Watching Movies wouldn’t, picking over the fallout from a teen rap sensation suddenly becoming nouveau riche. Much of the time, that means picking apart Mac’s infatuation with drugs. Hard partying bleeds into unexpected corners of the proceedings, from the debit card covered in “snowflakes” on “Friends” to the cautionary PCP comedown tale of “Angel Dust”. Miller catalogues reckless substance use like a news anchor would a traffic jam: he matter-of-factly calls himself a “drug absorbent endorphin addict” with a “drug habit like Philip Hoffman” on “What Do You Do?”, and even “Therapy”’s lightweight account of a night out with a girl contains a bout of self-medication. “Malibu” warns that “The good times can be a trap” and toys with the idea of checking into rehab before resolving to just save the remainder of the coke for another day. There's a troubling sense that Mac is tiptoeing down a well-lit path toward self-destruction and that he either feels too helpless or else too enrapt to change course , but if Faces’ good-times-are-killing-me terrors seem overbearing, they’re often offset by a sense that music is his salvation. On the technical end, Faces is Mac Miller’s high watermark. The wordplay is limber and odd, as flows shift mid-verse and imbue otherwise nonsensical turns of phrase with jerky life. It’s enough to make unrepentantly dark lines lively. When “Polo Jeans” opens with “I give no fucks when I go nuts cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead/ Woke up from the coma, pulled up in a Škoda, smoked, went back to bed” you’re more likely to run it back for the deft internal rhymes than the plot point about a potential overdose. Miller’s finally able to play ball with his esteemed rap friends, too; where he once played outfield for guys like Earl Sweatshirt and Staples, here he’s matching them bar for bar. By the time Rick Ross shows up for verse three of “Insomniak”, Mac’s already run the beat ragged. Miller’s advances as a self-taught auteur also extend to production: he crafted the majority of the beats here, and he’s arrived at an unfussed, sample-based melodicism that both harkens back to the jazzy boom bap of the 75 Ark and Fondle ‘Em Records era and stays the hell out of the way of the raps. Faces finds Mac Miller embracing a typical 2010s rapper trope: the exploratory between-album mixtape. Its 24 tracks run nearly an hour and a half, each restlessly tinkering with his songwriting and production talents. The sprawl gives Faces a directionless feel, so it’s doubtful you’ll ever play it all in one sitting—regardless, the kid’s turning out the best work of his career, transforming adversity and discouragement into intriguing art. It might seem daunting, drug-crazed and unwieldy at the outset, but given the proper time and patience, the mixtape proves to be Mac’s most consistently honest and personal work to date. Early on “Here We Go” advises that he “ain’t little Malcolm with the baby face” anymore, and whatever memory of that goofy, affable kid remains, Faces is its slow and methodical death and dismemberment.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19390-mac-miller-faces/,Self-released,2014.0
171,Sturgill Simpson,Metamodern Sounds in Country Music,Folk/Country,7.7,May 16 2014,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Sturgill Simpson saw Jesus juggle flames and met the devil in Seattle, or so he sings on “Turtles All the Way Down”, the opening track on his second solo album. Just when you think he’s slinging the same Biblical imagery Johnny Cash foretold on “The Man Comes Around”, Simpson adds that he “Met Buddha yet another time/ And he showed me a glowing light within.” Rather than parrot the same Christian ideology that most country musicians consider integral to the genre, this Kentucky-born singer-songwriter is a quester, intrigued by the metaphysics of spiritual experience and wondering aloud if the Bible and a handful of 'shrooms will lead you to the same religious epiphany. This isn’t country music to put on when you want to stare at your hand for three hours—well, it is, but it’s more than that. Simpson’s true subject isn’t the “reptile aliens made of light” who “cut you open and pull out all your pain,” although that’s a great line for a country song. Instead, he’s much more preoccupied on “Turtles” and throughout the nine songs that follow, with a much more earthly and everyday emotion: “Love’s the only thing that ever saved my life.” Perhaps it’s because his steely voice turns surprisingly tender when he sings that line, or perhaps because his Mellotron player provides a bed of strings as nebulous as the Milky Way—but somehow Simpson pulls it off without sounding pretentious, schmaltzy, or dangerous. With a sharp mind to match that Hag burr of a voice, Simpson not only owns the best name in current country music but comprehends the genre as a vehicle for big, unwieldy ideas about human consciousness and the nature of life. He got Pope portraitist Jason Seiler to do the cover art, and Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are thanked in the liner notes. Nashville rarely sounds so trippy as it does on Metamodern Sounds in Country Music, whose title alludes to Ray Charles by way of Seth Abramson. It’s heady stuff, and potentially insufferable, too, if Simpson wasn’t able to keep everything down to earth. He favors clear melodies, careful structures, and riffs that draw on Nashville and Bakersfield traditions without sounding revivalist. Nothing else on Metamodern is quite so bold or quite so dense as “Turtles All the Way Down”, but Simpson comes across as a man deeply dissatisfied with the easy answers country music typically passes along as wisdom. As “Long White Line” dissipates into a blast of spacey distortion, Laur Joamets’ slide guitar sounds like a spacecraft taking off, but the song itself is tightly structured and moored to some dusty honkytonk on Planet Earth. Only on the penultimate track does he really blast into the cosmos: “It Ain’t All Flowers” begins as a stark self-reckoning at the bathroom mirror, then dissolves into a bizarre sci-fi jam full of backwards guitars, parallel-universe synths, and fragmented drum beats. Immediately after that song fades, Simpson launches into the hidden bonus track, “Pan Bowl”, which drops us back in some remote Kentucky holler. It’s the most traditionally nostalgic moment on Metamodern Sounds, full of soft-focus memories of four generations of Simpsons, and the acoustic austerity only underscores sharpness of the songcraft and the vividness of the details. He may be a big thinker, but when it comes to the primacy of the song in country music, Simpson is a traditionalist. There are no extraneous sounds or ideas here, nothing that’s not battened down to a carefully structured set of lyrics and melodies. As a result, the best moment here may be the most unlikely: a cover of the 1988 post-New Wave hit “The Promise” by When in Rome. Simpson slows it down to a crawl, yet this isn’t one of those reinterpretations that purports to find deeper meaning through a more tasteful “Mad World” reimagining. The melody is tricky, especially divorced from that familiar piano line, but Simpson delivers it with gentle stalwartness, testifying powerfully to the magnitude of love. The Mellotron string section swoops in to add some earthly drama to an emotion that might just explain the entire universe.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19386-sturgill-simpson-metamodern-sounds-in-country-music/,High Top Mountain,2014.0
172,Michael Jackson,Xscape,Pop/R&B,4.1,May 15 2014,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"Michael Jackson has released more new music in the five years since his death than in the 12 years before it. Jackson was a perfectionist about his music, and he recorded many more songs than he ever released. That means that there's a lot of unreleased material in his archives; Michael appeared in 2010, and now we've got this strange, underfed, vaguely horrid eight-song record, inexplicably named after the group that had a hit with ""Just Kickin' It"". It's a set of outtakes and misfires that Jackson recorded in the 20th century, freshly ""re-produced"" by L.A. Reid, Timbaland, and others to sound as if he'd just shown up to make a new record in a contemporary style. That, it should be noted, is a trick that's been tried before with Jackson's music. When Motown overdubbed and remixed some of his decade-old factory seconds in 1984, it yielded the Farewell My Summer Love album, whose packaging briefly fooled a few people into thinking it was the follow-up to Thriller. It's true that the new versions sound more modern and souped-up than the originals (which you also get if you buy the ""deluxe edition"" of Xscape), but their producers don't have enough distance from Jackson's presence to reframe his voice the way that, say, Junkie XL's remix of ""A Little Less Conversation"" reframed Elvis Presley's. It doesn't help that the outtakes they're dealing with are several tiers below the stuff that ended up on Jackson's later albums—maybe the estate is trying to parcel out the best material over time, maybe it doesn't get any better than this. ""A Place with No Name"" is Jackson's rewrite of America's two-chord wonder ""A Horse with No Name"", which is a bad enough idea on its own; Stargate, who produced the new version, replace the signature guitar riff with a sugary electroswing arrangement, but it doesn't help. Most of these tracks are Jackson hiccuping and eee-hee-ing on autopilot through underdeveloped semi-tunes; both Grace Jones and MC Lyte beat him to the title ""Slave to the Rhythm"" with much better songs. (The version here is not the one with Justin Bieber that leaked a while back.) Jackson liked to present himself as pop's eternally youthful Peter Pan. In truth, he was more its Rabbit Angstrom, forever re-enacting his moment of moonwalking glory from a position of ever-increasing bitterness. Defensive, brittle songs like Xscape's title track (""don't you try to tell me what is right for me!"") don't look good on anyone. The most embarrassing song here, though, is ""Do You Know Where Your Children Are"", a Dangerous outtake that apparently never got finished. (If Jackson knew what the bridge's lyrics were going to be, he wasn't letting on in the recording studio.) It's a finger-jabbing harangue about a 12-year-old runaway who's ""tired of stepdaddy using her/ Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her"" and ends up hooking on Sunset Boulevard. As courageously stand-taking as it was for Jackson to indicate that he opposed child abuse, it might not have been wise for his estate to release a song in which he's getting all sanctimonious about that particular topic. (The shred-by-numbers guitar solo that ends the new version doesn't do the song any favors either.) The one keeper on Xscape is its opener, ""Love Never Felt So Good"", which is also its oldest song—it dates from 1983 or so—and the one that's been in circulation the longest: written by Jackson and Paul Anka, it initially surfaced on a 1984 Johnny Mathis album. It's got the best Jackson vocal here, too. The original take, which is mostly just his voice, fingersnaps and a piano, showcases the kind of  gravity-defying singing-for-pleasure that we barely heard from him in the post-Thriller era. The deluxe version of Xscape appends a Timbaland-produced remix of ""Love Never Felt So Good"" on which Justin Timberlake sings along with the old tape, featuring disco flourishes borrowed from Jackson's ""Working Day and Night"". It sounds pleasantly like an echo of good Michael Jackson, but the fact that sampling an even earlier Jackson song makes it sound more contemporary says something about how wrongheaded this entire project is.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19333-michael-jackson-xscape/,Epic,2014.0
173,The Black Keys,Turn Blue,Rock,5.8,May 13 2014,Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,"This may be a weird statement to make about one of North America's most popular rock bands, but the Black Keys are survivors. The majority of the duo's colleagues from the early 2000s have since called it quits, but the workmanlike Akron boys Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney kept their heads down, dutifully churning out gutshot blues-pop mimicry that carried just enough of a punch to establish them as, at the least, a reliable stadium-act opening band. Then: worldwide financial turmoil struck, the buying public went from purchasing few records to no records at all, dance music infiltrated pop's consciousness, and guitars were, prophetically, exchanged for turntables (or, in keeping with recent trends, MPCs). Banjo-players and Dave Grohl formed an unlikely alliance to establish ""real music"" as 2010s mainstream rock culture's slyly conservative ethos and just like that, the Black Keys emerged as the most popular guys making music that sounds like older music without getting all P.T. Barnum about it. Brothers from 2010 (the first record made at Muscle Shoals in three decades, natch) was the Keys' most consciously bloated effort and, paradoxically, the one that placed them firmly in their current position of The Only Band Your Friend From High School Listens to These Days; writing their catchiest song to date, ""Tighten Up"", helped, as did soundtracking every goddamn car commercial and buddy-comedy movie trailer that didn't have breakdancing hamsters in it. Cementing their rep as canny opportunists, Carney and Auerbach returned a year later with El Camino, a sleazy, hook-laden album that switched between the basic thematic food groups of cars-and-women and cars-as-women with the horndog exuberance of a kid doing donuts on an ATV in an abandoned dirt lot. El Camino was the best ZZ Top album that you can't stream on Spotify and, in an impressive feat for a band so 9-to-5 about their creative process that they once recorded an album in an actual factory, it also turned out to be their most distinctive work and arguably their best. The Black Keys' eighth album and first in three years isn't their worst effort—that distinction still belongs to 2006's Magic Potion, their paste-bland major-label debut—but after the relatively fresh approach on El Camino, it's dismaying how much of the inert, mid-tempo Turn Blue resembles elements of their previous albums: Brothers' stoner-friendly drift, Attack & Release's toy-xylophone psychedelia, Magic Potion's indifferent blare. After a decade-plus of pilfering musical history with all the subtlety of a brick through a windshield—for Christ's sake, last time around they basically plagiarized ""Last Dance With Mary Jane""—the Black Keys' cultural cannibalism has finally turned inward. Turn Blue finds the Black Keys getting deep with themselves in several ways; Auerbach recently told Rolling Stone that the band set out to make a singles-bereft ""Headphone[s] record,"" and he's alluded elsewhere that his messy, allegation-laden divorce proceedings—which, in a this-joke-writes-itself touch, once was believed to include a lock of Bob Dylan's hair—lent the album a ""melancholy"" vibe. Appropriately, Turn Blue sounds distant and subdued, a murky-sounding collection of '70s stoner-rock facsimiles and swirling gray tones that, for the most part, are indistinguishable. Lyrically, the Black Keys' casual chauvinism has gone from ""Girl, you look so good"" to ""Woman, you done me wrong,"" the shift in mindset undeniably affected by Auerbach's personal troubles. ""Why you always wanna love the ones who hurt you,"" he sings over the sluggish bounce of ""Year in Review"", ""Then break down when they go and deserve you."" Allusions to rain, running, sickness, and the open road are predictably expressed, and Auerbach admits on the title track's disco-ball lilt: ""In the dead of the night/ I start to lose control."" The couplet speaks volumes, as the mushy gruel of Turn Blue represents the sound of a band going so deep into their own heads that they lose track of where the exit doors are located. It's tempting once again to blame the dullness on Brian ""Danger Mouse"" Burton, a sometimes-capable producer whose reputation in recent years has carried the weight of an ""Out of Order"" sign on a bathroom door. Indeed, Burton's reign of boredom continues here in typical fashion; his love for airlock-hatch atmospherics and stiff string-section motifs are intact, and even without the credits confirming it, you could probably guess that the orchestral touches of ""Year in Review"" were lifted from the score for an Italian 1970s sex comedy. If Burton remains an easy scapegoat, this time it's harder to make the charges stick. Turn Blue is the second consecutive Black Keys album where he's credited as a contributing songwriter, and as the veritable third Black Key since Attack & Release, his presence has led to some of the band's most successful, purposefully forceful music. The Black Keys are, in fact, the one band this decade that Burton has collaborated with effectively, so the failures of Turn Blue come across mostly as a byproduct of an imbalance of power. While the suffocating weightlessness of the LP's first third is enough to give anyone who's listened to a Broken Bells record more than once a serious case of PTSD, Carney and Auerbach sound as if they're holding back in response, succumbing to bland choruses and muddy aimlessness despite the fact that their catalog dictates they're capable of much more than this. Throughout Turn Blue, it's difficult to tell how invested these guys actually are in the music they're making, an indifferent attitude that encourages the listener to act in tandem. The Black Keys have never been known for innovation—we're talking about a band that covered the fucking Beatles on their first album—but Turn Blue's strongest moments happen when they explore new territory. At nearly seven minutes, opener ""Weight of Love"" is a moody epic that carries melodic hints of the pleasantly stretched-out ""Bullet in the Brain"", meandering to a searing guitar solo that, for those with heavy investment in searing guitar solos, should more than suffice. Lead single ""Fever"", meanwhile, is Turn Blue's Festival-Headliner Hit, its subtly catchy hook and farty keyboard sounds resembling what might happen if MGMT-circa-2014 tried to write something approaching ""Electric Feel"" in terms of weirded-out pop accessibility. Turn Blue's most surprising moment arrives at the end: ""Gotta Get Away"", whose title alone suggests that the Black Keys are ready to move on from this uncharacteristically dour fog they're trapped in. Coming off as the strongest classic-rock beer-commercial jam since Kid Rock's cliché-tastic ""All Summer Long"", the cowboy-boots guitar riff and Auerbach's unchained vocal take pair perfectly to create the album's most energizing blast-in-a-glass cut, to the point where it's hard not to dream of an entire album of songs like this. The song sounds like summer; with the right sync, ""Gotta Get Away"" could make millionaires out of anyone who sells rubber tires and rope. ""For no one/ It's no fun, no fun/ With a one track mind,"" Auerbach sings on the tune, after name-checking Kalamazoo and wondering where all the ""good women"" have gone in typical dirtbag fashion; it's hard not to read his lyrical admission as anything but self-prescriptive. On a record where the Black Keys' try way too hard to be ""weird,"" ""Gotta Get Away"" is the sole moment where they get out of their own heads and back into that beat-up van. You can't fault them for trying to get deep, but this is one band for which shallowness is a virtue.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19329-the-black-keys-turn-blue/,Nonesuch,2014.0
174,Grace Jones,Nightclubbing,"Electronic,Rock",9.0,May 1 2014,Andy Beta,Contributor,"Like Josephine Baker nearly 50 years before her, it was when Jamaican-born Grace Jones left New York City and went to Paris in 1970 that she went from being mere Wilhelmina Agency model to international cause célèbre. Towering at nearly six feet, with an obsidian skin tone and facial features like flint rather than flesh, Grace Jones and her androgynous looks made her a sensation in the fashion world. She stalked the runways for Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo Takada, roomed with Jessica Lange and Jerry Hall, served as muse for photographers like Helmut Newton and appeared on the covers of Elle and Vogue. Fashion world conquered, Jones then returned to NYC, habituated Studio 54 (sometimes in nothing more than her birthday suit), and conquered disco, recording three albums with the man who invented the very notion of the form, Tom Moulton. Jones’ choice of covers on those albums ran the gamut from dreck like “Send in the Clowns” to a stunning rendition of Edith Piaf’s “La Vie En Rose,” her flat monotone speak-singing voice atop a flamboyant overly-dramatic backdrop that veered often into camp. When the disco backlash began in earnest, Jones set her sights on a new realm to conquer: new wave. In 1980, Grace Jones decamped to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas where she worked with producers Alex Sadkin and Island Records’ president Chris Blackwell, as well as a crack team of session musicians rooted by the rhythmic reggae force of Sly & Robbie. (This group would eventually be dubbed Compass Point All Stars, supplying island grooves for everyone from Robert Palmer to Tom Tom Club to Black Uhuru.) Across three critical and commercial hit albums spanning from 1980’s Warm Leatherette through 1982’s Living My Life --with the expanded reissue of 1981’s Nightclubbing as her pinnacle-- Jones reinvented herself, while also altering the face of modern pop. Fashion, art, and music all converged in the form of Mrs. Jones and looking out at the 21st century musical landscape, it’s easy to see her influence: Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A., Grimes, FKA twigs, and more. Beyond that, there’s an entire subset of alternative music that draws on the template set by Jones and her Nassau backing band: Massive Attack, Todd Terje, Gorillaz, Hot Chip, and LCD Soundsystem all emulate those rubbery yet taut grooves of Sly & Robbie and cohorts, a hybrid that amalgamated rock, funk, post-punk, pop and reggae. So curiously strong was Grace Jones’s influence on pop culture of the early '80s that not only did she pioneer the androgynous look in fashion (as styled by Jones’s then-beau Jean-Paul Goude), she was even able to turn her chiseled bodyguard boy toy into an action star. It's but one of many examples of Jones' singular existence in pop culture (who else nearing retirement age could command a stage with the likes of both Lil’ Kim and Luciano Pavarotti, or perform for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee while hula-hooping?). On the album’s opener, a cover of Flash and the Pan’s “Walking in the Rain”, Jones growls in her contralto about “Feeling like a woman/ Looking like a man.” Noirish, foreboding, sounding rain-slicked, the beat crafted by Sly Dunbar with percussionist Uzziah (Sticky) Thompson is undeniable across its four minutes. But it’s on the second disc, where many of the album tracks' running times are extended towards the sublime, that the now seven-minute song soars even higher. It also doubles as a showcase for keyboard wizard and the Nassau band’s secret weapon, Wally Badarou, a classically-trained synth session man who’s C.V. includes M’s “Pop Music” and Level 42’s “Something About You.” Badarou's extended solo evokes a tone not unlike Miles Davis' muted trumpet: gorgeous, weightless, it's as brooding and wistful as a midnight walk in the rain can be. On Grace Jones’s take on the tango “I’ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango),” Badarou mimics both Argentinean tango master Astor Piazzolla’s bandoneon and that eerie organ tone of “Runaway”. But of course, Grace Jones is the star here. Five of the original album’s nine songs are covers, though rather than fealty to the source material, Jones sounds as if she’s shredding the songbook with her bare teeth. She treats each cover not as a singer tackling a song, but as an actor inhabiting the skin of a role. She sneers the Police’s “Demolition Man” as if she's a villainess leveling a hospital, inverting the gender and notions of sexual dominance in her lascivious take on Bill Withers’ “Use Me.” Dubbing out the zombiefied pacing of “Nightclubbing”, Jones intones Iggy Pop’s lines with the detachment of a dominatrix contemplating her cat o’nine tails, while a previously unreleased cover of Tubeway Army’s “Me! I Disconnect From You” sets it in a sleek reggae setting. Another bonus track is labeled “Peanut Butter,” which some disco fans will recognize as the title of another Sly & Robbie & Wally track (as remixed by Larry Levan), made for Gwen Guthrie on her 1985 mini-album Padlock. But here, “Peanut Butter” is the beat that Grace Jones turned into her Top 10 single and Paradise Garage anthem, “Pull Up to the Bumper.” Originally deemed “too R&B” by Chris Blackwell, Jones finally got her hands on the pistoning riddim and turned it into one of the most profane singles in pop/dance music history. Long black limousines, commands to “pull up” and coos of “let me lubricate it” make it one of the finest parallel parking metaphors for butt-fucking. At a time wherein a song about a ""gigantic"" interracial lover can soundtrack a tech giant's new promotional ad campaign, one hopes that soon a car company will do the same for Grace Jones' most wanton pop moment on a record that further cemented her iconic status in pop culture.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19222-grace-jones-nightclubbing-deluxe-edition/,"Island,Island",1981.0
175,Mobb Deep,The Infamous,Rap,10.0,April 9 2014,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"The foreboding, faraway skree announcing Mobb Deep's ""Shook Ones Pt. II"" is one of rap's most perfect sounds—but what is it? It might be a horn. But it also might be an exploding steam pipe, or a car alarm, or a laser-jet printer. An even stranger sound follows it: four notes played on either a guitar imitating a piano or a piano imitating a guitar. The line is so disorienting that it inspired a sixteen-year long hunt for its source, which only ended in 2011 when producer Havoc confessed that sample snitches had finally pinpointed their target – a three-second piece of a Herbie Hancock instrumental, sped up and then slowed down. Playing the sample back to back with its source does absolutely nothing to resolve the mystery of ""Shook Ones Pt II."" For the kids who made it—Albert ""Prodigy"" Johnson, from Hempstead, and Kejuan ""Havoc"" Muchita, from Queensbridge—""Shook Ones Pt. II"" was half war cry, half last gasp. It announced The Infamous, Mobb Deep's second album and their first classic, and in the canon of career-revitalizing rap singles—Kool Moe Dee's ""How Ya Like Me Now"", LL Cool J's ""Mama Said Knock You Out"", Dre's ""Still D.R.E.""—""Shook Ones Pt. II"" is maybe the most effective, and certainly the most devastating.  The song was a rebirth, and the album that it foreshadowed would rewrite their legacy entirely. The Infamous was not supposed to happen. Johnson and Muchita had already gotten their shot, releasing a corny, forgettable debut called Juvenile Hell in 1993 that sold 20,000 copies before being dwarfed by Illmatic, which had already traveled the world as a demo before its official release in April of '94. At every radio interview, Havoc and P found themselves answering questions about Havoc's Queensbridge neighbor Nas. In his 2011 memoir My Infamous Life, Prodigy recalls ""Halftime"" pumping out of the speakers at what was supposed to be a Mobb Deep in-store in D.C. Shortly afterward, Mobb Deep were dropped from their label. They retreated, licking their wounds, to Havoc's mother's house. In New York, things were getting increasingly serious–Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), also released in '93, had already shipped platinum by May of '94. A revolution was brewing in their own city, and the authors of puerile kiddie sex raps like ""Hit it From the Back"" were in danger of getting left behind forever. It was out of this brew of desperation and determination that The Infamous began to take shape. Their music took on a grimmer, darker tone. A few key people took notice. One was Schott Free, an A&R at Loud Records and former member of the short-lived rap group Legion of D.U.M.E.; another was Matteo ""Matty C"" Capoluongo, who ran The Source's News section and wrote its venerated Unsigned Hype column. Capoluongo and Free occasionally worked together on behalf raw, roughneck rap, the kind of stuff the industry required occasional nudging to embrace. It was Jacobs, for instance, who initially brought Wu-Tang's ""Protect Ya Neck"" into The Source offices. He and Matty C slipped Mobb Deep's new single, the fierce and focused ""Patty Shop"", to influential DJs Stretch and Bobbito. Word spread, albeit faintly, that the duo might yet have new life in them. The third important figure behind The Infamous is Q-Tip, whose bemused presence floats over Mobb Deep's early career. When they were still teenagers hungry for a record deal, Havoc and Prodigy accosted Tip outside of the Def Jam offices. He obligingly ushered the duo into the hallowed offices of Lyor Cohen, whereupon they rewarded him by accidentally shooting a Def Jam employee in the stomach. He didn't give up on them, however, and on The Infamous, he does enough work to qualify as a temporary third member—co-producing and rapping on two songs (""Give Up The Goods"" and ""Drink Away The Pain"") and working with Havoc to refine and perfect the album's indelible atmosphere. It is that atmosphere that lingers, untouched and intact, now that Havoc and Prodigy are reissuing the album via a PledgeMusic-funded project. In addition to the original album, they are including a disc of rare and unreleased tracks from the sessions along with a full new album, confusingly, also called The Infamous Mobb Deep. The branding is odd, and the timing for the project feels a little off: For one, they are claiming a 20th-anniversary celebration for The Infamous a full year ahead of schedule. For another, the duo recently suffered through a highly publicized, and extremely ugly, split while Prodigy was in prison. Maybe the reissue functions as a renewal of the vows between the two, a way to patch up relations while reminding rap fans, and themselves, of the potential power of a flagging, listless brand. The reissue, if nothing else, is a helpful reminder that this power is still there, for whoever wants it. The reason The Infamous remains so untouchable today goes beyond its individual qualities —the vividness of Prodigy's imagery, or the richness of the Queensbridge slang they introduced —into more rarefied air. With The Infamous, Mobb Deep invented a feeling, one that was more important than any individual word, chorus, or rhyme.  All of New York was embracing degraded production at the time, but Havoc pushed beyond the  low-resolution samples of RZA's Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) into near-total abstraction, producing a masterpiece of low, muffled, and malevolent sounds. The stand-up bass sample on ""Trife Life"" sounds like it has cotton balls behind the strings. The implication of vinyl crackle in ""Eye for An Eye"" feels like a needle dragging on tendons.  ""Q.U. -- Hectic,""  boasts a glowing, pulsing piano echo that feels nearly sentient, like some kind of slit-eyed pet monster Havoc is resting one hand on to keep calm. Throughout, Havoc and Prodigy exude the confidence and comfort of artists who have found their voice and their ideal environment, and can break whatever rules they want. If they want to interrupt their album after one song in so Prodigy can deliver an Henny-soaked rant promising to punch other rappers in the face ""just for living?"" They'll do that (""The Infamous Prelude"").  If Q-Tip wants to drop into ""Drink Away The Pain,"" a tightly themed song about alcoholism, to rap only about his clothes—he'll do that. Nothing disturbs the surface. Every decision feels seamless and inevitable within the bubble Havoc and P.  created. There is a wholeness, an impenetrable circularity, to The Infamous as a result. Havoc, who grew up in Queensbridge, taught Prodigy how to rap in the secret-handshake style of his projects, while Prodigy, whose grandparents were jazz royalty, taught Havoc how to use studio equipment. In each case, the student became more adept than the teacher, and the result is a seamless cohesion, Havoc and Prodigy representing two halves of an endlessly repeating thought. Sounds repeat themselves like distant lights, or recurring nightmares, blurring your sense of the album's progression: That unforgettable ""skree"" from ""Shook Ones"" reappears on the chorus of ""Q.U. – Hectic."" With apologies to Nic Pizzolatto, there is a distinct ""This has all happened before, and will happen again"" air of fatalism to The Infamous. And while gangsta rap had been fatalistic before 1995, it had never sounded quite this fatalistic. Appropriately, The Infamous also marked the moment that the language in gangsta rap shifted from corner scrambles and specific vendettas to all-out war, endless and impersonal.  ""Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted/ So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it,"" Prodigy raps on ""Trife Life"". He's not targeting anyone in particular--just ""the enemy."" This was the logical conclusion to the lyrical (and literal) arms race in mid-90s gangsta rap; Mobb Deep got all the way to the end first, and said everything best. The album's most famous and oft-quoted lyrics remain ""There's a war going on outside no man is safe from,"" from ""Survival of the Fittest"", but Havoc's ""Q.U.--Hectic"" line ""Real like an innocent child that turned killer"" tells it just as well: From here on out, this would the only kind of reality Havoc and P would explore, or acknowledge. That worldview is what's missing on The Infamous Mobb Deep. Or, if it’s there, it comes through crackly and unreliable, like a radio station just out of range. As a Mobb Deep project, it's mortifyingly weak—before 2006's Blood Money, the duo had never made a bad album, and Blood Money was bad precisely because it wasn't a proper Mobb Deep album, but rather a fourth-rate G-Unit record with Havoc and Prodigy rapping listlessly on it. This time, they have no one to blame but themselves. Their lack of investment is audible on every level: The beats feels tinny and wheezy, and the album hardly sounds mastered, full of clippy snares and poorly synced vocals. The beat on ""Get Down"" is barely audible. The hooks are just flat chants with no rhythm or life in them. The chemistry between the two, more troublingly, is nowhere in sight. Prodigy has receded further and further into idiosyncrasy as a solo artist, to the point where it's difficult to imagine him belonging to a group at all. He doesn't even offer any of his choice ""HOW I FOLD MY BANDANA"" weirdness: ""I flood the cold streets with your hot blood"", from ""Taking You Off Here"", is about as hard as he tries, as far as imagery or wordplay or contrast goes. He can still summon vivid, bone-chilling imagery, and was doing so as recently as his Bumpy Johnson EP. But he barely shrugs his way through The Infamous Mobb Deep. Taken as a whole, the album is exactly the sort of hastily tossed-off, forgettable project that legacy acts will sometimes tack onto can't-miss releases such as this. It's a shame they did. The disc of rare and unreleased tracks from the 1994 The Infamous sessions, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that reissues are made for. Many of these songs have been available to hardcore rap fans for years, but the best of them, like “Take It In Blood” and “Gimme The Goods”, are the equal of anything that made The Infamous. They extend the album’s long shadow and give a fuller picture of Mobb’s startling leap in confidence from Juvenile Hell to Infamous. There are a couple fan Easter Eggs here too, the most notable of which is the “lost reel” early version of their Raekwon/Nas collaboration ""Eye For An Eye"" with an alternate Nas verse and a vintage Ghost verse. But my favorite moment might be the mind-bending live freestyle session between Mobb Deep, Raekwon, and Nas. Rae spits a verse that would end up on “Incarcerated Scarfaces”; Nas follows up. Both of them, however, quiet down when Havoc and P start rapping. The duo are still in complete, blissful sync, their voices young but old-sounding, their newfound chemistry a thing  to behold. Apart from murmuring some appreciative noises, Rae and Nas are reverently silent. You realize, with some amazement, that they just feel lucky to be in the room.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19240-mobb-deep-the-infamous-the-infamous-mobb-deep/,"Self-released,Self-released,Self-released",1995.0
176,Miles Davis,Miles at the Fillmore - Miles Davis 1970: The Bootleg Series Vol. 3,Jazz,8.8,March 31 2014,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Miles Davis hated stasis. In the 30-year period between the time he first gained notice playing bebop with Charlie Parker to when he retired for five years in 1975, his music was usually in a state of transformation, with steady but noticeable changes occasionally interrupted by moments of what, in another context, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called “punctuated equilibrium.” The shifts were not linear and could never be understood in terms of “progression.” Explorations into impressionist harmony, modal improvisation, pastoral sound-painting, neoclassical orchestration, abstract funk, and sheets of electronic noise weren’t experienced as one music building on top of another, but rather a constant search for the possibilities lurking in the unknown. As the years wore on, Miles’ own fear of irrelevance kept him working with players many years younger than himself so he was being exposed to new ideas without feeling the need to chase trends (most major jazz figures with an interest in experimentation made some overtures toward free jazz in the 1960s but Miles never did). All of which is to say that when you contemplate a single, narrow segment of Miles’ brilliant and varied career, there’s no telling what the music is going to give you until you immerse yourself in it. You have to look at where it came from and where it would go next. Miles at the Fillmore, the latest entry in Columbia’s revelatory bootleg series collecting unreleased Miles Davis live material, finds the trumpeter departing one musical world and entering a new one. In the previous five years, he’d taken the music of the Second Great Quintet (Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams) as far as it could go; hearing new music in his head, music that had never been made before, Miles fully embraced electric instruments on the dual landmarks In a Silent Way and, a year later, in April 1970, Bitches Brew; most of this set was recorded in June of that year. By this point in a very busy year of live performances, Bitches Brew was in stores and selling well and making waves, and Miles and his band were playing large rock venues, landing on the same bills as the Grateful Dead and Neil Young. Some of this material has been released in a different form. These four discs each contain an evening’s set, recorded on four consecutive nights in New York at the Fillmore East (live albums during this time can get confusing—Miles also recorded in April 1970 at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and some of that material, in far poorer sound quality, is included as bonus tracks). On the 1970 2xLP Miles Davis at Fillmore, each night was condensed and edited by Teo Macero into an approximately 25-minute collage to fit a single album side and given an overarching title without identifying individual pieces (“Wednesday Miles”, “Thursday Miles”, etc.) That decision foreshadowed what was to come with Miles’ live sets through the rest of the 1970s, as written compositions and themes were considered only as additional elements to be swirled into process-oriented whole, and needn’t necessarily be identified. Compared to where his music would take in the ensuing four years, Miles’ sound in mid–1970 was still loosely tethered to jazz tradition. There are distinct compositions that unfold with a set arc, there are recognizable themes, there’s still a standard in regular rotation. And unlike his music in 1974 and ’75, Miles Davis’ trumpet is very much the focus, and his tone was strong and forceful and could easily cut through the electronic din. There are two keyboard players here, both of whom would go on to become hugely popular in the 1970s: Keith Jarrett (organ) and Chick Corea (electric piano). With no guitarist in the band, Jarrett and Corea are responsible for the electronics, and each plays his instrument in ways that go well beyond its intended use; Jarrett’s squawking solos are often harsh and noisy, reminiscent of electric guitar, while Corea’s electric piano gives the music a sense of disembodied drift. Dave Holland’s basslines are simple ostinatos but feel more connected to jazz proper than the minimal funk Michael Henderson would bring a short time later. Saxophonist Steve Grossman serves a more functional role, with solid workmanlike solos that mostly serve to make Miles’ time out front that much more exciting. And Jack DeJohnette’s drumming alternates between forward-driving and hard-hitting funk/rock and pure texture during more abstract passages. DeJohnette’s contributions underscore the defining quality of the music here: it’s relentless energy. The opener for each night, the Joe Zawinul composition “Directions”, sets the bar very high in this department. It’s built around a brilliantly simple bassline and has a classic theme that only shows up later in the piece, signaling when to pass the soloing baton to the next player. Miles would lose interest in this sort of structure over the next couple of years, but “Directions” is the perfect tune for him at this moment, and hearing the four show kick-offs in one place provides an opportunity to see how pieces varied from night to night. Wednesday night absolutely rips, as Holland’s bass refrain drives the song forward almost faster than the band wants to go. Thursday is comparatively mellow and exploratory, allowing for more space. On Friday DeJohnette takes a less polyrhythmic approach to drums and Miles is more fluid and less intense in his soloing. And then Saturday is lighter and trickier, with more quick rhythmic interplay. The set lists each night were almost identical—“The Mask”, “It’s About That Time”, “I Fall in Love Too Easily”, and “Bitches Brew” are all heard in multiple versions—but jumping to different takes from disc-to-disc never feels redundant, such is the invention and variation with each performance. Each phase of Miles Davis’ development calls for a different kind of listening. Both 1969 and 1970, to my ears, are more accessible than the late-period material with the second quintet, with its unusual harmonies and deceptive structure. Nefertiti from 1967 truly feels like a puzzle, something I’ll be working to understand forever, but the appeal of the Miles at the Fillmore material is obvious: This is an amazing band and they rip, but they never leave traditional ideas of rhythm and melody behind. There are extended soundscape passages in “Bitches Brew” and “The Mask” that are more about experiments in timbre, exploring how jazz improvisation can become the furthest-out space music possible, but the best of this set comes in hearing these players creating a new sound that remains immediate. You’re hearing jazz form straining against its enclosure, and soon enough, it would be abandoned—by 1974, another key era, musicality would not be a priority, as black-hole-level density took over completely. Any notion of mainstream acceptance was pretty much gone by then, and Miles and his band were doing brilliant things with that freedom. Here they’re doing equally brilliant things within certain strictures, making up a few rules and bending a few others to the breaking point.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19079-miles-davis-miles-at-the-fillmore-miles-davis-1970-the-bootleg-series-vol-3/,"Columbia,Legacy",2014.0
177,Johnny Cash,Out Among the Stars,Folk/Country,7.4,March 27 2014,Kim Kelly,Contributor,"Writing about Johnny Cash is a lot like writing about religion: It’s tough to know where to start, and most folks have their own unshakable ideas on the subject and little interest in your interpretation. At the heart of the matter lies a simple truth: it's difficult to cast a critical eye over something you’ve grown up with, a presence you've always taken as gospel. So it must be said that not everything Johnny Cash recorded was hewn from pure gold. We sometimes need reminding that despite his larger-than-life existence, at the end of the day he was but a man, one who made plenty of mistakes, both personal and musical. Cash’s flawed humanity is one of the reasons why so very many people were drawn to him, and why we remember him still. This newest addition to his ever-expanding body of posthumous work, an album originally recorded 30 years ago but never released at the time, provides additional context for one of the strangest and most flawed periods of his career, and offers up a few damn good tunes in the bargain. Out Among the Stars dates to the 1980s, which may as well have been Cash’s lost decade. Nashville was so enamored of its rhinestone cowboys and gritty outlaws that the Man in Black slipped between the cracks and, in his own words, became largely invisible. His rough-and-tumble persona had been softened by television appearances and married life, and it didn’t help that his three decades with Columbia Records had left both Cash and the label sour on one another. The early 80s marked a high point in the chart battle between Bakersfield-influenced pop country and the burgeoning outlaw scene, and it was during this uncertain period between 1981 and 1984 that the Out Among the Stars sessions took place. Cash showed his chameleon colors by electing to record a duet with notorious rabble-rouser Waylon Jennings called “I’m Moving On”, and this move—not to mention his close ties with Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson thanks to their shared time as the Highwaymen—seemed to place his allegiance firmly in the outlaw camp. And yet, the sessions were recorded with au courant countrypolitan hitmaker Billy Sherrill. The album was shelved and remained in the vault until Cash’s son John Carter Cash stumbled across the recordings in 2012 and, joined by co-producer Steve Berkowitz and musicians Marty Stuart, Buddy Miller, and Carlene Carter, restored the album for release. The thing about Johnny Cash has always been that when he’s on, he’s great, but when he’s not, it can be jarring and almost uncomfortable, like seeing a favorite uncle swig from a hip flask at Christmas. Out Among the Stars is strongest when it stays close to his roughshod roots and rock’n’roll spirit, and it fumbles when it comes to the sappy stuff. There are only a few awkward moments, but they’re hard to ignore. Still, the good outweighs the bad, and you couldn’t be faulted for picking and choosing your sips of poison here. Given its origins, it’s no small wonder that the album comes off more as a collection of songs rather than a unified whole; listening to it all in one go dims a bit of the individual songs’ sparkle. But man, do some of these cuts sparkle. The opening title track is classic Cash: straightforward and conversational, with punchy Springsteen-gone-bad lyrics (“It’s midnight at a liquor store in Texas, closing time and now the day is done/ When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol, he can’t find a job, but Lord, he’s found a gun”) and a rollicking beat. The protagonist remains a sympathetic figure even as he turns to crime and, as is his wont, Cash puts a lot of himself into those words. It’s a reassuring way to open the album and it dovetails nicely with “Baby Ride Easy”, the first and better of Johnny’s two duets with June; ""Easy"" is a homespun exchange with an easy twang and bouncy upbeat, and third wheel Carlene Carter’s backing harmonies add a little extra fullness to June’s verses. On the downside, “After All” is a gospel-tinged piano ballad about lost love that constitutes the album’s weakest three minutes. Cash’s warm baritone is the focal point, but the track feels more schmaltzy than sincere. A few other ballads fair better. “Tennessee” is a nostalgic love note to his birthplace replete with weepy strings and a children’s chorus, and “Don’t You Think Its Come Our Time” is another endearingly sweet duet with June backed by a gentle mix of acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, and upright bass. Saccharine and earnest, the pair sound more like a mooney-eyed young couple singing at a church social; with anyone else, it would sound utterly hackneyed, but their chemistry makes all the difference. Turns out Johnny the heartbreaker is ultimately a lot more fun to listen to than Johnny the loyal husband. The simple country traipse of “If I Told You Who It Was” sees Cash get nice and comfortable in his role as a storyteller with a wink and a grin, spinning a yarn about a nameless country star with a figure that just won’t quit. “I Drove Her Out of My Mind” makes good use of his oaky baritone and just begs to be played in a dingy barroom full of jilted shadows, while steel guitar swinger “Rock and Roll Shoes” sees Cash unapologetic as ever, trucking along defiantly with a rockabilly strut. “She Used to Love Me A Lot” is best known as a David Allen Coe tune, but as it turns out, Cash beat him to it by a scant few weeks. Though Coe’s delivery is uncharacteristically somber on his rendition, Cash’s version is an even quieter, more staid affair that finds him accompanied by a muted choir and soberly plucked acoustic strings. Where Coe howls, Cash mourns. Closing track “I Came to Believe”, a Cash original, offers an illuminating contrast to his late period, since it also appeared on his 2006 album V: A Hundred Highways. While the modern version is sparse and fragile, this piano-driven, gospel-influenced number showcases his voice at its finest. He lacks the later gravitas, but his strong, pure baritone easily commands attention and, wrapped around a song of hope and redemption, it ends the album on a high note. Johnny Cash is an American archetype—Paul Bunyan with a battered acoustic or Davy Crockett with a dobro tucked under his famous cap. To many of us, the low rumble of his voice is a comforting and familiar sound, and while we’ll never get him back, it’s nice to come across his ghost on recordings like this. Though it’s far from “essential,” Out Among the Stars is a boon for fans of country music history as well as those who just can’t get enough Cash. More importantly, it highlights a missing link between the often disparate eras of a long and complicated career.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19080-johnny-cash-out-among-the-stars/,"Columbia,Legacy",2014.0
178,Beyoncé,Beyoncé,Pop/R&B,8.8,January 6 2014,Carrie Battan,Contributor,"Should Beyoncé choose to settle in the world of Adult Contemporary one day, she'll have most of the legwork already done. She's spent the time since 4, an album that playfully extolled the virtues of marriage, crafting a role for herself in that sphere with the ambitious grace of a good politician. Imagine the fun she had requesting the big hair and bigger fur to help President Obama ring in his second term, or in gussying herself up like Marie Antoinette to promote an international arena tour called The Mrs. Carter Show. The hedge-betting deals with Pepsi and H&M, the (now-defunct) lifestyle blog/newsletter à la Gwyneth Paltrow's goop, the reunion with Destiny's Child, the exquisitely dull autobiographical documentary—she's seemed entirely poised to join Jay Z on his cloud of moneyed middle-age. In retrospect, the adult gloss feels like an elaborate foil to the trouble she’d been cooking up in private all along. Beyoncé, her fifth solo album, repositions the singer as the Houston-bred Yoncé, a woman lustier and surlier than B, more playful than Bey, fiercer than Sasha but softer and more natural than the lot. The album is brassy but elegant, its post-coital breath smelling faintly of cheap liquor sipped from a crystal flute. It finds Beyoncé shifting gears to pull off her most explicit and sonically experimental music to date, exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music. It’s tempting to read Beyoncé’s hard edges as an attempt to ride the success of Rihanna or Miley Cyrus’ risqué agendas—but to do so would be to look past the album’s true provocations. Beyoncé pushes boundaries not because it sells sex at every turn, but because it treats a power-balanced marriage as a place where sexuality thrives. At a time when when young people are gripped by an ideological fear of monogamy’s advertised doldrums, Beyoncé boldly proposes the idea that a woman’s prime—personal, professional, and especially sexual—can occur within a stable romantic partnership. Monogamy has never sounded more seductive or less retrograde as when dictated on Beyoncé's terms. The innuendo can be bawdy and overblown—""Can you lick my Skittles/ That's the sweetest in the middle"" on ""Blow""—but sincerely so. And who would allow Jay Z’s instantly infamous breasts/breakfast line anywhere near the stargazing boom of “Drunk in Love” but someone truly infatuated with him? What’s more is that the erotic themes don’t feel out-of-step with the album’s more decorous moments, like the stadium-filling “XO” or “Blue”, its requisite treatise on motherhood. In Beyoncé’s world, there are illicit doors to be unlocked in the halls of tradition and vice versa. The record reverberates with the energy of a conservative pop star navigating trends without grasping for them. Its crew of 44 writers, producers, and directors skews heavily toward the hip-hop realm and incorporates niche talents, something Beyoncé tried on 4 when she teamed with artists like Switch and pulled visual ideas from little-known European choreographers discovered via YouTube. It's the collective effort of an all-star team with a deep bench, with contributions from mainstays like Pharrell and The-Dream, to fresh faces like Chairlift's Caroline Polachek, a creative director from streetwear brand Supreme, and a practically-unknown producer named Boots. Beyoncé’s best songs often reject traditional pop structures in favor of atmosphere—she may have taken some cues from her sister Solange, who now leads a particular wave of collaborative, left-field R&B. The record, her darkest and lushest yet, has a tendency to echo, stop abruptly, or place two separate songs in the space of one. Its most bracing moments are also its toughest and weirdest, like ""***Flawless"", a two-part growler that makes feminist TED Talk fodder sound legitimately menacing. Timbaland and Justin Timberlake join The-Dream on ""Partition"" in service of the mean-mugging Yoncé, who snarls and bares her teeth as though the most revered rapper of all time is nobody but her little husband. At the center lies Beyoncé’s practically unfair abilities as a performer—you get the sense that Lady Gaga or Ciara could no sooner pull off the scale or quality of Beyoncé than you or I could pull off a suitable rendition of any of its songs in a karaoke bar. Beyoncé has loosened up her delivery, too, in a way that highlights her elasticity and shows her pop-cultural antennae tuned to the right channels. Who could’ve predicted that some of the most infectious snippets of pop music in 2013 would not arrive by way of anthemic chorus or assembly-line arrangement, but in Beyoncé’s ad-libbing? You already know the ones: Surfbort, she grunts on “Drunk in Love”, slinging a hashtag like it’s the name of a line of Ikea chairs, the single word serving as both shorthand for woman-on-top and a neat summation of an entire era of trends in rap cadence. You’d also be hard-pressed to find an internet-savvy person in America who hasn’t been possessed by the idea that he or she woke up like this, brain emblazoned with Beyoncé’s half-second I’m so flawless I gave myself a seizure dance. She's achieved the rare feat of validating meme culture by capturing its sneaky potency and delight rather than falling into its cheap, dehumanizing traps. This is a “visual album,” sure, but it’s also a package of modern codes and discreet campaigns, a field of meaningful virtual dioramas. In this sense Beyoncé has a newfound spiritual ally in Drake (Worst! YOLO!),—he shows up on Beyoncé on the bruised ""Mine""— her only peer to successfully streamline an internet-rooted mindset into a large-scale pop arena and seek profundity in the process. Which is all to say that Beyoncé has delivered on the promise she inadvertently made by dropping an album and its expansive visual counterpart late on a Thursday night in December on iTunes, free of traditional fanfare. Call it a coup or just another victory for her mammoth PR apparatus, but consider the alternatives: The strategy probably would have failed if the quality wasn't there, and the album could not have achieved such an impact without its rogue—in spirit, at least—method of distribution. Beyoncé was unleashed upon the world in a way that could only succeed right now, with an aim to make the audience consume it the way it would have long ago. It’s a line that could be ripped straight from the mouth of an investment-drunk tech startup founder, but it’s true: Beyoncé seized the powers of a medium characterized by its short attention span to force the world to pay attention. Leave it to the posterchild of convention to brush convention aside and leave both sides feeling victorious.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/,Columbia,2013.0
179,Childish Gambino,Because the Internet,Rap,5.8,December 12 2013,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"Donald Glover is a restless polyglot, and you can watch him tire of a medium just as he appears to get good at it. He caught the small screen bug after a stint as a writer for “30 Rock” and skated off to join the ensemble cast of NBC’s “Community” in 2009. With “Community” approaching what might be its twilight, Glover jumped ship this year to become the star and showrunner of his own loosely autobiographical FX sitcom “Atlanta.” He hasn’t had much time for stand-up since 2011’s hour-long special Weirdo. In a sense, his rap career, hatched in 2008 after plugging his name into an online Wu-Tang rap name generator and receiving “Childish Gambino” as a result, has been his most enduring project. It has also been his most troubled. Early Childish Gambino releases like 2008’s Sick Boi carried the playful “Just fucking around, sorry!” vibe of a rap career started on a lark but buckled under too much squeaky voiced Lil Wayne worship. Gambino later linked up with “Community” composer Ludwig Göransson for Culdesac and EP, proudly twee-as-fuck offerings that pondered Glover’s outsider upbringing over increasingly plush instrumental settings. But as the beloved “Community” awarded Glover’s musical exploits a higher profile, the pridefully uncool sloganeering of songs like Culdesac’s “Different” crystallized into spite. Gambino seemed to draft Camp, his nerd rage nadir of a debut studio album, as a piss and vinegar shower for his doubters. It spent more time thumbing its nose at the backpackers, racists, and dismissive women that gouged out the massive chip on Glover’s shoulder than it did, you know, trying to be a good rap album. The 2012 follow-up mixtape Royalty tried to recover by calling in buddies from Black Hippy, Wu-Tang Clan, and more to boost Gambino’s hip-hop cred, but he ended up getting creamed every step of the way by his more talented friends. This year Donald Glover got weird. He announced a new album, the clunkily titled Because the Internet, and launched into a promotional campaign that included a confessional series of Instagram posts about depression and fear, frank talk about mortality in interviews, an introductory prelude-cum-making-of-featurette titled “Clapping for the Wrong Reasons,” an installation at the new Rough Trade NYC store, and, finally, a 76-page, four-act screenplay that shares a title with the album. The star of Because the Internet is “the Boy,” the future estranged son of Rick Ross who gets his kicks trolling celebrities online and hosting mansion parties that only serve to amplify a nagging loneliness. The story tracks the Boy’s helpless, irrational descent to his own undoing. Viewed through the lens of the album and screenplay, Gambino’s pre-release antics may have even been part of a long con to tease the themes of the project out into the real world. If you’re fleet enough of a reader, the sequential song prompts in the screenplay reveal the album to be less of a stand-alone release than the full-fledged audio component to a daring multi-platform media project whose audio and literary wings collude to complement and even explain each other. “II. Worldstar” begins as a blippy trap number and takes a hard left on a found-sound fight sequence before landing on a psychedelic chamber jazz coda all because of a club night gone wrong in the play’s first act. Unfortunately, as the play begins to lurch with purpose the album resolves to allow the screenplay to do the heavy lifting. The third and final acts of the album are ill-served by the hairpin shifts in action they’re meant to soundtrack, and in the process, we get a series of jerky, very literal advance-the-plot numbers like “The Party” and “No Exit” followed by over-long, mournful fare like “I. Flight of the Navigator” and “II. Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)”, songs that are well-timed and appropriate in the context of the multi-platform project but don’t make much sense without the screenplay. It’s all very ambitious, but experiencing Because the Internet as the artist intended requires an hour of fully plugged in attentive reading, embedded Youtube clip viewing, and listening. On its own, Because the Internet’s album component breaks a number of Childish Gambino’s poor rap habits. Glover’s mic skills have radically improved since the last few outings, and his delivery is quite often formidable. The bouts of Kanye, Drake, and Lil Wayne tribute that assailed earlier efforts are mercifully absent. He seems to have found his own voice. Royalty’s injurious guest overload is scaled back in service to showcasing Gambino’s newfound mic control, so that all of the guests here are assigned hook detail. Chance the Rapper, Azealia Banks, Problem, and Mystikal all creep into the picture alongside Lloyd, Miguel and Jhené Aiko, but barring the Aiko spot on “Pink Toes”, Gambino takes all the verses. It’s a blessing and a curse; Gambino’s gotten rather good at the physical act of rapping, but he can still be a Christmas ham with the wordplay. The album is a minefield of wacka-wacka punchlines, facepalm-inducing hashtag raps and clever-until-you-really-think-about-it puns in spots, hampered periodically by gunk like “In the garage/ I had a menage/ I murdered the vag,” “I got no patience, cause I’m not a doctor/ Girl, why are you lyin’? Girl, why you Mufasa?,” “Yeah, you got some silverware, but really, are you eating, though?” and my favorite, “Tia and Tamera in my bed, I’m a Smart Guy.” (If you’re Smart Guy Taj Mowry, and Tia and Tamera are in your bed, you’re not getting any action. They’re your sisters.) With Gambino’s wordplay ping-ponging from caustic wit to message board snark, the enduring strength of the album is its production. Gambino and Göransson handle the bulk of it here alongside usual suspect Stefan Ponce and alley oops from twin act Christian Rich and Flying Lotus associate Thundercat. Because the Internet’s production team not only ensures the sounds are pretty, spacey, and jarring in all the right places, but they also effortlessly nail the album’s Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz synchronicity gambit. “III. Telegraph Ave. (‘Oakland’ by Lloyd)” kicks off with a tinny fragment of a Lloyd song bellowing out of a radio station and opens up into a full blown Gambino R&B showcase. (Glover might be a better singer than a rapper now, as tracks like “Telegraph Ave.” and the curt, exquisite “III. Urn” regularly bear out.) Following in lock step with the screenplay, you learn that it’s a Secret Life of Walter Mitty style bout of impassioned karaoke to a song that nails the protagonist’s station in life a touch too closely. It’s not only the album’s best song; Gambino’s hook writing nearly bests guys we’d previously thought him to mimic, and he slides masterfully into and out of a cogent sixteen on the back end. It’s also a fulfilling payoff for bothering with the totality of Gambino’s project in the first place, a gobstopping execution of a lofty idea. When the parts here come together you can catch a glimpse of Glover’s ambitious plan fully realized, but these moments run scarce the further into the project you trudge. This is saying nothing of the risky outlying assumption that everyone interested in the new Childish Gambino album is also interested in (or aware of) the new Childish Gambino screenplay you’re meant read online alongside it. Because the Internet is a nobly expansive attempt at plumbing the catacombs of social media for meaning and exploring the gap between the performative avatars we present as our online selves and the offline realities of our lives, but like the Twitter hounds and comment section warriors it speaks to and about, it could ultimately do well with a little less multitasking.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18817-childish-gambino-because-the-internet/,Glassnote,2013.0
180,The Killers,Direct Hits,Rock,6.4,November 21 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"You can let silly facts get in the way of seeing Direct Hits as one of the most hotly anticipated records of the past 10 years*.* Sure, the Killers have technically released four albums and a collection of miscellany that have sold over 20 million copies worldwide and the cool reception to last year’s kinda OK Battle Born suggests their days as a A-list rock band are pretty much over. But c0me on, we knew from the start that was all going to be irrelevant prelude at some point. In 2004, we had a couple of guys from Las Vegas with a careerist streak so blatant it was actually charming and Hot Fuss, an album with gargantuan singles and a complete lack of even adequate deep cuts. This pattern would be repeated three times over and as the years accrued, we fantasized of “Human” or “Runaways” being extracted from their vestigial incubators and collected on a Greatest Hits record that would be amazing. And how many other bands from the past decade can honestly claim more than four actual hits? From that point forward, it would be the only Killers album anyone would ever need, and perhaps seen as the only album they ever made. So how does Direct Hits still manage to disappoint even if we’ve already heard every single song on it? For one thing, Direct Hits is mostly chronological. Mostly. It begins with “Mr. Brightside”, and rightfully so, since it’s not only the Killers’ best song, but also one of the 2000’s as well. And it was the band’s first single back in 2003. But it shares a complex, tangled history competing with “Somebody Told Me”, as both had multiple releases and alternate videos, targeted for different markets. “Somebody Told Me” was the song that presented the Killers as a particularly UK-friendly Next Big Thing. The plural moniker generated a tentative association with the Strokes or the Vines, who were already signaling the commercial obsolescence of the ""New Rock Revival."" But the Killers actually got their name from the video for New Order’s “Crystal”, and there was a requisite disco thump and a cheeky, gender-bending sexuality in the chorus that placed them as an American counterpart to bands like Franz Ferdinand. Singer Brandon Flowers wore makeup too and that didn’t hurt. “Somebody Told Me” was certainly catchy, though their libido wasn’t remotely believable even if you didn’t know they were Mormons. If Hot Fuss stalled at “Somebody Told Me”, the Killers would be remembered more fondly than their thoroughly-ethered rivals in the Bravery, but not by much. Of course, the thought of “Mr. Brightside” somehow falling on deaf ears is more absurd than any of the faces made by Eric Roberts in its indisputably pitch-perfect video. Following in the lineage of “Is She Really Going Out With Him?” or “Jessie’s Girl”, the song itself is a karaoke classic for men grappling with the catastrophic realities of a woman choosing to have sex with someone who isn’t him. Only now, it’s given a properly dashing and desperate musical conduit and a performance by Flowers that makes the finest use of his limited range and dodgy breath control. But it was the track's second, Sophie Muller-directed video that sealed the deal, that truly unlocked the band’s potential as prime purveyors of ham & cheese—as Ryan Dombal noted, Roberts and Flowers are dueling over a game of checkers, and therein lies the Killers’ best look, stupendously simple, pure Vegas glitz, overwhelming in its accessible gaudiness. Whereas most bands musically summoning 80s teenage drama went backwards to channel John Hughes' visual aesthetic, the Killers went for the ostentatious, delightfully tacky drama of Moulin Rouge! and clearly, fellow Las Vegans Panic! At the Disco were watching. For the rest of Hot Fuss’ album cycle, the Killers wisely followed suit: the pompous stomp of “All These Things That I’ve Done” was set to a video where Flowers co-opts his entire suburban desperado chic from Violator-era Dave Gahan and “Smile Like You Mean It” is the platonic ideal for a fourth single that can coast on the success of the previous three. Before I die, I hope to meet someone who truly believes side-B cuts like “Andy, You’re a Star” and “Midnight Show” are the heart of Hot Fuss rather than proof of the Killers’ debut being one of the most laughably lopsided albums of the past two decades. But with those hits, combined with Hot Fuss opener and de facto single “Jenny Was A Friend of Mine”, the Killers accomplished what so many wanted of them, which was make the 2000s' answer to side A of Duran Duran’s Rio. But soon thereafter, it wasn’t enough to hear Bono and Chris Martin drop “I’ve got soul but I’m not a soldier” in their live shows as a kind of torch-sharing. The Killers wanted to be U2 or Coldplay, not in sound so much as in reputation. In short, a band whose campiness often appears to be some sort of glandular problem rather than a product of artistic intent, but are nonetheless given the benefit of the doubt and taken seriously. You might remember how this turned out, and so Direct Hits does exactly what it’s supposed to: salvage “When You Were Young” and make you forget everything that made Sam’s Town something other than Hotter Fuss. Which is to say, the Americana fixations (inexplicably reprised on Day & Age’s DOA single “A Dustland Fairytale”), the moralizing drug PSA “Uncle Johnny”, “Enterlude”, and “Exitlude”, and all the classic rock maneuvers that showed four musicians far out of their depth. At least on “When You Were Young”, their Springsteen ambitions were charming: you can spot the baldfaced “Born to Run” rip in the descending chord changes and the “Thunder Road” iconography, though Flowers’ honking vocals often make it sound more like the most compact Meat Loaf song ever written. But once again, it’s a blast to sing along with and Killers simply steamrolled any criticism the way true hits are meant to. Sam’s Town has since sold an estimated five million copies. Did you know this?  You can currently acquire many of them on Amazon for less money than a postage stamp, but that’s not the Killers' problem, is it? It actually is, at least in the way Direct Hits plays out. By the time you’ve finished the fifth track on Direct Hits, that’s all the Hot Fuss singles and “When You Were Young”. You have 13 more to go, including a demo of “Mr. Brightside” and the Calvin Harris remix of “When You Were Young”. The big draw is “Shot at the Night”, their collaboration with Anthony Gonzalez of M83, an act that hasn’t exactly overtaken Killers in terms of arena-filling synth-pop bombast, but have certainly cut into their market share. Like Direct Hits, you know what’s coming and it’s still kinda deflating: once again, the Killers adapt only the most obvious signifiers of their charges, M83’s hollowed-out synth tones, neon synth riffs not too different than their own, and an obsession with the connotative properties of “the night.” I don’t think Anthony Gonzalez is phoning it in here, though he’s big enough to do it—similar to Oblivion, it just shows that when it comes to soundtracking blockbusters, he’s a much better boss than an employee. Though their last truly ubiquitous single, “When You Were Young” established a problematic thread that ran through Sam’s Town, the “try everything” third LP Day & Age, and Battle Born, three very different albums that are of more or less of equal quality. There was a dissonance between what many listeners wanted out of the Killers and how the Killers saw themselves. They were in some aspects students of classic rock, though not particularly good ones, skimming the Boss, Bowie (“Spaceman”), New Order (“Human”), Journey (most of Battle Born), and the Cars (“Read My Mind”) like they were assignments handed down from their label. Likewise, many heard “are we human or are we dancer?” as a phenomenal non-sequitur, and it probably would be if Flowers didn’t make it a point to say he was actually paraphrasing Hunter S. Thompson. The Killers performed at a 2010 “Salute to the Military” show at the White House and didn’t even play the one song that contains their most well-known lyric, which is about SOLDIERS. Does Flowers' unyielding belief in his own profundity make Direct Hits even more effective as camp? Or does it make you feel like there’s a disconnect, that the Killers stopped believing there was a joke to be in on after Hot Fuss? And why weren't they any fun? Even more damning is that most of the songs on Direct Hits stopped becoming hits. Or, at least the kind that are meant to be included on Greatest Hits collections, ones that you simply couldn’t avoid even if you tried. Chart performance is typically meaningless in 2013, but the Killers actively seek out hits and have all the resources to make them happen. If they flop on the charts, that’s on them. And yet, they did flop—“Spaceman” peaked at #67 on the Billboard Hot 100 and promptly disappeared into the void. At its most popular, “A Dustland Fairytale” still trailed 35 songs on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Long-forgotten “When You Were Young” follow-up “Bones” isn’t even included here. The truly worthy comeback single “Runaways” stalled out at #7 on the Alternative charts behind Imagine Dragons and we were left to wonder whether Las Vegas was big enough for the both of them. At this point, the Killers are either a phenomenally successful cult act or a headliner in serious decline, and neither seems particularly flattering for a band that’s always aiming for the cheap seats. They topped a night of Coachella back in 2009, but it was a sparsely attended weekend that stood as the festival's bottoming out. (In their defense, give it four years and their headliner gig will look more justified than that of Phoenix.) Battle Born was by far their weakest chart performance yet, but look at it this way—they moved 114,000 copies in week one, whereas Arcade Fire’s first major label record just did 140,000 with far more visibility and career momentum. And Battle Born still got voted as the #2 album in Rolling Stone’s 2012 readers poll with “Miss Atomic Bomb” clocking in as the #1 single, a testament to the diehard fanbase of Victims. (No, I did not just make up that name for the Killers' diehard fanbase, it is 100% real.) If you’re doubting their intensity, when Rolling Stone ran a similar poll in 2009 for “most underrated album of the decade,” what finished at #1? Sam’s Town. But a Greatest Hits collection is supposed to surprise you with the familiar, to tease out how many songs from a certain band you’ve heard in the wild and make you think “wow, I didn’t realize that was all them.” Direct Hits proves the Killers have fewer actual hits, let alone great ones, than you thought and makes you wonder if they made their Greatest Hits album too early or whether they can ever legitimately put one together at all.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18699-the-killers-direct-hits/,Island,2013.0
181,Soundgarden,Screaming Life / Fopp,Rock,6.7,November 20 2013,Jason Heller,Contributor,"When Soundgarden released Screaming Life, their 1987 debut EP, grunge was not a thing. There were a few other bands slinging the sludgy sound that would soon be known to the world at large as grunge, but those groups—chief among them Soundgarden’s Washington State neighbors Green River, Malfunkshun, and the Melvins—barely shared characteristics. (Nirvana and Alice in Chains, meanwhile, were just finding their feet at the time.) The most striking element that set Soundgarden apart was their commercial viability: Of their peers, Soundgarden had the catchiest songs, the sexiest frontman in Chris Cornell, and the most conventional approach to making music. Catchiness, sexiness, and conventionality were all things grunge would eventually, if briefly, pretend to refute. From the start, though, Soundgarden’s music envisioned—if not promised—a nation of arenas full of flannel. Screaming Life is proof. Along with its 1988 follow-up, the Fopp EP, it’s being reissued by Sub Pop—only this time with a needed Jack Endino remastering job and one bonus track, the jokey throwaway jam “Sub Pop Rock City”, drawn from 1988’s Sub Pop 200 compilation. The latter is sheer filler, as is the six-minute dub version of Fopp’s title track and the passable, unremarkable cover of Green River’s seminal “Swallow My Pride”. That leaves eight songs out of 11 worth listening to on the reissue—some more than others. Revisionists tend to gauge Soundgarden solely in the context of grunge, but Screaming Life—and the two songs on Fopp worth listening to, “Fopp” and “Kingdom of Come”—have more in common with what was truly going on in alternative metal circa 1987 and 88: Jane’s Addiction, the Cult, and even Living Colour, each of whom sought to expand the tropes of metal by cross-pollinating it with other styles—not to mention weaving a shroud of alluring otherness in the face of bad-boys-next-door like Mötley Crüe or Poison. The fact that “Fopp” is a thickened cover of the Ohio Players’ 70s funk classic shows that, in a parallel universe, Soundgarden could just have easily turned into Faith No More. But they didn’t. Soundgarden wound up drawing from a broad palette while avoiding the funk-metal trap that so many of their contemporaries succumbed to. Even their breakthrough albums—1991’s Badmotorfinger and 1994’s Superunknown—owe more to progressive rock and psychedelia, respectively, than to grunge. Some of that structural oddness and swirling murk can be heard on Screaming Life, albeit sporadically. If anything, Screaming Life comes on like gothic Led Zeppelin. “Hunted Down” is cavernous and “Immigrant Song”-like in its pseudo-mythic chug, while “Tears to Forget” echoes the metallic gallop of “Communication Breakdown”. Cornell’s voice veers from Robert Plant majesty—steeped, though, in deeper shadows—to a scalding screech that he’d soon ditch in favor of a more melodic wail. “Entering” starts out with a drumbeat that resembles, of all things, Bauhaus’s “Bela Lugosi’s Dead” before morphing into lesser groove-rock aerobics. Finally tapping into the Black Sabbath wellspring that came to be a grunge stereotype, Soundgarden turns “Nothing to Say” into a ringing, doom-laden drone. “Little Joe” is Screaming Life’s lone disposable track, another foray into stiff-necked quasi-funk that feels squishy and unformed, as do Cornell’s monotone histrionics. He’d get better from there, as would all of Soundgarden. Not that you’d know it listening to “Kingdom of Come”—a would-be party anthem complete with douchey double entendre that wastes the talent of Kim Thayil, turning one of the most subtly inventive guitarists of his generation into a vending machine for riffs. It in no way predicts what the band was about to accomplish on its brooding, full-length debut for SST, 1988’s Ultramega OK, let alone during its stunning major-label years. Soundgarden would go on to become the most challenging of the mainstream grunge titans; 1996’s Down on the Upside is every inch as dense and harrowing as In Utero. But in 1987, Soundgarden had no way of knowing that rock as they knew it was about to radically change around them. Grunge has long been touted as the revolutionary insurrection that rendered hair-metal obsolete. But Screaming Life/Fopp is music that seemed to want to save hair-metal, not do away with it. And in that sense, it’s a halting, hesitant half-triumph.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18756-soundgarden-screaming-life-fopp/,"Sub Pop,Sub Pop",1990.0
182,The Beatles,On Air - Live at the BBC Vol. 2,Rock,7.2,November 14 2013,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"The Beatles mythos is a sum of historic locations: the Cavern Club, the Ed Sullivan soundstage, Shea Stadium, the Maharishi’s Indian retreat, the Apple Records rooftop. And yet there’s a place crucial to the band’s history that’s often left out of the narrative, probably because it doesn’t make for the most exciting Rock Band backdrop: BBC Radio studios. The lasting images of Beatlemania are ones of constant motion: of airplanes and tarmacs, of screaming teens chasing the band down the high street, of limousines that act as decoys for other limousines. But in the midst of all that hysteria, the Beatles managed to record 52 BBC radio programs over the course of 1962 to 1965, and though they were mostly born out of promotional obligations, the frequent shows allowed the band to engage with their fanatical fans from a safe distance. The BBC was where The Beatles could perform for an audience of millions without struggling to hear themselves sing over primitive concert-hall P.A.s, and where—via mailed-in requests—they could interact with their many admirers without worrying about being trampled by the mob. This much was evident on 1994’s Live at the BBC compilation, which functioned as a hermetically sealed time capsule of the Fab Four at their most innocent and fun-loving. The only evidence of the intense pressure the band were under at the time could be gleaned from the tracklist—with demand for new Beatles recordings far outstripping supply, the band’s BBC playlists were stacked with as many Reeperbahn-tested covers as Lennon-McCartney originals. Vol. 2 offers a similarly proportioned mix, with the now-familiar variations in fidelity that go with it. And it actually works within an even tighter timeframe than its predecessor, which reached far enough into ’65 to feature the proto-psychedelic jangle of “Ticket to Ride.” Vol. 2, by contrast, sticks to 1963-64; the tracklist reaches as far as Beatles for Sale cuts “I’ll Follow the Sun” and “Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey!” but stops short of showcasing the more reflective, emotionally invested songcraft that would define that album, and the Beatles catalogue from that point forward. Like most sequels, the new compilation presents a case of diminishing returns: where the first BBC collection yielded 30 songs that never surfaced on any of the Beatles’ proper albums, the new set features but two (in the form of Chuck Berry and Tony Orlando covers) and about one third of the tracklist overlaps with the first set (albeit with the recurring tracks pulled from different sessions). But, approached on its own terms, Vol. 2 is still a pleasure to behold. While it’s designed to evoke a bygone era when congregating around the living-room radio was British-household ritual, the grab-bag sequencing and strategically stitched between-song banter lend the collection a frenetic, cut-and-paste momentum that’s remarkably attuned to modern listening habits. Here, the Beatles sound less like legends-in-the-making than four school chums goofing off on an extended holiday, giving shout-outs to various Liverpool landmarks, playfully jousting with their straight-man hosts, and accepting offers of jam butties from listeners. And, further to this demystifying process, the recordings serve as a reminder that, like any aspiring group, the Beatles were initially a sum of obvious influences: the dirty lo-fi rip through “I’m Talking About You” serves as a test run for “I Saw Her Standing There”; a winsome rendition of Buddy Holly’s “Words of Love” points the way to “Do You Want to Know a Secret"" And yet, when you hear the band’s obvious affections for 50s hot-rod rock ‘n’ roll and Everly Brothers-style harmony-folk collide into perfectly formed pop salvos like “She Loves You"", “From Me To You"", and “I Want to Hold Your Hand"", it’s still hard to believe such a pure, crystalline sound could be produced by four exhausted guys playing live off the floor into mono mics. These songs may not form the basis for Cirque du Soleil revues or elaborate jukebox musical films, but, as fans from Billy Childish to Kurt Cobain to Alex Kapranos have attested, there’s a case to be made that The Beatles peaked as a band in 1964. In the absence of a rare-cuts windfall, Vol. 2’s most novel attraction is a series of one-on-one interviews conducted with each individual band member over the course of 1965-66, a good year removed from their most breakneck period. But beyond all the deliciously prophetic anecdotes—John pondering the place of politics in his life, George positing that the future of music lies in more sophisticated production, Paul recounting his experience attending a Stockhausen gig—the interviews are emblematic of a moment when not only were the Beatles maturing, so too was the very medium of music journalism; while the interviews are dotted with celebrity-tabloid-level queries like “how big is your house?” the conversations eventually drift into deeper ruminations on familial responsibility and, given the expected short shelf life of pop groups at the time, what the lads plan to do when the Beatles go bust. But even when faced with this more personal line of questioning, the Beatles sound as relaxed, confident, and in their element as when they were knocking out “There’s a Place” or “The Hippy Hippy Shake” earlier in the set. Though The Beatles’ regular BBC visits would become much less frequent as the band embarked upon their most sonically adventurous phase, these sessions underscore the impetus behind it: this band was always so much more comfortable in the studio than on the road.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18752-the-beatles-on-air-live-at-the-bbc-vol-2/,Capitol,2013.0
183,Pearl Jam,Lightning Bolt,Rock,5.0,October 15 2013,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"It’s been four years since the release of Pearl Jam’s last studio record, but it’s not like they’ve been far from view. In the interim, we’ve seen reissues of their two best albums (1993’s Vs. and 1994’s Vitalogy), three live collections, a slew of side-project activity, and a 20th-anniversary world tour capped by the release of Cameron Crowe’s documentary Pearl Jam Twenty. As that film illustrated, this band has much to be proud of, having survived sudden success and the attendant media scrutiny, a risky (at the time) rejection of MTV, grueling court battles with Ticketmaster over fair practices, fan backlash over the band’s more politicized gestures, horrible tragedies, and the overall collapse of the music industry with their arena-filling acumen intact. And yet, even an exhaustive documentary produced by a super-fan like Crowe doesn’t have much to say about the band’s post-millennial output—because there’s really not a lot to say. Pearl Jam ceased long ago to be a band that makes records with any sense of occasion to them: no intriguing backstory, no conceptual constructs to shape the album’s identity, no new contemporary influences that might push them in an unexpected direction. You just get another nine to 13 Pearl Jam songs that—as per the quiet/loud division of 2004 anthology *Rearviewmirror—*can be easily slotted into one of two categories. (Even the tracklist sequences are invariably similar: the second song will be a no-fuss rocker that serves as the single, and the album will inevitably close with a wistfully earnest ballad.) Pearl Jam are arguably the only modern rock band of note that consciously moved away from its formative, hit-making sound—in the period spanning Vitalogy through to 2000’s *Binaural—*but came out the other side an even more traditional, predictable band. So if you’ve been paying any attention to Pearl Jam’s activities over the past decade, you already know what to expect from Lightning Bolt (and it’s certainly not a tribute to the Rhode Island avant-metal duo of the same name; heck, even the Pink Floyd comparisons bandied about in pre-release interviews seem offbase, unless your conception of Pink Floyd begins and ends with “Mother”). Like 2009’s Backspacer before it (and 2006’s Pearl Jam before it, and 2002’s Riot Act before it), Lightning Bolt begins with a spirited sprint before sputtering out and winding up in dullsville. The feeling of déjà vu is compounded by the strip-mined subject matter, as Eddie Vedder explores familiar themes of family strife and domestic unrest while once again celebrating the therapeutic powers of surfing and listening to music on vinyl. If Pearl Jam can no longer recapture the sort of hot-wired intensity that once had Vedder stage-diving off festival scaffolding, they can at least still raise an inspired ruckus when the mood strikes: “Mind Your Manners”—a.k.a. “Spin the Black Circle Some More”—reformulates the original grunge cocktail recipe of mid-1970s hard rock and early 80s hardcore, with a chooglin’ intro reminiscent of early KISS deep cut “Parasite” that gets mowed down by a boot-stomping blitzkrieg, which in turn is blindsided by a sublimely melodic middle-eight. And “My Father’s Son” is the rare latter-day Pearl Jam rave-up to put the spotlight on bassist Jeff Ament, whose sense of groove—once the cornerstone of the band’s sound—has been deemphasized by band’s ever-growing propensity for straight-ahead, chug-a-lug rockers. Despite their punk-schooled principles, Pearl Jam have never been shy about their debt to classic rock, but it’s usually good classic rock: The Who, Crazy Horse, the Stones. And while the upward-arced anthemery of the title track and “Swallowed Whole” continue to dutifully honor this holy trinity, Lightning Bolt also betrays the long-term diluting effects of spending too much time hanging on the right of the dial. “Let the Records Play” is boilerplate, bad-to-the-bone blooze, while the album’s centerpiece ballads tread on odious Lite-FM territory and forcefully tip the scales from poignant to maudlin, whether it’s the Goo Goo Dolls sheen of “Sirens” or the Hornsby-esque piano rolls of the closing “Future Days” (definitely not a Can cover) that made the song a natural fit for the closing sequence of last week’s ""Grey’s Anatomy"". (By contrast, the countrified lament “Sleeping By Myself” benefits from a lighter touch, thanks to a gleaming George Harrison-style guitar refrain that draws the cheekiness out of the song’s woe-is-me sentiments.) The Pearl Jam mythos as it exists today is undeniably wrapped up in their notoriously epic live shows, wherein the band is famous for loosening up and stretching out, but for whatever reason, that adventurous ethos rarely translates to their increasingly mannered albums. Pearl Jam on record have essentially been reduced to the rock ‘n’ roll version of wearing sweatpants: they’ve given up trying to impress anyone, so they may as well be comfortable.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18645-pearl-jam-lightning-bolt/,Monkeywrench,2013.0
184,Nirvana,In Utero: 20th Anniversary Edition,Rock,10.0,September 24 2013,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"For the past two decades, we've essentially been living with two versions of I**n Utero. The first was officially released Sept. 21, 1993, though its legend was established several months prior. As the intensely anticipated follow-up to the most transformative rock album of the 1990s, Nirvana’s third record was pre-destined to become a battlefield in the heightening clash between indie and corporate culture, as mediated by a band that was philosophically faithful to the former but contractually beholden to the latter. While Kurt Cobain famously used the liner notes for 1992 rarities compilation Incesticide to call out the jocks, racists, and homophobes in Nirvana’s ever-expanding audience, In Utero promised a more aggressively hands-on process of weeding out the mooks, a concerted effort to realign Nirvana with the artists they actually listened to and away from those they were credited with spawning. And where the album’s title would reflect Cobain’s lyrical yearning for a back-to-the-womb retreat from celebrity scrutiny, it also proved emblematic of the record's messy birth: A by-all-reports harmonious two-week quickie session with recording engineer Steve Albini in a rural Minnesota studio would lead to months of acrimonious exchanges in the press among the band, DGC, and Albini over the purportedly unlistenable nature of the results, requests for cleaner mixes, and cruddy cassette copies leaked to radio that falsely reinforced the label’s misgivings. (The second-guessing circumstances were not that dissimilar to those of the preceding Nevermind-- wherein Butch Vig's original recordings were eventually handed over to Andy Wallace for a platinum-plated finish-- only this time, the outcome had the potential to affect Geffen's share price.) Upon release, In Utero may have debuted at number one, but initially it was something of a pyrrhic victory: Rather than lead a wave of Jesus Lizard-inspired noise bands to the top of the Billboard charts, In Utero would send millions of Nirvana’s more casual crossover fans scurrying into the warm embrace of Pearl Jam’s record-setting October '93 release Vs., an album that, from a music-biz perspective, was the true blockbuster sequel to Nevermind. In that sense, this first version of In Utero resonates as much today as a symbolic gesture as a collection of 12 unrelentingly visceral rock songs, a how-to manual for any artist at the top of their game-- from Kid A-era Radiohead to Kanye West circa Yeezus-- that would rather use their elevated position to provoke their audience than pander to it. The second version of In Utero came to be on April 8, 1994, from which point the album would be forever known as the rough draft for rock‘n’roll’s most famous suicide note. In the wake of Cobain’s shotgunned sign-off, it became nigh impossible to hear In Utero in any other context. The infamous album-opening lyric that once dripped with sarcasm-- “Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I’m bored and old”-- now sounded coldly nihilistic. Where the seismic stomper “Scentless Apprentice” invoked Patrick Süskind’s novel Perfume as metaphor for Cobain’s festering disgust with the music press and industry, the song’s grueling shriek of “get awwwwwaaaayyyy” suddenly seemed to be directed at humanity itself. The “Leonard Cohen after-world” fantasy of “Pennyroyal Tea” turned into wish fulfillment; “All Apologies” ceased to be an innocently plaintive pop song and was instead permanently etched into its writer's epitaph. But with this two-disc 20th-anniversary reissue, we now have a third version of In Utero, and I’m not just referring to the newly remixed iteration of the album. Taken as a whole, the package-- which also includes a remastered version of the original mix, B-sides, outtakes, a slew of embryonic demos, and a cheeky but affecting liner-note essay by comedian/tourmate Bobcat Goldthwait-- puts lie to the notion that In Utero is the soundtrack to a suicide, commercial or otherwise. In charting the songs’ evolution from rough instrumentals to the militaristic blasts of fury heard on the album proper, and through the outré experiments scrapped along the way, we hear a band that was on the cusp of an intriguing new phase. In a surprisingly conciliatory Musique Plus interview conducted just prior to the album’s release, Cobain stated that In Utero would mark the end of Nirvana as grunge torchbearers and, throughout the record, the band screech and howl like they're skinning themselves alive to expedite their reinvention. But not a lyric goes by on the album where Cobain doesn’t sound conflicted between what he wants to do and what he feels he has to do. The scowling verses of “Serve the Servants” are countered by the chorus’ soothing incantation of the song’s title, as if Cobain had to anesthetize himself in order to answer his audience’s populist demands. You didn’t need to hear the feedback assault of “Radio Friendly Unit Shifter” to sense the irony reeking from its title, while the sludgy savagery of “Milk It” deploys Cobain’s fascinations with bodily fluids and birthing to depict a soul being run through the music-industry wringer. Though Cobain claimed in the aforementioned interview that the deliberately bald language of “Rape Me” was his response to misinterpretations of Nirvana’s more ambiguous portraits of sexual/power dynamics (“Polly”, “About a Girl”), the fact that it cops the riff to his most famous song unsubtly directs the titular demand to his hit-seeking minders; when he answers his request by repeating “I’m not the only one,” he seems to be placating himself with the knowledge that he’s not the first punk-rocker caught in a boardroom power play. (And, in light of Cobain’s mounting disdain for the media, I can’t be the only person who’s always heard that line in “All Apologies” as “choking on the ashes of her NME.”) But this set supports the theory that Cobain didn’t necessarily fear or hate success; his real struggle was achieving it on his own terms. If he really wanted to clear the room, he could’ve made In Utero a lot weirder than it actually turned out to be: among the outtakes here is “Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flowing Through the Strip” (which previously surfaced stateside on the barrel-scraping 2004 box set With the Lights Out), an exceedingly odd, stream-of-consciousness ramble that sees Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl adopting the art-damaged inscrutability of then-underground darlings Pavement. Also included are Albini’s supposedly contentious original mixes for In Utero’s two singles, “Heart-Shaped Box” and “All Apologies”, which the band eventually handed over to R.E.M. associate Scott Litt to create the spit-shined radio-friendly versions that wound up on the final record. Furthermore, Litt's crisper alternate take of ""Penny Royal Tea"" (which scrubs off a layer of its Sebadohian scuzz) is featured here as a reinforcement of Nirvana's acquiescent impulses -- it first appeared on a special edition of In Utero created specifically for Wal-Mart that swapped out the title of ""Rape Me"" for the more big-box-shopper-friendly ""Waif Me."" (That the differences between the Albini and Litt's mixes are slight speaks to the sort of nitpicking the band were being subjected from without and within.) And in hearing the unvarnished demos of “Scentless Apprentice” and “Radio Friendly Unit Shifter”, you get a clearer sense of just how much refinement and fierce discipline they were subjected to before being presented to the public. (In particular, the versions featured in the band's MTV Live and Loud concert from December 1993 -- included in a deluxe four-disc version of this set -- perfectly encapsulate the In Utero ideal of arena-rock at its most anarchic.) There’s also evidence here to suggest that, in spite of In Utero’s caustic reputation, Nirvana were also keen to explore more sophisticated songcraft. “Sappy” was presumably kept off the In Utero tracklist (and punted over to the No Alternative charity compilation) due to its strong resemblance to Nevermind corkers like “Drain You”, but it still stands as one of Cobain’s purest, most effortless power-pop gestures, while the hushed B-side ballad “Marigold” serves as a test flight for Grohl’s Foo Fighters. Most surprising of all is an early demo of “All Apologies” with an acoustic, countrified shimmer that could practically pass for a CCR golden oldie, transmuting the song's overarching sense of resignation into bright-eyed, fresh-start optimism. Though Nirvana obviously had second thoughts about assuming such a radically chipper guise, that sort of willingness to mess with their essence would carry over to the band’s subsequent touring formation, on which ex-Germs guitarist Pat Smear was added to fill out the sound and the sight of guest cellists was not uncommon. This exploratory ethos also informs In Utero’s new 2013 mix, overseen by Albini with input from Novoselic, Grohl, and Smear. Strangely enough, the revamp was inspired by another rock icon who died at 27: Novoselic recently revealed the idea came to him after hearing a gussied-up Doors compilation that emphasized certain, previously unnoticed sonic details. Albini, however, has offered a more pragmatic rationale: In Utero’s quick gestation period meant some mixing decisions were made off-the-cuff, resulting in various instrumental parts, alternate guitar solos, and harmony lines being left out. As he told podcaster Vish Khanna, his intention was not to replace the 1993 mix, but to simply take a snapshot of the same songs “from a different angle.” The new version is in fact more textured and nuanced, but not at the expense of the album's bone-dry, brutalizing crunch. Most of its touch-ups are tastefully unobtrusive and illuminating, like the unearthed cello lines creeping behind the chorus of “Serve the Servants” that bring a greater sense of melancholy to the fore, or the screeching strings and slowly decaying fadeout of “All Apologies” that lend a more palpable degree of finality to the proceedings. But there are times where the listening experience is reduced to a parlor game of spotting what’s been added and what’s been omitted: On the upside, “Scentless Apprentice” now sounds like it’s being screamed into a toilet, pushing the song to exciting new levels of gnarliness, but excising the cello parts that are so integral to “Dumb” is, well, kinda dumb. Fittingly, for an album that starkly contrasts Nirvana's melodic and maniacal extremes, In Utero: 20th Anniversary Edition highlights another inherent contradiction: much like the Beatles’ Let It Be, what was originally intended to be a raw, back-to-basics reaction to past excesses has, ironically, been subjected to so much over-thinking and console-board tinkering (this latest mix constituting its Let It Be… Naked moment of revisionism). But all these mutations reflect the restless, irrepressible nature of these songs, which-- whether in the form of crude demos or modern-day remasters-- still sting and ooze like a flesh wound that refuses to heal. And yet In Utero is the sort of painful shock that, paradoxicalaly, reinstills the empowering sensation of feeling alive. Cobain may have been bored, but he checked out before he grew old; when listening to his final collection of songs, you forget, for a little while, the possibility of either.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18517-nirvana-in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition/,"Interscope,Interscope",1993.0
185,Lil Wayne,Dedication 5,Rap,5.1,September 11 2013,Corban Goble,Contributor,"The latest entry in Lil Wayne’s long-running Dedication mixtape series may be the least lazy thing he’s done in years. Which isn’t to say that it isn’t still a little lazy, befitting a rapper who seems more interested in his skateboard than in his music. Wayne’s lyrics still consist of packets of plangent nonsense delivered straight off the dome through predictable flows, and he’s mostly freestyling over other peoples’ songs on this tape, not always taking time to remove DJ tags from downloaded instrumentals (“New Slaves”). Even given all that, Dedication 5 presents a looser, more relaxed Lil Wayne which, in spots, makes Wayne’s unholy 2000s mixtape run seems like less of a distant memory. Dedication 5, it should be noted, comes at a particularly interesting point in Wayne's timeline. Though it's unclear when the collection was recorded, Wayne is coming off a major health scare and returning to his best-known mixtape franchise, a series highlighted by the modern rap classic Dedication 2. He's certainly coasted in recent years-- that hasn't cost him his radio ubiquity thanks to songs like ""Love Me"" and ""Rich as Fuck""-- but Dedication 5, on the surface, could be seen as an opportunity to reinvigorate his fanbase's interest. Certainly, it's deeper than recent mixtape one-offs like Dedication 4 or stopgaps like Sorry 4 the Wait, but D5 still has its fair share of issues. The tape is long-- 29 songs-- but fortunately highlight “You Song”, which finds Lil Wayne kicking back and letting an eager Chance the Rapper steal the track, comes early. (It would have been a highlight on Dedication 2, too). We're well past the point where Young Money marquee signees Nicki Minaj and Drake are obligated to step onto the boss’ mixtape, so the strength of the newcomer’s guest spot suggests that Wayne’s reputation is still sterling in some corners of the industry. Other tracks, like the Weeknd-featuring opener “I’m Good”, would work well on a retrofitted Tha Carter IV, while echoes of the “Mixtape Weezy” heyday come on the goofy, spoken interludes that punctuate Dedication 5, where Wayne introduces new, unmemorable signees before jumping onto the next instrumental. It all feels pretty familiar, and those who’ve bothered to tune in to Wayne during recent years will find plenty to groan over as well. He somehow outdoes himself with his lewd take on “Bugatti”-- don’t think about it, please just don’t think about it-- and often mails it in lyrically (“Had a phone in jail/ That’s a cell phone”). Though he’s still got an ear for the beat and can manipulate his flow to fit-- and, again, most of these bars are rapped without rehearsal, so adjust your mindset accordingly-- Dedication 5 is uneven, front-heavy, and too long for one sitting. But with both recent mixtapes as well as recent projects, Wayne has set the bar very low. What more can he say? It’s hard to know until the artist himself decides, but Dedication 5-- a release whose DatPiff page earnestly reads ""Welcome back Mixtape Weezy”-- shows that some gears are still moving.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18561-lil-wayne-dedication-5/,Young Money Entertainment,2013.0
186,Neko Case,"The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight...",Folk/Country,8.2,September 5 2013,Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,"It feels quaint to think of the days when people called Neko Case a country singer; she has spent the past decade moving towards a sound that makes genre descriptions seem as confining and anachronistic as corsets. Case got her start playing drums in Vancouver punk bands. Then at some point, thankfully, someone convinced her that she could sing. Even italicized, that word feels inadequate to describe the meteorological event that takes place when Neko Case opens her mouth. Case has a moonbeam for a voice: imposing in timbre, opalescent in tone, and always surprising in its sheer force. Case’s earliest records (the first two were billed as Neko Case & Her Boyfriends), were collections of country standards and spirited but generically twangy originals (representative title: ""Honky Tonk Hiccups""). But once she broke off on her own and started writing her own material, beginning with 2002’s bleakly stirring Blacklisted, two seemingly contradictory things happened. The first is that her music became increasingly more pop-oriented, owing in part to her collaborations with Canadian rockers the Sadies and a side gig as the resident siren in one of the best power-pop bands of the last decade, the New Pornographers. The other is that her music became darkly, magnificently weird. All of Case’s subsequent solo records have a surreal, untamed quality about them, thanks to her unusual taste in protagonists (tornados, female prisoners, man-eating tigers) and the idiosyncratic grit of her songwriting voice. ""If I puked up some sonnets,"" she sings in one of the most quotable verses of her endlessly quotable new album, ""Would you call me a miracle?"" It’s a fair question, coming from an uncompromising artist whose career has unfurled like a sprawling, unruly piece of free verse. After the release of her last record, 2009’s Middle Cyclone, though, Case weathered a rough patch. She lost her grandmother (with whom she was close), and then both of her parents (with whom she was not), and as a result-- something she’s begun to talk about in interviews for this record-- sunk into a depression. ""It was physically debilitating,"" she told The Guardian recently. ""You’re just in this murk. And you’re with other humans but you lose all your human skills and it’s just like you’re in this plastic bag and you can’t quite connect with people."" Case’s remarkable new album, The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You is an exorcism of this dark period of her life-- and also her most plainly autobiographical album yet. It is to Case’s discography what 2005's The Sunset Tree was to the Mountain Goats’: a seasoned songwriter known for evocative portraits of fictional characters finally turning that gimlet eye in on itself. The result is the most potent album of her career. The Worse Things Get is made of the same metal as Middle Cyclone, but fashioned into a much sharper object. The languid, mid-tempo ballads that occasionally made Cyclone sag have been replaced by songs that are shorter, tighter, and more cutting. Not a single one overstays its welcome, from the bracing, minimal self-help credo ""Afraid"" to the wistful ""Calling Cards"", a quietly devastating tale of long-suffering long-distance longing. ""We’ll all be together, even when we’re not together,"" Case's voice swells, finally landing on a bittersweet image that rings out long after the song fades: ""I’ve got calling cards from 20 years ago."" The evolution between these two records is most striking, though, when the tempo revs up. When it first came out, the punchy lead-off single ""Man"" sounded like a retread of Cyclone’s caustically poppy ""People Got A Lotta Nerve"" (""I’m a man, man, man/ Man, man, man-eater""), but within the context of the record (or even more obviously, if you play the two back to back) the earlier song can’t hold a candle to it-- ""Man"" is bottled lightning. M. Ward’s buzzsaw lead guitar rages like a feral creature in a too-small cage, which, Case’s seething, unbridled vocal point out, is exactly what it feels like to be imprisoned in the impossible expectations of femininity. ""I’m a man/ That's what you raised me to be,"" she taunts like a shit-talking prizefighter. ""Fat-fingered bullies were no match for me/ I still taste them in my teeth."" Case’s songs have long played fast and loose with gender roles and often star bold women (""We’ve got a lady pilot,"" she announced memorably on Blacklisted, ""Not afraid to die!""), but at the same time they reject simple, hollow for-my-ladies sloganeering in favor of more complicated truths. The “strong, independent woman” is a cliché that society often paints in black and white, but Case’s take on the subject is a portrait of innumerable grays. In a Neko Case song, freedom, strength and womanhood are all statements punctuated by question marks rather than exclamation points. But whenever The Worse Things Get risks getting too conceptual, a casual, mildly self-deprecating humor always brings these songs back down to earth. ""I was surprised when you called me a lady,"" she sings on ""I’m From No Where"", a subdued, acoustic comedown following ""Man"", ""'Cause I’m still not so sure that’s what I wanna be."" It might sound like a grand, abstract statement, but her logic's totally reasonable: ""I remember the 80s/ And I remember its puffy sleeves."" It’s an emotionally wrenching record throughout, but The Worse Things Get is at its most devastating when it takes up motherhood. Animated by rattling percussion and an arrangement that chatters like a dense forest, the opener ""Wild Creatures"" has an intrepid air about it (""I’m not fighting for your freedom/ I am fighting to be wild"") until it ends on a minor-key revelation: ""There’s no mother’s hands to quiet me."" This particular absence hovers constantly in the ether of The Worse Things Get, until it finally bubbles over on the stunning a capella centerpiece ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"". It’s a bold move and perhaps the most polarizing song she’s ever released; Case usually dresses her subjects up in magical realism and poetic turns of phrase, but she’s never worn her heart on her sleeve as plainly as she does here. The song tells the story of a mother Case saw screaming at a child in an airport in Hawaii-- ""Get the fuck away from me!/ Why don’t you ever shut up?""-- and as she sings them she slathers the mother’s words in reverb, the echo poignantly suggesting ripple effects they’ll have on the kid’s psyche. ""Honolulu"" hits like a shot to the gut. Case writes the song as an open letter to the neglected child (""Don’t you ever shut up, kid/ Please have your say"") and amidst the arrangement’s negative space, her voice is a thick blanket in the shivering cold. And that’s the most impressive thing about The Worse Things Get: though it’s a record that looks at topics like depression and parental neglect square in the teeth, its overall tone is one of resilience. The penultimate track, ""Where Did I Leave That Fire"" begins with a sparse, post-rock arrangement but eventually gathers into a triumphant and surprisingly comic midtempo ballad about mojo returned. But the true victory lap is ""Ragtime"", a rousing blast of ""Crimson and Clover""-esque pop that serves up hard-won hope and plenty of mantras for carrying on. ""I’ll reveal myself invincible soon,"" Case sings, as a parade’s worth of brass swells around her in agreement. Somehow, The Worse Things Get is Case’s tightest record and also her strangest. With its off-kilter arrangements and eccentric turns of phrase, it’s a world unto itself. If it has any contemporaries, they’re records like Fiona Apple’s The Idler Wheel… or Cat Power’s Sun-- the works of artists for whom “maturity” has not meant putting out that fire that Case sings so evocatively about chasing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18451-neko-case-the-worse-things-get-the-harder-i-fight/,Anti-,2013.0
187,Mac Miller,Watching Movies With the Sound Off,Rap,7.0,June 24 2013,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"Mac Miller skated into rap with all the bottomless happy-go-lucky charm of a best friend’s insouciant little brother. The documents of his early career are the works of a kid very much in love with hip-hop but frustratingly ill-equipped to translate his verve into compelling music. His songs didn’t feel lived in; their observations were as slight as their lyrics were clunky. Even so, Miller proved a hit on the underaged weekend warrior circuit, and despite a withering critical reception, his 2011 debut album Blue Slide Park became the first independent hip-hop album to top the Billboard charts in nearly twenty years. Things got knotty for Mac just as quickly as he took off, though. Beset by detractors and disillusioned with his career path (and the ever-present “frat-rap” association), he turned to promethazine to cope during 2012’s rigorous Macadelic tour. Miller also ran into threats of litigation from hip-hop producer Lord Finesse, who says his production was used without permission on a popular mixtape cut, and Donald Trump, who came calling after a 2011 single named after him racked up millions of views on YouTube. Miller kicked the promethazine habit, settled with Finesse out of court (although Trump still taunts him), and then summarily ditched his native Pittsburgh for Los Angeles, where he’s been palling around with members of Odd Future and Kendrick Lamar’s Top Dawg Entertainment collective ever since. Watching Movies with the Sound Off is steeped in the pathos of Mac’s bad year and the musical influence, both direct and indirect, of his new rap friends. It’s the wide-eyed kid brother of Blue Slide Park home from college extolling the virtues of meditation and salvia. Watching Movies with the Sound Off reintroduces Mac Miller as a druggy philosopher on the mic and a left field talent behind the boards. Gone are the undercooked shaggy dog stories of Blue Slide Park and mixtapes like Best Day Ever. In their place we get a batch of songs that break the surface with snarling, self-deprecating wit (“I don’t act hard/ Still read Babar” from opener “The Star Room”) and musings on mortality (“Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes” on “Avian”) and drugs (“That fetanyl, it numbs me/ ...Turns you into a junkie” on “Someone Like You”). There’s still a lemon here and there (“I spit the shit that leave a diaper brown” on the otherwise promising lead single “S.D.S.” and “Gees”, with its chorus of “Suck my dick before I slap you with it”), but the Mac Miller of Watching Movies, who feels comfortable trading verses with rap nerd favorites like Jay Electronica and Action Bronson, largely succeeds in distancing himself from the guy peddling kiddie-pool deep rhymes about drinking 40s in front of the police just two years prior. Miller’s Doom-esque witticisms are dispensed here over production that matches Wiz Khalifa’s 2012 cloud rap gambit O.N.I.F.C. for sheer druggy majesty. Miller handles a good portion of it himself, turning in loping circus music on “Avian” and eerie descending mellotron melodies on the absurdly titled “Suplexes Inside of Complexes and Duplexes”. “Aquarium” stir fries tUnE-yArDs' “Powa”, churning out a slow-building and hypnotic barn-burner replete with massive drums and tasteful strings. The rest of Watching Movies’ production is farmed out to blunted Cali hip-hop luminaries like Flying Lotus and Alchemist as well as emerging production talents like Clams Casino and Odd Future’s Earl Sweatshirt. Lengthy passages of stately, ephemeral soundscapes give Watching Movies the feel of a quixotic vision quest with Miller playing the role of the wizened sherpa. The hazy sprawl of Watching Movies also gives Mac a chance to dart outside the boundaries of hip-hop a little. He ditches rapping on a few cuts, exposing a singing voice in line with the Mark Everett school of coarse-throated, disembodied vocalisms on the oceanic Clams Casino assisted “Youforia” and Pharrell’s gossamer “Objects in the Mirror”. Both are lightweight love songs that make up for what they occasionally lack in lyrical profundity with an open armed earnestness. He one-ups both with “REMember”, a letter to a fallen friend full of heartsick what-if scenarios (“You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up/ So I could meet your son and talk you up”) and frank talk about the therapeutic power of crying. All three are instances of Miller imparting stories that dig deeper than the bedroom boasts and quests for weed that made up the bulk of his songwriting up to this point. Watching Movies with the Sound Off is a quantum leap in artistry, but it’s not without faults; the album’s about three songs too long, and a couple of the tracks in the back end just plain run together. Also, while all of the guest spots here are welcome deviations from Miller’s adroit Stones’ Throw homage, they routinely punctuate how much room he’s got left to grow as a writer. It’s highlighted most poignantly on “Suplexes Inside of Complexes and Duplexes”, where Jay Electronica shows up unannounced to kick a nonsensical verse, his first in years, and blows the whole album sky high just recounting the story of The Wizard of Oz, and also in the spoken word interlude after “Red Dot Music”, which features breakout battle rap star Loaded Lux lampooning “Easy Mac with the cheesy raps”, ruthlessly snarling “Who the fuck is Mac Miller?” Watching Movies with the Sound Off begins to broach the subject, but the question still stands.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18202-mac-miller-watching-movies-with-the-sound-off/,Rostrum,2013.0
188,J. Cole,Born Sinner,Rap,6.0,June 21 2013,Corban Goble,Contributor,"Born Sinner, the heavily referential second LP for Roc Nation signee Jermaine Cole, borrows its title from the Notorious B.I.G.’s ""Juicy"". By the time you’ve reached the record's end, you’ll have seen him try on a number of familiar hats. He repurposes OutKast's “Da Art of Storytellin Pt. 1” (“Land of the Snakes”) and fashions it into an anti-L.A. tirade. He duets with the remaining members of TLC (“Crooked Smile”) on a song that can be read either as a breezy style mash-up or as sacrilege. He co-opts a snippet of a Mike Epps comedy routine and he flips Cults’ “Bad Things” on a song about cheating, a track that also doubles down with Dirty Projectors’ Amber Coffman showing up to coo on the (long, guitar-heavy) outro. “Forbidden Fruit” finds Cole swimming in A Tribe Called Quest's “Electric Relaxation”, a track that also features a barely audible Kendrick Lamar. And toward the end, there’s a song-length love letter to Nas-- “Used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall/ My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw.” Who is the person at the center of all this outward projection? We still don't really know. Cole's second, attention-grabbing mixtape, 2009's The Warm Up, positioned him as an upstart unmoored from traditional conventions, an artist who could switch up flows, rap furiously and build his own hooks; Born Sinner finds himself standing in about the same place he was on Cole World: The Sideline Story, but the green room here is a little nicer. Listening to Born Sinner, you can't help but think of the gold standards of the modern era, among them Kanye West's first two albums as well as Kendrick Lamar's 2012 opus good kid, m.A.A.d. City (""Let Nas Down"" can certainly be viewed as Cole's answer to West's ""Big Brother"", which Cole references on the hook). Part of the reason you can't help but think of them is because Cole keeps bringing them up-- when you constantly point to the work of others, comparisons with them are inevitable. But while the production (mostly by Cole himself) favors the soulful, laid-back vibe of College Dropout and the string swoops of Late Registration, there's very little to make it distinct, something more than a nod to the past. Once in a while he can create something catchy-- the Miguel-featuring ""Power Trip"" almost seems like it was designed in a lab for radio rotation but the album as a whole splices together musical eras and reference without much purpose. Which is too bad, because some sonic innovation might direct folks away from some of Born Sinner's more grievous lyrical howlers: “My verbal AK slay faggots/ And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay faggot?” Later, a starry eyed Cole gets philosophical: ""Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up/ Only bad thing about a star is they burn up."" He finds something that rhymes with Kanye-- Wanyá, as in Boyz II Men's Wanyá Morris-- and races to build a line about growing up, a boy to a man, you see. On ""Miss America"": ""I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag."" It goes on like this. At its best, Born Sinner, showcases J. Cole's overall musicality, pairing his ability as a lyricist with a more broadly developed production palette. In a heat, he can rattle off some fierce rejoinders (See: ""Niggaz Know""). But several releases deep into Cole's growing catalogue, we haven't been delivered the savior that Jay-Z's ""A Star is Born"" seemed to anoint. (The latter's current indifference to Cole has become so pronounced that Cole has to keep squashing beef rumors.) Though much has been made of Cole's decision to bump up Born Sinner's release to the same day as Kanye's Yeezus, Cole is popular to a degree that suggests his sales will be competitive with Kanye's divisive-by-design Yeezus. That popularity, which has grown through a handful of big singles, is a testament to the fans who've been with him since his come up, fans rewarded with a recent string of $1 ""Dollar and a Dream"" performances taking place this week. But Born Sinner didn't turn out to be a reward in itself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17588-j-cole-born-sinner/,Roc Nation,2013.0
189,Black Sabbath,13,"Metal,Rock",7.0,June 10 2013,Hank Shteamer,Contributor,"The current Black Sabbath reunion has been star-crossed almost from the start. Original members Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward staged a splashy press conference in November 2011 to announce a tour and a Rick Rubin-produced album, but the mood quickly soured. Subsequent months brought a lymphoma diagnosis for guitarist and sole consistent member Iommi, a contract dispute involving drummer Ward, high-profile gigs with a fill-in behind the kit, and, finally, the eyebrow-raising news that the comeback LP-- the first full studio record to involve more than two members of Sabbath 1.0 since 1983's Ozzy-less Born Again-- would feature Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk. The peanut gallery snarked; fans despaired. That 13 isn't an out-of-touch embarrassment is a surprise. That it's cohesive, engaging, and even fun is a near-shock. As with most Rubin ventures, the goal from the outset was to help the band recapture their original mojo, the chemistry that made their initial 1970-78 run so brilliant. Does 13 measure up to classics such as Paranoid and Vol. 4? Of course not. No amount of good intention could recapture the black magic of the band's narcotically enhanced glory days, and while Wilk's performance is sturdy enough, no sub could eclipse Ward, one of the most distinctive rock drummers of the last 40 years and the engine behind Sabbath's signature sludge-blues cadences. But 13 does offer many of the primal joys that helped immortalize Sabbath in the first place, while documenting the spark that still unites Osbourne, Iommi, and Butler, all three of whom sound about as vital here as anyone could've hoped. The record's greatest strength is how well it captures the apocalyptic trudge that Sabbath nailed from the very first downbeat of their 1970 debut. The doomy passages in the first two tracks, ""End of the Beginning"" and ""God Is Dead?"", sound stupendously heavy. This isn't just a result of 13's raw production values; it's also that the band is clearly grasping for the same dire emotions (soul-deep malaise, reaper-fearing horror) that fueled their early work, emotions that from the mid-'80s on-- as Iommi carried on under the Sabbath banner with a Wiki-nightmare's worth of collaborators-- have shared album space with less weighty, more pedestrian hard rock. As Iommi, Butler, and Wilk lurch through the titanic riff of ""End of the Beginning"", with Ozzy sneering, ""Reeeeeee-animation of the sequence,"" it's clear that a legacy is being reclaimed. Osbourne, for one, may have squandered any remaining mystique when he opted for reality-TV stardom, but he proves here that he still wields an eerie power at the mic. The album doesn't fixate on crawling gloom. Early Sabbath is often portrayed as monolithic, but the band's 1970-78 discography was as eclectic in its way as the canons of the Beatles or Zeppelin. On 13, the band salutes fans with obvious allusions to some of their early outside-the-box classics: sassy midtempo groover ""Loner"" and the faintly cheesy yet improbably moving ballad ""Zeitgeist"" recall ""N.I.B."" and ""Planet Caravan"", respectively. And the sliding-panel, multi-movement structures of ""Age of Reason"" and ""End of the Beginning"" serve as a reminder that the original Sabbath explored their own outlandish brand of progressive rock on later LPs such as 1975's Sabotage. Aside from ""God Is Dead?"", with its plodding, laborious verses, the album's many long tracks feel brisk and hooky. As sturdy as 13's songs are, the album's signature feature might be its pervasive jamminess. Sabbath were never much for the drawn-out grandstanding of Zeppelin, but they did begin life as a blues band on the nightly grind. The group flaunts those roots constantly on 13, in the process spotlighting the partnership that's always been Sabbath's heart and soul: the Iommi/Butler tandem. During triumphant instrumental breakdowns in ""End of the Beginning"" and ""God Is Dead?"", the guitarist and bassist braid together like a heavy-metal Garcia and Lesh, forming a single mercurial mass. Iommi indulges in his share of well-deserved guitar-heroism throughout the record-- most notably on the exuberantly bluesy ""Damaged Soul""-- but with Butler shadowing him, these so-called solos feel more like hive-mind communions. It doesn't hurt that the bass tone on 13 is extraordinary-- one of the fattest and most gut-churning that Butler has achieved on record. Offsetting that blood-brother harmony is the odd man out behind the kit. The stiff unaccompanied drum intro to ""Age of Reason"" is just one of many reminders here that Wilk comes from an entirely different school, not to mention generation, than his collaborators. While Rage Against the Machine owed Iommi a significant debt in the riff department, that band's rhythmic orientation had far more to do with crisp funk than blues-based hard rock. (To find a truly sympathetic sub for 13, Rubin and the band might have looked to the contemporary doom-metal demimonde, home of drummers like Eyehategod's Joey LaCaze, who specialize in the grimy ooze that powered early Sabbath.) Often, as on the triplet-feel verse section of ""Live Forever"", Wilk sounds like he's trying hard not to mess up. And he doesn't, exactly, but something is lost in the effort. Bill Ward's genius was that he never seemed to care about meeting an objective standard of precision. The early Sabbath drum tracks are riddled with what could technically be described as flubs; they also feature some of the most exhilaratingly earthy percussion rock'n'roll has ever seen. To be fair, Wilk's appearance was always framed as a sideman gig. (The press materials for 13 diplomatically state that the band were ""joined at the sessions"" by the drummer.) And there are moments, such as on the sinister strut that opens ""Dear Father"", where Wilk achieves a real chemistry with his elders. Details aside, though, Ward's absence from 13 shouldn't be glossed over. His shaggy, intuitive swing may have been less commanding than the brontosaurus whomp of John Bonham, but it was no less integral to his band's signature sound. Sabbath has at times weathered their countless personnel shifts gracefully; for example, the lineup featuring late vocal great Ronnie James Dio, eventually billed under the name Heaven & Hell, attained its own special brand of dark majesty. Yet the fact that a full-on original-members reunion was promised and then retracted lends 13 a whiff of the consolation prize. In the end, 13 isn't what every Sabbath die-hard dreamed it might be: a true pick-up-where-they-left-off comeback for the group's founding quartet. But the record does belong in the view of every metalhead-- not just because such a seminal band still deserves obligatory props, but because, imperfections aside, the record embodies the kernel of the original Sabbath idea. That chilling crawl, that low-slung death-blues groove that seemed to come out of nowhere back in 1970, persists here in all its ominous potency, sounding out like an admonition of a genre that's grown increasingly overcalculated and gridlike during the ensuing 40 years, trading tortured humanity for robotic precision. Though fans may resent Black Sabbath for not resolving their personal differences more gracefully, one can't deny the pull of that existential outcry as channeled into what we now know as heavy metal. Their frames might be rusted, but these iron men still walk.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18165-black-sabbath-13/,"Vertigo,Republic",2013.0
190,Thundercat,Apocalypse,"Jazz,Pop/R&B",8.2,June 7 2013,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"The idea of the instrumental virtuoso has fallen out of favor in some underground music circles. This prejudice is usually based around the idea that anyone who has that much invested in the technical aspects of their preferred instrument has gotten so far up their super-muso ass that there's no emotional engagement in the music itself. Bass maestro Stephen Bruner's found a few ways to avoid that fate: cultivating a sessionman's versatility equally suited to gigs with both Erykah Badu and Suicidal Tendencies, aligning himself with the artsy but down-to-earth Brainfeeder community, and, as Thundercat, putting out solo work that, from the outset of 2011's The Golden Age of Apocalypse, used his chops almost exclusively for a feeling of fidgety joy. But what's really made Thundercat interesting over the last few years, and what gives his new Flying Lotus-co-produced album Apocalypse such a kick, is the sense that he's completely divorced his music from any sort of pretense. He doesn't put up some kind of esoteric barrier between the vision of a serious artiste and an unwitting audience that supposedly needs to be schooled on what true musicianship is. He's more dealing with a simple set of ideas, emotions, sentiments, and experiences, elaborated upon in a surprising way. At his best, Thundercat has reversed the evolutionary process where technology, experimentation, and crossover made music more complicated-- instead taking prog and fusion as a starting point to be whittled down, rather than a destination to be built up to. Apocalypse gets immediate real quick. Opener “Tenfold” takes off with the sort of astral-jazz keyboards you might hear on a Lonnie Liston Smith interlude filtered through the TONTO synthesizer. But the real pulse is an insistent pounding, chord-blurring 1-2-3-4 hardcore rumble that offsets Bruner's see-saw falsetto, tersely belting out sonic prayers two or three words at a time. It sets the precedent for an album that brings its catchiest tendencies to the forefront and lets the virtuosic stuff in through side channels. What comes up as a whole is this odd but endearing blend of plainspoken nonchalance and almost limitless musical eccentricity. If that means Thundercat's music feels a little more traditionally song-oriented than before, he's found a way to keep that unpredictable energy of his intact, filtering it through familiar forms of indie R&B (the Mono/Poly coproduced “Heartbreaks + Setbacks”), electronified soul-folk (“Tron Song”, which feels like Terry Callier gone glitch), and bristling, burbling old-school boogie funk (the straightforwardly danceable “Oh Sheit it's X”). The moments of ramped-up rhythmic hustle remain a prominent feature; the shivery rollercoaster arpeggios and hand-cranked forward motion of “The Life Aquatic” and “Seven” have the feel of some enterprising knob-tweaker attempting to electronically retrofit the Minutemen's anxious energy for a Detroit dancefloor. But everything falls together in a way that settles into a steady groove that stays easy to follow and sink into. The catalyst for this is that Thundercat's voice is more prominent and freewheeling now, as much of a driving factor in every song it appears in as the music backing him up. Where he falls short (but not very) in melodic range, he makes up for in stylistic variance: he's longing and frustrated in “Heartbreaks + Setbacks”, velvety and dance-drunk on “Oh Sheit it's X”, sky-gazingly ruminative on “Lotus and the Jondy”, warmly intense and motivational on “Special Stage”. More than ever, it feels like he's writing the instrumentation to fit his voice rather than substitute for or distract from it. And for a series of songs split with a dichotomy of channelling rich, often complex music through an engagingly human voice, the messages are unmistakeable. The OutRun arcade sunniness of “Special Stage” is a key example: the song's message couldn't be more straightforward but the juxtaposition of simple lyrics and complicated music is the whole point. While there's little that seems quotable on paper, little touches of goofiness and first-thing-that-comes-to-mind spontaneity-- the delivery of his “Your purse is nice, baby, is it leather/ Or could it be suede” pickup line on “Oh Sheit it's X”, or the trip-out “straight up seein' goblins” borderline non-sequitir on “Lotus and the Jondy”-- make him the relatable gravitational center in the midst of a busy intersection of sound. While much of its musical direction is based on Thundercat's collaborative brainstorming with Flying Lotus, the emotional core of Apocalypse rests either explicitly or implicitly under the shadow of the late Austin Peralta, the Brainfeeder musician and keyboardist/pianist on many of the songs on Golden Age of the Apocalypse. While there are specifically direct nods to his untimely passing-- most prominently on the elegaic closing suite “A Message for Austin/Praise the Lord/Enter the Void”-- the idea that Peralta's influence and memory runs through the entirety of this album's lifeblood makes a lot of sense. In some way or another, everything on Apocalypse is about taking stock, figuring yourself out, and making sure that the people that mean something to you know that they do. That it arrives through the conduit of somebody who has an elaborate means to express this, but knows when and how to keep things simple? That's how you translate virtuosity into something that hits you right in the heart.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18156-thundercat-apocalypse/,Brainfeeder,2013.0
191,Laura Marling,Once I Was an Eagle,Folk/Country,8.1,June 3 2013,Rachael Maddux,Contributor,"Laura Marling has spent the first few years of her career in a state of perpetual arrival. Alas I Cannot Swim-- her 2008 debut, made when she was 18-- was a bright, brooding collection that set her up as the darling of the latest British folk revival and saw her nominated for the Mercury Music Prize; a feat she repeated with 2010's more polished I Speak Because I Can. On 2011's sprawling A Creature I Don’t Know, she further established herself as an ambitious artist with a widening, sharpening vision. With each release, her talents-- keen songwriter, deft melodysmith, butterfly wing-fingered guitarist-- continued to reveal themselves so steadily as to have a lulling effect, like waves hitting some shoreline where it’s always high tide. But now here comes Once I Was An Eagle, the first of her albums to sound like a vigorously polished, hard-won achievement. It’s expansive and ambitious, and divorced of all the tweedy preening and aw-shucks raggediness the idea of “folk” has accumulated in recent years. It's dark, it’s angry, it’s even sexy, in a sly, subtle way. Once I Was An Eagle marks another, more literal departure: Making the record in producer Ethan John’s countryside studio was one of Marling's last acts as a full-time Brit. Whether she had plotted her move from London to Los Angeles before she wrote the album isn’t clear, but either way these 16 songs bear witness to the process, embodying the particular catharsis that comes from moving house, the existential tumult that so often accompanies the dismantlement of a material life, all that sifting through the detritus of past and current lives. She digs deep into the far-back grimy corners of herself, examines every scrap and trinket, fully weighs each of the thousand tiny decisions about what to throw out and what to drag along to the new address. (In reality, she took barely any of her possessions to LA.) This could be called a concept album, or a breakup record, though neither quite seems to suffice; “emotional bildungsroman” comes close, “scorching self-interrogation about the possibility of happiness and unpoisoned human connection in the wake of one or more failed or failing relationships, carried out under the ever-present pall of mortality,” maybe closer. As a lyricist, Marling has always favored a veiled sort of storytelling, her songs never not deeply felt but always more in the vein of short stories than memoir, and executed so supremely that sussing out the “real” from the “unreal” has always seemed beside the point. But this one feels personal in ways the others haven’t; the “I” of the songs is not always clear, as always, but seems closer than ever to being Marling’s own self. Eagle was made over 10 days, with just a cellist and Johns (on carefully-placed drums, piano, organ) providing accompaniment; Marling recorded her vocal and guitar parts in a single take each, and in one day, though it somehow sounds even more immediate. Present in both her singing and her playing is a ferocity that now seems to have been lurking there all along; at times, too, she’s possessed by a newly emergent serenity, and an astonishing ability to shift between the two modes. This is especially evident on Eagle’s opening tracks, four songs written as a proper suite and a fifth that feels equally of a piece. Together they seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, build from somnambulant finger-picked acoustic to a wild fury of howling cello and frantic tabla-style percussion, “Take the Night Off” leading it off the way a rainshower usually precedes a hurricane; by “Master Hunter”, the suite's cap, Marling is inhaling relationships and spitting them back out as heaving piles of splinters and ash. The rest of the album is spent digging through the rubble, out of which creatures and names and scraps of ideas turn up over and over: birds and beasts, the devil, water-- and, most prominently, the unnamed “you.” All through Eagle’s first half, this seems to be the same person, the same man: her “freewheeling troubadour,” the dove to her eagle. Some amount of drama has transpired offstage, though the specifics are not made clear, are perhaps too mundane to bother with; what's extraordinary is how Marling handles the fallout. On these songs she interrogates him, indicts him, admits her own cruelty towards him, always stopping short of apology, not even allowing herself to playact the rites of guilt. Later, after the sparse chill of “Interlude”, the perspective shifts, the cast widens. “Where Can I Go?” obliquely introduces Rosie, a figure perhaps understandable as some fragment of who Marling might have been before all this began. On “Little Bird”, loping with the immense grace of Nick Drake, Marling questions the girl, or herself: “Why did you run from everyone who only tried to love you, Rosie?” Meeting this seemingly crucial, recurring character so late in the song cycle is a jarring development; then again, perhaps that’s the point, to echo the shock of the the singer finding herself again, bloodied but alive at the bottom of all the wreckage. By this point, the album is circling itself, or the idea of its former self, as if waiting for the thing to die. Bits of “I Was an Eagle” return in “Pray for Me”-- the “preying” becomes “praying”; the climbing and swooping riff, there edged with a sitar-like guitar effect, here just simply thumbed along. Something heavy has been shaken off; some light is breaking through. “You asked me blind once/ If I was a child once/ And I said I’m really not sure,” Marling sang way back on third track “You Know”, in the dusky murmur she increasingly favors; now she finally has a reply, or finally lets herself reply: “I was a child once/ Oh, I was happy young/ When all I didn’t know needed doing had been done.” The question-asker is long gone; Marling doesn’t answer for his sake, but for her own. Knotting up that loose end seems to make the final quarter of the album possible-- that realization of what needs to be done, and then the doing of it; putting away childish things, which, in the end, seems Eagle’s core concern. “Thank you naivety, for saving me again/ He was my next verse,” Marling nearly barks, on the last track, over a mounting wall of what seems like every instrumental bit to appear on the previous 15 tracks: all that warm cello, palm-hammered percussion, billowing organ, and her steady, spangling guitar. The mess of love, of hate, has been sorted through, purged, sorted and packed away-- not entirely tidily, and not in a way that could protect against any future disasters, but enough for a fresh start somewhere else. Marling is 23; at first, the amount of time she had spent on this earth seemed relevant because nobody in her peer group was making albums like this. With Once I Was an Eagle, it’s because nobody of any age is making albums like this.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18066-laura-marling-once-i-was-an-eagle/,Ribbon Music,2013.0
192,Chance the Rapper,Acid Rap,Rap,8.4,May 7 2013,Jeff Weiss,Contributor,"In another world, you can imagine Chance the Rapper lip-syncing “Twist and Shout” at Chicago’s Von Steuben Day parade, surrounded by frauleins doing the money dance. You can visualize a rap game Ferris Bueller: arms outstretched to snare a foul ball, staring stoned at Seurat, ducking fascist educators, and oblivious parents with cinematic ease. You can hear his impression of Abe Froman, sausage king of Chicago, and it’s pitch-perfect. Barely out of his teens, Chancelor Bennett has already transformed himself from a suspended high school student to the young Chicago rapper universally adored among ""sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wasteoids, dweebies, and dickheads."" The release of last week’s Acid Rap triggered such intense demand that it crashed both hosting site Audiomack and Windy City rap agora Fake Shore Drive. Cops recently banned Chance from two separate high school parking lots after mobs formed once kids discovered he was on campus. But life rarely parallels a John Hughes script. Unlike Bueller, Chance actually got caught skipping school, a 10-day sabbatical that inspired his first mixtape, last year’s #10Day. His neighborhood of West Chatham might not be the worst in a city whose alias is Chiraq, but it’s still South Side and far removed from baronial Highland Park. The drugs are high-velocity, the slang is crisper, and in this scenario, Cameron dies. The victim was Rodney Kyles Jr., a close friend who Chance saw get stabbed to death one gruesome night. His memory haunts Acid Rap. On “Juice”, Chance mourns his inability to “be the same since Rod passed.” On “Acid Rain”, he still hears screams and sees “his demons in empty hallways.” The circumstances aren’t necessarily unique. Last year, Chicago murders outnumbered American casualties in Afghanistan. Drill stars, King Louie, Chief Keef, and Lil Durk have given the violence a public face with videos so dark they practically resemble a first-person shooter PS3 game set in Section 8. Acid Rap isn’t trying to be an alternative; it’s an attempt to encompass everything. There are shout outs, musical or lyrical, to practically every important Chicago tradition short of Thrill Jockey. It invites elements of classic soul, juke, gospel, blues-rock, drill, acid jazz, house, ragtime scat, and R. Kelly, Twista, and a young Kanye to the same open mic poetry night, where the kid on-stage is declaiming about what’s going unreported. Its genius is that he somehow makes this work. The structure is as expansive and freewheeling as any strange trip. Acid Rap is a less about the attempt to break on through than a way of describing the hallucinatory shades, transitory revelations, and cigarette burns of the journey. You can get off or on the bus at any juncture. There is no ideology or orthodoxy. No arbitrary binaries between conscious or gangster, apostle or agnostic. Freaks and free thinkers are accepted. Chance understands that those who are frightening are often frightened, too. He comes off as a guy who could find something in common with anyone but a high school principal. Chance mixes nostalgia with a nasal tone as effectively as almost anyone since the Pharcyde. He’s only 20, but “Cocoa Butter Kisses” laments the days of bright-orange Rugrats cassettes and Chuck E. Cheese pizza. It could come off like sentimental back-in-the-day cliché, but there’s a street-smart edge that holds the cheesiness in check. He puts Visine in his eyes so his grandmother won’t know he’s high, acknowledges his addictions, and invites Twista to play the smoked-out, speed-rap, O.G. Jedi. The guest spots mirror the funhouse characters you’d expect to meet on a memorable acid excursion. Action Bronson offers instant quotables on “NaNa”, sticking out his tongue, slicking back his hair like Rick Pitino, and peeling out in an El Camino with three Japanese lesbians. Ab-Soul plays the shadowy street pharmacist in the liquor store parking lot, opening up the trunk of his Dodge to offer grass, acid, and offside soccer metaphors. Chance’s Save Money crew partner, Vic Mensa and Childish Gambino act as effective co-conspirators. Some ears won’t settle to Chance’s voice. It occasionally recalls an Animaniac playing the harmonica, a scat singer with a mean soft shoe routine, and/or Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar. The latter is his most obvious immediate predecessor and clearly, Chance owes him a stylistic and conceptual debt down to the parental voicemail of “Everything’s Good (Good Ass Outro)”. But Chance’s vocals are mostly modulated for effect not eccentricity. The cartoon squawk of first single “Juice” bears no resemblance to the mournful Caribbean Kaddish of “Acid Rain”. He leans on his hip-hop inspirations as homage. The intro and outro flip a Baptist hymn from an early Kanye mixtape track. The beat from A Tribe Called Quest’s “Sucka Nigga” is repurposed for “NaNa”. Slum Village’s “Fall in Love” serves as the base for “Everybody’s Something”. 2Pac gets rightful daps on “Juice”. While “Favorite Song” artfully nicks the sample from Mary J. Blige and Biggie’s “Real Love” (Remix). Even if the voice leaves you cold, you could be sold by the sheer sense of playfulness and love of language. Despite the weighty subtext, it’s often fun and life affirming. Chance stretches syllables to ToonTown lengths. He caroms them off each other like a pool hustler sinking trick shots. He’s a “tobacco-packing acrobat/packin’ bags back and forth with fifths of Jack.” You tend to get swept up in the youthful adrenaline rush like Lamar, mixtape Wayne, early Eminem, or Jay-Z in the ”22 Twos” era. To make sure he has his own spin, Chance stashes his own psychedelics and local slang (“thot,” “dino,” “hitters”). If Lamar’s good kid m.A.A.d city stoked tension through plot cliffhangers, home invasions, and ominous minor chords, Chance’s Acid Rap is a triumph of meditative moments, open-ended quests, and brass flares. The hooks are more jabs than uppercuts. None will probably bang in a club, but most will make sense live, as chanted back by a thousand fans. “Everybody dies in the summer, wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it’s spring,” Chance sings this with funereal drone on the second half of “Pusha Man”. It’s the line that keeps sticking in my head when I play the record on loop. It’s a requiem for those already dead and a warning about the imminent carnage coming soon. It’s this fleeting spring afternoon where Acid Rap seems to take place-- the last day off before adulthood-- after you’ve realized your mortality, but before your fate has been sealed. When you aren’t sure if you’re supposed to say hello or goodbye.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/,,2013.0
193,Charles Bradley,Victim of Love,Pop/R&B,6.8,April 5 2013,Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,"With a roster that has boasted singers like Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, Naomi Shelton and the sadly departed Joseph Henry, Brooklyn-based label Daptone Records have forged their retro soul ethos for a decade now with a very calculated method: correcting history’s mistakes by signing aging soul starlets who have fallen through the cracks of time. So how label co-founder Gabriel Roth must have fussed when he came across Charles Bradley, a James Brown impersonator with a harrowing backstory. Enduring homelessness, extreme illness and the murder of his brother (all of which are outlined in the festival circuit documentary Charles Bradley: Soul of America), Bradley came with a marketable narrative and a dynamic stage presence. Most importantly, his voice gives Daptone’s house musicians a leading man who can channel not just Brown, but Otis Redding, Al Green, and Teddy Pendergrass to boot. To both Bradley and Daptone’s credit, the singer’s first album, No Time for Dreaming, didn't cash in on his distressing life story, but world-weariness did seep into his songwriting. It was as though harsh life lessons had taught Bradley not to expect a great deal from his apparent ""big break."" The love songs weren’t so much passionate romantic odes as they were desperate declarations of reliance, while the record’s marquee song, “Why Is It So Hard”, offered a cold flipside to the American dream. But what a voice. This wasn’t revivalism for revivalisms sake (a sneer sometimes made at Daptone), but a collection of songs sung with earnestness and authority that it trumped any such criticism. Two years on, Victim of Love is a more optimistic record, from the Motown-inspired catchy pop-soul number “You Put the Flame on It” to the gorgeous “Through the Storm”, a quiet elegy to bury his past traumas. But these fuzzy moments are offset by new forays into more coarse instrumentation. “You Put the Fame on It” aside, producer Thomas Brenneck pushes his artist from the 1960s into more 70s R&B than he’s previously been accustomed to. Think Curtis Mayfield’s transition from the swinging doo-wop of the Impressions to his solo, psychedelic blues of the early 70s. “Hurricane” trods much the same path as “Freddy’s Dead”, albeit replacing Mayfield’s drugged out nightmare with an environmental warning, while his handprint is all over the sizzling funk workout “Confusion”. Elsewhere, “Strictly Reserved For You” could easily slide into Al Green’s golden 1972-1975 run, and the chipped guitar lines that recall his great collaborator “Teenie” Hodges are matched with some fuzzy Sly Stone-esque axe. But Victim of Love is ultimately a less successful record than No Time for Dreaming. For one, Bradley seems less connected with this set. “Love Bug Blues” offers him some blaxplotiation-style cool to ride on-- all nasty guitar lines, fluttering jazz flutes, and forceful horn stabs-- but the lyrics uncomfortably cast him as a horny singleton who has caught glimpse of a potential new conquest. His major flaw, however, has been and continues to be his lack of ability to interact with his band. At times, like on overwrought ballad “Let Love Stand a Chance"", he sounds completely detached from what’s going on around him, as if he cut his vocal a capella in studio far away from his collaborators. This isn’t helped by Brenneck, who turns Bradley’s voice way up in the mix. Considering the singer’s sheer power it’s sometimes an imbalance. For example, the title track is a bare acoustic jam only backed up with some soft background “oohs” and “ahs”, yet Bradley attacks the arrangement with full speed gusto and his potent voice begins to overwhelm. These blemishes underline that Bradley is still something of a novice to professional recording and requires guidance to funnel his talents onto wax. That’s the job of Brenneck and the Daptone hierarchy, who are probably calling the shots when it comes to his evolving sound. But Bradley has a rare gift of being a singer worth hearing regardless of the material, and this alone is worth the price of admission.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17936-charles-bradley-victim-of-love/,Dunham,2013.0
194,"Tyler, the Creator",Wolf,Rap,7.8,April 1 2013,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"Odd Future ringleader Tyler, the Creator has a rap persona pitched between shock-riddled misanthropy and confessional reflection; he’s preoccupied with his own press and he uses his music as a vent for anger and frustration. His debut album, Bastard, was filled with sharp darts for rap blogs who wouldn’t post his music, while his sophomore album, Goblin, wanted desparately to prove Odd Future was worth all their sudden hype. In the two years since Goblin’s release, Earl Sweatshirt returned from Samoan exile, Frank Ocean opened up about his sexuality in a heartfelt Tumblr note and released the Grammy Award winning Channel Orange, and Tyler unveiled ""Loiter Squad"", an absurdist late night sketch comedy show. As a group, Odd Future embarked on a series of tours that connected them with an expanding base of teenagers and outcasts even as they drew fire from LGBT advocates, women’s groups, and a music press none too amused by the macabre content of their lyrics. A lot has changed, and now Tyler returns with Wolf. Where Goblin felt like an attempt to shoehorn the whole of Odd Future’s nihilist aesthetic into a single album, Wolf pulls back the curtain and reveal the talented introvert behind the music. The first thing to go is the bratty punk fury of earlier material. The insurgent bravado of “Radicals”, “Sandwitches”, and “French” is scaled back, replaced by songs that flip the conventions of his songwriting inside out. The songs about women are earnest where they used to carry murder ballads’ air of ill intent. Drugs come up, but we also hear about a remorseful dealer surveying the havoc he’s caused and a man having a mercilessly terrible time while high. Wolf is still the balancing act between gruff cynicism and juvenilia that we’ve come to expect from Odd Future (especially on “Pigs”, a bleak radio play about exacting revenge on bullies), but these songs are more three-dimensional. Tyler’s more likely to aim for melody instead of menace. Wolf as a whole also sounds gorgeous, and that even goes for the bruisers. The polyrhythmic hi-hats of the madcap posse cut “Trashwang” eventually give pause to a piano bridge, and the blustery lead single “Domo 23” gets a bump from a boisterous horn section. Foreboding numbers like “Rusty” (a lush reimagining of 1990s RZA production) and the nightmarish, tribal “Cowboy” are declawed by rich textures and melodicism. “Answer” sets Tyler’s longing for his late grandmother and absentee father to a bright guitar figure and shimmering organs. “48”’s crack epidemic reminiscence is adorned with elegant pianos, string stabs, tasteful guitar, and spoken word interludes from Nas. Tyler’s pet sounds are dark melodies hammered out on wonky synths and clattering breakbeats but here they come padded with embellishments that give Wolf a cinematic breadth. The album is pretty, but beguilingly so. There’s something not quite right, though, and it’s not just Tyler’s gritty basso profundo cutting through every melodic flourish. Pacing is one problem. Wolf reprises the winding sprawl of Goblin, hitting its stride on a series of midtempo cuts on the front and back ends but losing steam on a midsection that places too many of its longest and slowest songs back-to-back. “PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer” marries three unrelated fragments in a manner not unlike Domo Genesis’ Rolling Papers, whose passages of short vignettes gave it an off-the-cuff feel. But the pieces here don’t hang together, and “Bimmer” is too fleeting of a payoff for the uphill trudge it takes to get there. After that, there’s the lengthy “IFHY” (“I fucking hate you,” natch.), a bit of Neptunes worship so adroit that its plinking synths and jazzy chord changes give way to a falsettoed coda from Pharrell himself. (The Stereolab-channeling“Campfire” similarly summons that band’s Laetitia Sadier for a guest vocal.) Later on, the sedate acid jazz of “Treehome95” and the closing comedown “Lone” are inexplicably split up by the shrill M.I.A. send-up “Tamale”. Wolf is full of good songs but in the wrong order. Still, not all of the depressive sluggishness can be blamed on sequencing. Tyler makes very clear that he doesn’t enjoy the trappings of fame. The album is shot through with harsh words for critics, sheepish venue owners, puritanical parents, and groups who’ve picketed Odd Future shows. But if he’s surrounded by detractors, he only has himself to blame. He was bound to be taken for a ne’er do well by a mainstream public who first spotted him in a video eating a roach and hanging himself, to be read for a homophobe after filling his records and tweets with offensive slurs. Tyler should know that we don’t get to control the ways our words are interpreted when they leave our mouths to filter out into the universe, and we certainly don’t get to be coarse or crass without blowback. Over the length of the album, the defensive can become grating, and Wolf’s rebuttals are pointless anyhow. By now, you either like Odd Future and have figured out a mental workaround to reconcile their more troubling tendencies with their obvious talent, in which case this stuff is moot, or you don’t, and this acrimonious self-defense is ill-suited to win you over. With Wolf, Tyler, the Creator displays a radical growth as a producer, composer and arranger, even if, as a rapper, he’s still up to some of the same antics. Still, the album contains a few of the best songs he’s ever written. “48” is a wonder, “Answer” and “Lone” delve into deeply personal matters with poise, and “Rusty” is one of the most arresting lyrical performances on the record if you can see past the self-serving chest-beating. It’s a big screen rendering of the Neptunes-meet-Stevie-Wonder-in-a-microwave quality of Tyler’s earlier works, the sound of a creative mind coming into the possession of the proper means to carry out its ideas. At its best, Wolf manages to make the inroads toward accessibility that Goblin wouldn’t and pulls it off without sacrificing too much of Tyler’s refreshing capriciousness. When the album isn’t busy telling us that we ought to like it more, it’s delivering reasons why we actually should.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17805-tyler-the-creator-wolf/,Odd Future,2013.0
195,Lil Wayne,I Am Not a Human Being II,Rap,3.9,March 29 2013,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"The title is sadly accurate. Lil Wayne is a full-blown cottage industry now, a one-man corporation that provides succor and service to careers ranging from Nicki Minaj and Drake’s to Gudda Gudda and Lil Chuckee’s. With this many shareholders come obligations, so despite the increasingly obvious and pressing personal needs of Dwayne Carter the man, Lil Wayne Inc. steamrolls forward, impervious to setbacks. When Carter landed in the ICU for six frightening days this month, after seizures that many assumed were related to his ongoing, years-documented problems with codeine addiction, his handlers smoothed things over with the panicked dissembling of hangers-on propping up an ailing dictator. After his release, Wayne gave a thumbs up to TMZ cameras to allay fears, announcing he was “better than good.” He did look good, but he also, tellingly, shrugged and offered this: “My bum-ass album is coming out... March 26? It's 26?...You’re gonna get that shit or you won’t. If not, it’s whatever.” This spirit of indifference hangs heavy on I Am Not A Human Being II. In his review of 2011’s Tha Carter IV, Ryan Dombal observed that ""after an epic run, it seems as though Wayne has finally run out of inventive ways to say he's on drugs, or great at sex, or extremely interested in making money,” and two years later, the prognosis has only grown more grim: No song on IIis meaningfully distinguishable from the next. Everything pumps out in an undifferentiated slurry of interchangeable dick jokes, drug references, and lame puns. Tha Carter IV moved nearly a million copies in a single week, and this staggering success may have sealed Wayne’s artistic fate. All of the quirks and peculiarities that once made Wayne great have hardened, six or seven years later, into nearly unbearable tics. All of his lyrics have devolved into barely rearranged little puzzles of themselves, with countless versions of his ""She ride/ Take this dick like ___” formulation, none of them funny or creative: On “IANAHB”, a woman takes it like “advice,” while others ride it like both ""go-karts"" and ""the Kentucky Derby"" on ""Curtains”. His tweaking of gangsta-rap’s language has never been more perfunctory. He sounds terminally bored, and even the better rap songs on here-- the hits, like the Mike Will Made It-produced, Future-and-Drake-featuring “Bitches Love Me” or the rubbery, Bay Area-influenced clap of “Rich As Fuck”-- work around him, not with him. The only moments where Wayne sounds marginally interested in his own music come when he veers furthest away from rap. On “Romance”, he sings in his croaky, limber way about his profane version of love while Cool & Dre’s synthesizers smear like bionic fireflies: “She kissed my ankle when I twist my ankle/ She even did anal when she don't do anal.” On the big, clomping pop rock of ""Back To You”, his voice is a shpritz of Lil Wayne on the surface of a towering club-pop production, the kind that mashes together the respective sugar highs of Euro club-pop, hair-metal, and synth pop into a glutinous ball (If you’re wondering whose sampled voice that is crooning at the bottom of all that mess, by the way, it’s Jamie Lidell’s.) This might not be the most promising future to ponder for Wayne’s music, but they’re the moments he sounds happiest: as a cog in a much bigger machine than himself, set free from being the all-consuming center for the first time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17802-lil-wayne-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii/,Young Money Entertainment,2013.0
196,Depeche Mode,Delta Machine,"Electronic,Rock",5.0,March 28 2013,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"People who make machines use the termÂ ""delta"" to mean ""change."" Depeche Mode aren't so keen on that any more. Another kind of delta is the home of a strain of blues that's associated with more intense emotion and simpler technology than the synth-pop that made Depeche Mode famous. They got interested in playing with that kind a couple of decades ago, and it served them well, at first. But the partnership of singer David Gahan and songwriter Martin Gore can't escape the machine they've become, or the holding pattern they've gotten stuck in. (And then there's third member Andy Fletcher, who...Anyway!) The last album they made with more than two songs that have persisted in their live repertoire was Songs of Faith and Devotion in 1993. Since then, they've been on a steady regimen of releasing a studio record every fourth year, followed by a tour where they play a whole lot of songs from the era when Designing Women was on the air. Delta Machine, like Playing the Angel and Sounds of the Universe before it, was produced by Ben Hillier, includes three songs with lyrics by Gahan, and sounds like it could be a set of outtakes from Songs of Faith and Devotion. The word ""soul"" appears in five of Gore's songs here, not including ""Angel"" or ""Heaven"" (which shouldn't be confused with the earlier ""Halo"" or ""Judas"" or ""Sacred"" or ""Jezebel"" or ""Martyr""). It's old news that Gore's favorite lyrical topic is sin and salvation, and that's historically been a pretty fertile topic for songwriting in general. Unfortunately, there's no line here as sly as ""Strangelove""'s ""I give in to sin/ Because you have to make this life livable,"" and no sense that Gore's idea of sin extends to anything other than mildly kinky sex. Then there's the blues stuff, i.e. loops of bluesy guitar licks, as on ""Goodbye"" (which might just as well be called ""Personal Jesus XIV: The Personalizing""). Another one turns up in ""Slow"", repeating endlessly as Gahan sings Gore's lyrics about taking it nice and easy in bed these days. The requisite Gore vocal here, ""The Child Inside"", might have the most embarrassing extended metaphor he's committed to date (tears turn into a river that overflows and drowns the loved one's inner child?). As for Gahan's own songs-- this time, their music is by Kurt Uenala-- they're generally a reasonably convincing imitation of middling Gore. His ""Should Be Higher"" is yet another on the pile of ex-junkie lyrics; his ""Broken"" is a pale Silly Putty copy of ""Behind the Wheel"". It's not a totally dull record. Gahan and Gore are singing as well and hyperdramatically as they ever have. ""My Little Universe"" is a clever piece of minimalism, constructed around a bare handful of acid-synth riffs-- effectively a companion piece to their 30-year-old ""Leave in Silence"". ""Soft Touch/Raw Nerve"" is catchy enough that its rhyme of ""helping hand"" with ""understand"" is forgivable. ""Angel"" will sound pretty good on their next greatest-hits collection, as long as they don't sequence it too close to ""I Feel You"". Still, what made Depeche Mode work, when they worked, wasn't just the contrast between Gore's dry detachment and Gahan's dorky innocence (up to, let's say, Music for the Masses) and the late-breaking badassery that replaced it (from Violator onward). It was their constant pushing forward of their sound-- expanding the vocabulary of what electronics could do in pop songs. Their records were packed with cross-talking hooks, ingeniously knotted melodies, noises that blurred the border between pitch and percussion. They made rules for themselves, which made it more fun when they broke them. But they stopped pushing forward long ago, and now they don't even bother pretending technology has opened up any possibilities for recorded sound in the past 20 years. Now they're just extruding a new album once in a while, reconfiguring the grooves and keywords of the albums from the period when they were a force in pop, without the push toward new noises and uncertain feelings that made that music powerful. There is not a single moment of shock or freshness on Delta Machine, and it's enormously frustrating to hear what was once a band of futurists so deeply mired in resisting change.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17792-depeche-mode-delta-machine/,"Mute,Columbia",2013.0
197,Devendra Banhart,Mala,Folk/Country,7.6,March 12 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Insofar as anything about Devendra Banhart was ever considered ""underrated,"" the man rarely got enough credit for his sense of humor. He was often called ""playful"" or ""mischievous,"" or some other lightly stepping compliment that aligned more comfortably with the image of him as the kind and gentle Cosmically Transcendent Avatar of Freak-Folk. But check his track record: ""This Beard Is For Siobhan"", ""Chinese Children"", ""The Beatles"", Megapuss, and, oy vey, ""Shabop Shalom""-- dude's got jokes. If you still don't get the picture, witness the title of his latest album Mala. It's a term of endearment that loosely translates to ""sweetie pie"" in the native tongue of his fiancée, Serbian artist Ana Kraš. But as a guy who frequently sings in Spanish, Banhart must be very aware of how most people will initially read it-- especially in light of the artistic freefall he's been in for the past six or so years. If he's baiting us with a pun, it's a great relief to find out he's earned the right to fuck around, as Mala is Banhart's best record in nearly a decade-- largely because it's his loosest and funniest. While not exactly a trend within itself, it's interesting to see how Banhart's latest follows a similar route to recent solo albums from Christopher Owens and Jim James, longhairs who had similarly been burdened with messianic praise and rock savior archetypes. Like those men, Banhart has eased back on multiple levels after increasingly ambitious records, digging up pre-Beatles concepts of pop and rock while writing from non-punk states such as loving with levity and aging with grace. Mala's no less diverse than Cripple Crow or Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, but it's exponentially less heavy-handed in its genre-hopping. As the lovely instrumental ""The Ballad of Keenan Milton"" attests, he hasn't completely foresworn solo acoustic performance, but otherwise, these songs are short and spare, little more than reverbed electric guitar accompanied by light drumming and rudimentary synth tones. It retroactively posits him as something of a missing link between Ariel Pink and Owens, which is an accomplishment within itself. Most importantly, these are by far Banhart's most plainspoken and legible songs. Considering they're in the form of soft-shoe jazz or playful R&B, there isn't urgency per se, so much as immediacy resulting from how Mala often feels like snippets taken from Banhart's daily life. ""Daniel"" namechecks bars and street names as well as ""waiting in line to see Suede play,"" while the record's cloaking, murky production gives the impression that he stills lives on a more mysterious plane than most of us. It also gives Banhart the freedom to get a little goofy even when Mala sounds dead sober. The muffled disco strut of ""Für Hildegard Von Bingen"" reimagines the 12th-century mystic as ""a VJ on location"" and leaves it as just a passing fancy Banhart felt worthy of capture rather than some high-minded metaphor. Likewise, ""A Gain"" is more of an interlude than a song, about a minute of free-form violin and Banhart muttering lines about being a disappointment to his mother, hair gel, and the W Hotel. As he rushes to jam in every last word in the line ""love is gonna be a long lost biological father,"" he's laughing at his own emo capacity as well as the nakedly ""confessional"" format. For the most part, Mala makes good on its titular inspiration by way of including plenty of silly songs about love. Which is different than ""silly love songs"" in a crucial way-- Banhart's light touch with the more embarrassing aspects of relationships cuts against the occasional whimsy, and his self-deprecation feels earned, humanizing him as someone who can be a jerk in mundane ways: a guy who dated starlets but probably got yelled at for leaving the toilet seat up. Banhart takes on a deeper register that's equally suave and fatuous on ""Never Seen Such Good Things"", a song that borders on rhinestone cowboy pop. He laments a lost love with momentary nobility before the gawky phonetics and crude sentiment of ""if we ever make sweet love again/ I'm sure it would be quite disgusting"" make it a multilayered joke at the expense of our faulty memories regarding exes. This is even more pronounced on ""Your Fine Petting Duck"", a duet where Banhart and Kras play ex-lovers on opposite ends of a proposed reconciliation; Kras wants him back, Banhart is quick to remind her of the numerous ways in which he was a total ass: ""If he ever is untrue/ Just remember I was too... and so much more so."" For whatever reason, it switches midway to a lo-fi electro-pop thump while Banhart and Kras sing in German, because... why not? Even if it's fiction and decidedly anti-romantic in content, the feel is that of an inside joke between two people who really like each other; in practice, it's an ironic Valentine that's a powerfully effective demonstration of the conspiratorial giddiness of new love. So it's best to think of Mala as a new beginning for Banhart than a triumphant return to form-- for one thing, this is not the sort of record that will bring back the diehards who felt he fell off the moment he traded in his four-track, to say nothing of cleaning up his image and reneging on the promise of ""Long Haired Child"". And he still isn't the most fastidious editor of his own work; on the whole, it's for the best that his mojo and humor are given equal billing on Mala, though he should've kept the Zappa pastiche ""Hatchet Wound"" to himself. But one overly bawdy locker room joke is a small price to pay as Banhart sounds refreshed and relieved here, someone happily on the outside looking in rather than trying to situate himself as a countercultural star, and finally taking the opportunity to show that he doesn't take himself as seriously as a lot of people take him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17800-devendra-banhart-mala/,Nonesuch,2013.0
198,David Bowie,The Next Day,Rock,7.6,March 11 2013,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"Before there was Ziggy, Aladdin, Halloween Jack, the Man Who Fell to Earth, the Thin White Duke, Major Tom, the Goblin King, The Dame, the Mid-Life Crisis Soul Patch, and all the rest, there was the Mask. In 1969, when David Bowie was just another struggling London songwriter desperate for a break, he shot a promotional film to showcase his particularly dramatic brand of performance. Along with a handful of songs-- including an early version of ""Space Oddity"" in which a tinfoil-helmeted Bowie is seduced by a couple of space sirens-- the reel included an original mime piece called ""The Mask"". It shows Bowie, looking like the least intimidating pirate of all-time in tight white tights, a frilly top, and a pageboy wig, stealing an invisible mask and proceeding to charm his family, co-workers, and eventually entire concert halls by simply placing it on his face. ""Autographs, films, television-- the lot!"" he says, in voiceover, describing the opportunities afforded by his mysterious new facade. ""Had a very strange effect on me, though."" The mime ends with the white-faced ""star"" giving his biggest performance yet-- and then he can't get the mask off. It strangles him. ""The papers made a big thing out of it,"" he continues, ""funny though, they didn't mention anything about a mask."" Even before David Bowie gained a smidge of notoriety, he was well aware of its pitfalls-- and his own susceptibility to the lure of disguise. To put it mildly, this self-aware attraction to reinvention has served him well. In the 1970s, he rifled through looks, genres, and band members without hesitation, from space-age glam, to cocaine funk, to harrowing ambience, to name a few. In more modern terms, consider Radiohead's whiplash transformation between OK Computer and Kid A... and then consider how Bowie pulled off equally radical shifts at least five times between 1970 and 1980 alone. This malleability astounds because it runs so counter to the way most of us think and behave. It's non-conformist, uncomfortable, and irrational, without any of the detrimental consequences that are supposed to come along with such rule-breaking. Granted, a stupendous coke habit nearly killed him and he wasn't able to be a present father to his young son during that time, but even those disappointments led to the despondency that fueled his oblique Berlin trilogy. While many artists claim to despise the status quo, only a few have discarded previous successes with the abandon of Bowie, especially during that flawless decade-long stretch. ""Tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming,"" read the tagline in an ad for 1977's ""Heroes"". It was anything but hyperbole. Back then, Bowie may have had many masks, but he knew exactly how long to wear each one. The following couple of decades weren't quite as fulfilling, with Bowie reaching stadium success, over-diluting his art, and then doubling-back and over-corroding it. Whereas the 70s run was marked by unpredictability, the 80s and 90s were more transparently reactionary, with Bowie eventually following trends rather than leading (or ignoring) them. But this is what happens to rock stars, right? They age, they wither, and they eventually play 30-year-old songs to 50-year-old people who are doing their best to avoid nostalgia's bittersweet aftertaste while nursing an $11 Bud in the back of a basketball arena. Bowie could've gone that route. He didn't. Following the death of his mother, the birth of his daughter, the decision to lay down roots in New York City, and a reunion with Tony Visconti, the producer who helped him hit career highs like Young Americans, Low, and Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), came 2002's Heathen. The album found Bowie in a contemplative mood, finally finding peace by twisting up his own past in a way that did service to his accomplishments without overtly repeating them. The following year's Reality pulled off a similar trick, and it seemed like David Bowie was settling into a respectable late-career renaissance. And then, on June 25, 2004, he collapsed backstage after a show in Germany, and had to undergo emergency heart surgery. ""I tell you what, though, I won't be writing a song about this one,"" he joked, following the angioplasty. ""I can't wait to be fully recovered and get back to work again."" Nearly a decade of silence followed. Rumors of retirement or serious illness came up once in a while, but that's about it. In Paul Trynka's 2011 biography Starman, a friend of Bowie's was quoted as saying, ""If you were in hospital after a heart scare, would you be wishing you'd spent more time flogging yourself on tour? Or would you be wishing you could spend more time with your five-year-old?"" The explanation seems reasonable; Bowie was going to avoid rock'n'roll fogey-dom by avoiding rock'n'roll altogether while making up for his early fatherly failures. But then he figured out another way to move ahead. On several levels, David Bowie's 24th studio album is a cunning act of sleight of hand. On The Next Day, he hasn't only come to terms with his past-- he's making his old material work for his new material. For Bowie, the always-savvy son of a public relations man, it's good for business and good for art. The ""Heroes""-erasing cover is an admission, a boast, and a provocation (""how dare he!"") all at once. And by keeping the album's recording sessions a tight-lipped secret, the back-from-the-dead exclamation of its announcement was that much more pronounced. Also, by abstaining from any new interviews and only releasing a few drab black-and-white promo photos, he's all but forcing the press to go back through his archives to fill the inevitable cover stories from all across the globe. So, there's long-haired Hunky Dory Bowie on the cover of France's Telerama, a lightning-eyed Aladdin Sane fronting the UK's Q, a ""Heroes"" outtake peering out from Japan's Rockin'On. He turned the ""David Bowie is dying!"" worry into a thousand fawning would-be obituaries that instead build excitement for his new album-- all while he's likely sitting at his computer, sipping tea and enjoying the coup. The music found within is also something of a bait-and switch; on the surface, many tracks are uptempo rockers that recall various moments of Bowie's near-50-year career-- hopeful fodder for a tour that looks unlikely to take off-- but delve into the lyric sheet and you'll find death, war, graves, murder, and ghosts at almost every turn. Admittedly, this is not new subject matter for the singer-- his 1967 debut album ended with the theatrical ""Please Mr. Gravedigger"", an essentially a cappella tale of a child killer and a man re-digging holes for bodies after a bomb tore up their original resting places. And there's the glam apocalypse story of 1974's Diamond Dogs. But while those yarns could be fanciful and campy-- the musings of a young man glamorizing or sensationalizing the ultimate end-- The Next Day's deathly bent is more blunt. Inspired by English medieval history books, the title track tells of a man being dragged and maimed by an angry mob. ""Here I am, not quite dying/ My body left to rot in a hollow tree,"" sings Bowie, in a husky voice. The simmering ""Love Is Lost"" observes a troubled, perhaps suicidal 22-year-old girl whose ""fear is as old as the world."" It builds to a clenched-fist climax with Bowie ruefully pleading ""oh, what have you done?"" ""Valentine's Day"", meanwhile, is a Ziggy-style romp... about a tiny-faced school shooter; ""How Does the Grass Grow?"" offers a quasi-sentimental graveyard tale in which Bowie quips, ""Remember the dead/ They were so great/ Some of them""; ""You Feel So Lonely You Could Die"" wishes comeuppance upon a heartless Cold War assassin. You get the point. It may very well be his bleakest set of lyrics to date, words that don't glorify death as much as they detail its cruel inevitability throughout history. So while ""The Next Day"" could be seen as an optimistic phrase on paper, on the title track its describing nothing less than eternal brutal violence: ""And the next day, and the next, and another day."" Musically, The Next Day isn't as radical or dreary, as it bounces around from style to style, casually suggesting past greatness while rarely matching it. The production is clean and crisp, almost to a fault, leaving little room for the off-kilter spontaneity that highlights Bowie's best work; it's no coincidence that two of the album's best moments, on the skulking ""Dirty Boys"" and the taut ""Boss of Me"", feature glorious sax solos from longtime collaborator Steve Elson. Too often, though, the instrumentation sounds museum-ready. This is a shame, especially considering Visconti's pedigree-- this is the same guy who revolutionized the way rock drums sound on Low by pitching them down using a device that, he boasted to Bowie at the time, ""fucks with the fabric of time."" The same effect teasingly shows up ever-so-briefly on The Next Day, at the start of ""Love Is Lost"", and the Scott Walker-style closer ""Heat"" nails a disconcerting ambience, but otherwise, the album's sonics could've certainly been fucked with a bit more. In 1974, Rolling Stone sat a 27-year-old Bowie down with a 60-year-old William Burroughs to discuss accelerating technologies, the uselessness of love, and the quality of porn films from country to country: ""The best ones were the German ones,"" Bowie concludes. (In one of the few Next Day press photos, the 66-year-old Bowie sits beneath a photo of himself and the famed author from that '74 interview.) They also touch on the trappings of public perception. ""They want to see their picture of you,"" says Burroughs, ""and if they don't see their picture of you they're very upset."" David Bowie has made a career of walking that line between the picture people want to see and the one he wants to give them. In this way, The Next Day finds him as astute as ever, casting a ghoulish shadow over sounds and images we know and love. In fact, there was at least one exclusive magazine cover photo to go along with the new record; according to an editor's letter, the image that appeared on the front of last week's NME arrived in his inbox with the message, ""This is just for you. No-one else has seen this. David would like to be on the cover."" The photo, shot just last month, shows two eyes-- one pupil bigger than the other-- behind a stark white mask.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17855-david-bowie-the-next-day/,ISO,2013.0
199,Flume,Flume,Electronic,7.4,February 22 2013,Harley Brown,Contributor,"In an interview with Dazed Digital last year, Australian beatmaker Flume said, ""Music essentially boils down to two main elements, rhythm and melody. I feel tones and textures often get overlooked, so I like to take my time finding the right sounds."" The approach is working for the unassuming 21-year-old musician, otherwise known as Harley Streten: In November, his self-titled debut album and its single ""Sleepless"" beat One Direction for the number one position on Australia's charts. Streten celebrated by posting screenshots of the ensuing Twitter outrage. He doesn't come off as a firestarter, though, or even all that different from other young electronic producers. He listens to J Dilla and Flying Lotus, started tinkering with production when he was barely a teenager, and still makes music in his parents' basement. While his approach to warped sound owes much to Dilla, Flume's aesthetic can be compared to SBTRKT's integration of R&B's bedside intimacy with distant beats and silky voiced female singers. Streten explores his sonic palette with varying degrees of success on Flume. It's a little long on instrumental filler (""Space Cadet"", ""Warm Thoughts"", ""Ezra""), highlighting the fact that at this point in his career, samples and singers are Streten's most effective asset. Those features mask the fact that most of his songs are structured around samey, distracting background swoops that introduce climactic moments. On ""Sleepless"", singer/model Jezzabell Doran is Streten's Jessie Ware, though he gives George Maple more of the spotlight on ""Bring You Down"". Her featherlight refrain ""Hush now, you're standing on a landmine"" is the centerpiece around which snares skitter and arpeggios twinkle, her voice soaring as Streten drops a judicious beat into the bridge. On ""Insane"", Streten distorts Australian singer Moon Holiday's lovely but affectless voice into a melodic foil to his throbbing builds and drops. Sometimes, neither the vocals nor backing can save the show: ""On Top"" features uninspired rapping from New York MC T.Shirt (""The night's forever young/ It's us that gets old"") that falls flat over offbeat thuds and simulated siren wails. Now and then, Streten strikes an unusually potent streak: On ""Left Alone"", a chorus persists throughout as if dogging guest Chet Faker's slurred pleas for solitude. Preceding track ""Holdin' On"" juxtaposes an old-soul male vocal sample and gospel echoes (""Mama, I love you!"" ""Yes I do!"")  with muffled keyboard stabs and serious swing for an effect that recalls Jamie xx's Gil Scott-Heron remixes. Sinuous opener ""Sintra"" chops up vocals like James Blake's ""CMYK"", a foil for the calming, sweet ""Star Eyes"", which closes the album with a dream sequence made up of screwed bits of speech. On ""What You Need"", Streten makes a claim-- ""Been waiting to love you/ ... I've got what you need""-- shiver so that it sounds like she's slowly dissolving into tears. With that kind of control over his songs and performers, Flume could easily evolve into a sought-after producer.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17484-flume-flume/,"Transgressive,Mom & Pop,Future Classic",2012.0
200,Fleetwood Mac,Rumours,Rock,10.0,February 8 2013,Jessica Hopper,Contributor,"Fleetwood Mac's Rumours would never be just an album. Upon its release in 1977, it became the fastest-selling LP of all time, moving 800,000 copies per week at its height, and its success made Fleetwood Mac a cultural phenomenon. The million-dollar record that took a year and untold grams to complete became a totem of 1970s excess, rock'n'roll at its most gloriously indulgent. It was also a bellwether of glimmering Californian possibility, the permissiveness and entitlement of the 70s done up in heavy harmonies. By the time it was made, the personal freedoms endowed by the social upheaval of the 60s had unspooled into unfettered hedonism. As such, it plays like a reaping: a finely polished post-hippie fallout, unaware that the twilight hour of the free love era was fixing and there would be no going back. In 1976, there was no knowledge of AIDS, Reagan had just left the governor's manse, and people still thought of cocaine as non-addictive and strictly recreational. Rumours is a product of that moment and it serves as a yardstick by which we measure just how 70s the 70s were. And then there's the album's influence. Though it was seen as punk's very inverse, Rumours has enjoyed a long trickle-down of influence starting from the alt-rock-era embrace via Billy Corgan and Courtney Love to the harmonies and choogling of Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy and the earthier end of Beach House. Rumours set a template for pop with a gleaming surface that has something complicated, desperate, and dark resonating underneath. Setting aside the weight of history, listening to Rumours is an easy pleasure. Records with singles that never go away tend to evoke nostalgia for the time when the music soundtracked your life; in this case, you could've never owned a copy of it and still know almost every song. When you make an album this big, your craft is, by default, accessibility. But this wasn't generic pabulum. It was personal. Anyone could find a piece of themselves within these songs of love and loss. Two years prior to recording Rumours, though, Fleetwood Mac was approximately nowhere. In order to re-establish the group's flagging stateside reputation, in early 1974 Fleetwood Mac's drummer and band patriarch, Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist/singer Christine McVie, and her husband, bassist John McVie, moved from England to Los Angeles. The quartet was then helmed by their fifth and least-dazzling guitarist, the American Bob Welch. Not long after the band's British faction had relocated, Welch quit the band. Around the same time Mick Fleetwood was introduced to the work of local duo, Buckingham Nicks, who'd just been dropped by Polydor. The drummer was enchanted by Lindsey Buckingham's guitar work and Nicks' complete package, and when Welch quit, he offered them a spot in the band outright. The group, essentially a new band under an old name, quickly cut 1975's self-titled Fleetwood Mac, an assemblage of Christine McVie's songs and tracks Buckingham and Nicks had intended for their second album, including the eventual smash ""Rhiannon"". It was a huge seller in its own right and they were now a priority act given considerable resources. But by the time they booked two months at Record Plant in Sausalito to record the follow-up, the band's personal bonds were frayed, there was serious resentment and constant drama. Nicks had just broken up with Buckingham after six years of domestic and creative partnership. Fleetwood's wife was divorcing him, and the McVies were separated and no longer speaking. While Fleetwood Mac was a bit of a mash-up of existing work, Lindsey Buckingham effectively commandeered the band for Rumours, giving their sound a radio-ready facelift. He redirected John McVie and Fleetwood's playing from blues past towards the pop now. Fleetwood Mac wanted hits and gave the wheel to Buckingham, a deft craftsman with a vision for what the album had to become. He opens the record with the libidinous ""Second Hand News"", inspired by the redemption Buckingham was finding in new women, post-Stevie. It was the album's first single and also perhaps the most euphoric ode to rebound chicks ever written. Buckingham's ""bow-bow-bow-doot-doo-diddley-doot"" is corny, but it works along with the percussion track (Buckingham played the seat of an office chair after Fleetwood was unable to properly replicate a beat a la the Bee Gees' ""Jive Talkin'""). Like ""Second Hand News"", Buckingham's ""Go Your Own Way"" is upbeat but totally fuck-you. He croons ""shackin' up is all you wanna do,""-- accusing an ex-lover of being a wanton slut on a song where his ex-lover harmonizes on the hook. Save for ""Never Going Back Again,"" (a vintage Buckingham Nicks composition brought in to replace Stevie's too-long ""Silver Springs"") Buckingham's songs are turnabout as fairplay with lithe guitar glissando on top. ""Second Hand News"" is followed by a twist-of-the-knife Stevie-showpiece, ""Dreams"", a gauzy ballad about what she'd had and what she'd lost with Buckingham. It was written during one of the days where Nicks wasn't needed for tracking. She wrote the song in a few minutes, recorded it onto a cassette, and returned to the studio and demanded the band listen to it. It was a simple ballad that would be finessed into the album's jewel; the quiet vamp laced with laconic Leslie-speaker vibrato and spooky warmth allow Nicks to draw an exquisite sketch of loneliness. ""Dreams"" would become Fleetwood Mac's only #1 hit. Though Fleetwood Mac was always the sum of its parts, Nicks was something special both in terms of the band and in rock history. She helped establish a feminine vernacular that was (still) in league with the cock rock of the 70s but didn't present as a diametric vulnerability; it was not innocent. While Janis Joplin and Grace Slick had been rock's most iconic heroines at the tail-end of the 60s, they were very much trying to keep up with boys in their world; Nicks was creating a new space. And Fleetwood Mac was still very much an anomaly, unique in being a rock band fronted by two women who were writing their own material, with Nicks presenting as the girliest bad girl rock'n'roll had seen since Ronnie Spector. She took the stage baring a tambourine festooned with lengths of lavender ribbon; people said she was a witch. Like her male rock'n'roll peers, Nicks sang songs about the intractable power of a woman (her first hit, ""Rhiannon"") and used women as a metaphor (""Gold Dust Woman""), but her approach was different. At the time of Rumours' release, she maintained that the latter song was about groupies who would scowl at her and Christine but light up when the guys appeared. She later confessed that it was about cocaine getting the best of her. In 1976, coke was the mise of the scene-- to admit you were growing weary would have been gauche. Nicks' husky voice made it sound like she'd lived and her lyrics-- of pathos, independence, and getting played-- certainly backed it up. She seemed like a real woman-- easy to identify with, but with mystery and a natural glamour worth aspiring to. It's almost easy to miss Christine McVie for all of Nicks' mystique. McVie had been in the band for years, but never at the helm. Her songs ""You Make Lovin' Fun"" and ""Don't Stop"" are pure pep. ""Songbird"" starts as a plaintive ode of fealty and how total her devotion-- until the sad tell of ""And I wish you all the love in the world/ But most of all I wish it from myself,"" (an especially heart-wrenching line given that McVie's not quite ex-husband was dragging a rebound model chick to the sessions and Christine was sneaking around with a member of the crew). She didn't hate her husband, she adored him, she wished it could work but after years of being in the Mac together, she knew better. Throughout, McVie's songwriting is pure and direct, irrepressibly sweet. ""Oh Daddy"", a song she wrote about Mick Fleetwood's pending divorce is melancholy but ultimately maintains its dignity. McVie, with typical British reserve, confessed she preferred to leave the bleakness and poesy to her dear friend Stevie. As much feminine energy as Rumours wields, the album's magic is in its balance: male and female, British blues versus American rock'n'roll, lightness and dark, love and disgust, sorrow and elation, ballads and anthems, McVie's sweetness against Nicks' grit. They were a democratic band where each player raised the stakes of the whole. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks and McVie's new prominence kicked John McVie's bass playing loose from its blues mooring and forced him towards simpler, more buoyant pop. Fleetwood's playing itself is just godhead, with effortless little fills, light but thunderous, and his placement impeccable throughout. The ominous, insistent kick on the first half on ""The Chain"", for example, colors the song as much as the quiver of disgust in Buckingham's voice when he spits ""never."" In the liner notes to the deluxe Rumours 4xCD/DVD/LP box set, Buckingham describes the album-making process as ""organic."" Rumours is anything but, and that is part of its genius-- it's so flawless it feels far from nature. It is more like a peak human feat of Olympic-level studio craft. It was made better by its myopia and brutal circumstances: the wounded pride of a recently dumped Buckingham, the new hit of ""Rhiannon"", goading Nicks to fight for inclusion of her own songs, Christine McVie attempting to salve her heart with ""Songbird."" That Fleetwood Mac had become the biggest record Warner Bros. had ever released while the band was making Rumours allowed for an impossibly long tether for them to dick around and correct the next album until it was immaculate. Given the standalone nature of Rumours, it's difficult to argue that any other part of the box set is necessary. The live recordings of the Rumours tour are fine, lively even (perhaps owing to Fleetwood rationing a Heineken cap of coke to each band member to power performances). Only a handful of tracks on the two discs of the sessions outtakes lend any greater understanding of the process behind it. One is ""Dreams (Take 2)"", which is just Nicks voice, some burbling organ, and rough rhythm guitar gives an appreciation of her fundamental talent as well as Buckingham's ability to transform it; it makes the case for how much they needed each other. Another is ""Second Hand News (Early Take)"", which features Buckingham mumbling lyrics so as not to incense Nicks. The alternate mixes and takes (more phaser! Less Dobro! Take 22!), by the time you make it to disc four, just underscore the fact that Rumours did not hatch as a pristine whole. One does not need three variously funky articulations of Christine's burning ""Keep Me There"" to comprehend this. Nevertheless, it is difficult not to buy into the mythology of Rumours both as an album and pop culture artifact: a flawless record pulled from the wreckage of real lives. As one of classic rock's foundational albums, it holds up better than any other commercial smash of that ilk (Hotel California, certainly). We can now use it as a kind of nostalgic benchmark-- that they don't make groups like that anymore, that there is no rock band so palatable that it could be the best-selling album in the U.S. for 31 weeks. Things work differently now. Examined from that angle, Rumours was not exactly a game changer, it was merely perfect.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17499-rumours/,"Rhino,Warner Bros.,Rhino,Warner Bros.",1977.0
201,Miles Davis,"The Bootleg Series, Volume 2: Live in Europe 1969",Jazz,9.0,January 31 2013,Hank Shteamer,Contributor,"""It was really a bad motherfucker,"" Miles Davis wrote in his autobiography of the live band he led in 1969. With somewhat less panache, Davis completists have pegged the group the Lost Quintet, since, unlike the two longstanding Davis five-pieces that preceded it, this one never made a proper studio recording. All of the members-- saxophonist Wayne Shorter, keyboardist Chick Corea, bassist Dave Holland and drummer Jack DeJohnette-- appear on 1970's landmark Bitches Brew and other scattered sessions from the time, but only as part of larger ensembles; until now, if you wanted to hear them as a stripped-down unit, you had to consult imports, bootlegs and YouTube. This second installment in the Miles Davis Bootleg Series, which follows an excellent 2011 set focusing on the trumpeter's prior working band, gives us three complete Lost Quintet gigs, plus the majority of a fourth, on three CDs and one DVD. It's a real trove, and not just because this lineup is relatively obscure. In a very clear way, the Lost Quintet is the pivot point between the two main phases of Miles' 40-plus-year career: the acoustic jazz idiom he inhabited, and eventually revolutionized, from the mid-'40s through the late '60s, and the plugged-in ensembles he would lead until his death in 1991. In other words, if you've ever wondered exactly how the dapper jazzman of Kind of Blue morphed into a loudly attired icon in wraparound shades, this set offers some crucial clues. When we last left Miles, on The Bootleg Series, Volume 1, he was leading the world's most advanced and telepathic acoustic jazz group (the so-called Second Great Quintet); by the time of the gigs on Live in Europe 1969, Miles was straddling the fault line. He had already traded acoustic piano for overdriven electric keys and had begun taking rhythmic and textural cues from contemporary funk, but he hadn't yet entered his psychedelic-groove-machine phase in earnest. (For an early taste of the latter, try the 2001 Miles archival release Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970): It's About that Time, which features Shorter, Corea, Holland-- who had switched to electric bass in the interim-- and DeJohnette, as well as percussionist Airto Moreira.) Unlike the groups that succeeded it, the Lost Quintet shared a significant portion of its DNA with the acoustic, jazz-centric Miles ensembles that came before. This is especially apparent on the first two sets here: good-sounding, often-bootlegged performances recorded over successive July nights at the 1969 Juan-les-Pins Jazz Festival in Antibes, France. The scope of these concerts is remarkable. You hear pieces from the yet-unrecorded Bitches Brew (""Spanish Key,"" ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down""); a track from the ethereal masterpiece In a Silent Way (""It's About That Time""), recorded that past February but not yet released; staples of the Second Great Quintet repertoire (including ""Masqualero"" and ""Footprints,"" both by Shorter, the sole holdover from that band); and themes Miles had favored since the late 50s (""Milestones,"" ""Round Midnight"")-- all flowing together in the expertly paced suites that were Miles' onstage trademark. But the repertoire is only half of the story; as always with Miles groups, the personnel is the thing. Like the members of the Second Great Quintet, these musicians, aside from the relatively unknown Holland, were already rising or established stars when Miles recruited them. They make for a deadly team, equally at home with low-down groove, in-the-pocket swing and feverish abstraction. The group displays its raucous intensity right from the start of the first Antibes set. During opener ""Directions,"" Corea, Holland and DeJohnette send some serious whitewater their boss's way, in the form of a near-chaotic proto-breakbeat. Miles responds with a brief but explosive solo, full of blaring peaks and bravura runs. If drummer Tony Williams was the chief upsetter in the Second Great Quintet-- furnishing near-constant turbulence to the delight of his employer-- the entire rhythm section takes on that role in the Lost Quintet. When Davis isn't playing, they get straight-up Dionysian. The night-two version of ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down"" starts off as crackling uptempo funk. But following Shorter's solo, Corea and Holland engage in a free-form duel between bleepy keyboard and scratchy bowed bass that rivals Sun Ra's freakiest excursions. Here you can hear Corea-- who has gone on record saying he distrusted the electric piano when Miles first suggested he play it-- forgetting about technique and reveling in an alien sound palette. The band isn't just about disruption. The versions of familiar pieces like ""Footprints"" and ""Round Midnight,"" both from from the first Antibes set, feature bashing DeJohnette crescendos and bracingly gritty Shorter solos, but they also demonstrate the band's knack for extraordinarily supple, dynamically controlled swing. A brief Miles/Corea duet on ""I Fall in Love Too Easily,"" from night two, is another shrewd pace-changer. On The Bootleg Series, Volume 1, Miles and Herbie Hancock introduce this same piece as an unaccompanied duo, but here, Corea's electric piano lends it a newly dreamlike aura. In retrospect, this interlude plays like a stealthy sneak preview of In a Silent Way's proto-ambient brain massage; like the versions of Shorter's ""Sanctuary"" that close each Antibes set, it's part jazz balladry, part immersive soundscape. The material on disc three, portions of two sets from November 5 in Stockholm, contrasts nicely with the fierce, sprawling Antibes shows. Because of an electric-piano malfunction, Corea plays acoustic piano for most of the first set, a swap that has a major effect on the group dynamic. This performance has its dark, unruly moments, including an early take on the ominous title track of Bitches Brew, recorded that past August but not yet released, but overall, it's a surprisingly tame outing. The version of Shorter's ""Nefertiti"" sounds both elegant and almost quaint, about as close as the Lost Quintet ever came to jazz orthodoxy. The one sample we get of the second Stockholm set offers a tantalizing contrast: a rare take on ""This"", a Corea composition which the pianist had first recorded in May of '69 with a band that included both Holland and DeJohnette. After a brief group theme statement-- with Corea back on electric piano-- the ensemble embarks on a series of atomized improvisations, including a dense Davis/DeJohnette face-off and a pointillist Shorter/Holland/DeJohnette excursion. This single track, possibly the most concentrated example on record of a Miles Davis group playing free jazz, demonstrates how the members of the Lost Quintet spurred the leader toward the avant-garde even as they helped him achieve a deeper engagement with funk and psychedelia. The DVD, containing a complete Berlin concert from November 7, is essential; the clarity and intimacy of this pristine multicamera document should assure that no one ever again pegs this band as obscure. The in-progress shift in Miles' aesthetic, already apparent in the music, is right there to behold in the men's dress: Whereas the Second Great Quintet always turned up in black tie, the Lost Quintet looks like it's fresh from a Williamsburg vintage shop. (Holland's ensemble—a cow-skin-pattern vest over a purple sweatsuit—is either a facepalmer or a triumph, depending on your tastes.) The band takes a while to warm up here, turning in an unusually subdued ""Directions."" But by a mid-set ""It's About That Time,"" the feral magic is back; Shorter's brilliantly jittery, speaking-in-tongues soprano solo and a low-volume, high-intensity free-improv duet between Corea and a mallets-wielding DeJohnette make this piece one of the highlights of the entire box set. Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette eventually left Miles' band in turn, and Davis began constructing the psych-funk juggernaut heard on records like 1974's aptly titled Dark Magus. As Miles outfitted his trumpet with a wah-wah effect, enlisted a phalanx of guitars and began doubling on organ, the atmosphere thickened and the grooves grew more colossal, but the trumpeter would never again lead a group as thrillingly virtuosic and diabolically mutable as the Lost Quintet. (It's a testament to Miles' eye for talent that Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette still rank among the most popular and esteemed jazz musicians on earth; Shorter's current working quartet, heard on the new Blue Note release Without a Net, exemplifies a volatility that's directly traceable to the Lost Quintet.) That fact is now duly noted in the official record, thanks to this set-- a bad motherfucker in its own right.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17676-the-bootleg-series-volume-2-live-in-europe-1969/,"Columbia,Legacy",2013.0
202,Nas,Illmatic,Rap,10.0,January 23 2013,Jeff Weiss,Contributor,"You hear the arthritic rumble of the train. The 100-ton iron horse clacking at 55 miles per hour through the tunnel to nowhere. Stainless steel cars bombed with balloon letters in bubble gum paint. The F Line, pre-Giuliani, packed with rats and villains, foreigners and flummoxed out-of-towners, beggars, bandits, and sweating working stiffs. Third rails everywhere. It stops at 21st street. Queensbridge exit. The doors crumple open and the passengers vanish up half-lit stairwells into the Bridge. There is no Illmatic without the Bridge. Illmatic is the bridge. Queensbridge Houses, the largest projects in America, brick buildings dun as dead leaves, a six-block maze clotted with 7,000-plus trying to survive. The pissy elevators only stop on every other floor. The neighbors are the rotting East River and the ""Big Alice"" power plant, its smokestacks hacking up black clouds. The Bridge is where Nas was raised. He explained the mentality to The Source in April 1994, the same month Illmatic was instantly canonized with a perfect 5-Mic score: ""When I was a kid I just stayed in the projects… that shit is like a city. Everybody's mentality revolves around the projects. Everybody's gotta eat. It's just the attitude out there, it's just life. You can't be no sucker."" Illmatic starts with that rumbling of the train. A VHS snippet from Wild Style immediately snarls, ""Stop fucking around and be a man!"" You hear a cassette tape hissing the verse from teenaged Nasty Nas on Main Source's ""Live at the BBQ,"" 1991: ""When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus."" He anointed himself the ""street's disciple."" Everyone blessed him as the Golden Child. The track shifts to ""The Subway Theme"" from Wild Style, hip-hop's first creation myth, the 1983 film that exposed the routines of the South Bronx to the rest of the world. Nas calls his version ""The Genesis"", fusing his own story of origin with the culture. His brother Jungle snaps, ""yo, Nas, what the fuck is this bullshit?"" Nas tells him to chill. He's carrying on tradition, defined as: ""When it's real, you do it even without a recording contract."" It's an oath of purity amidst poisons-- something that seems sanctimonious in a post-Puffy world, but it assured the older gods that they would have a stake in the next generation. He was the spawn of the Wild Style, the first great to grow up with Park Jams as his earliest memories. I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times. Hip-hop was a teenager when Illmatic dropped*.* Old enough for biblical foundation, but young enough to be embroiled in an early identity crisis. The Columbia press sheet that accompanies it opens: ""While it's sad that there's so much frontin' in the rap world today, this should only make us sit up and pay attention when a rapper comes along who's not about milking the latest trend and running off with the loot."" New York street culture was losing its birthright to hip-hop's evolution. Death Row and West Coast gangsta rap dominated the charts and mass media oxygen. Rap-A-Lot was carving up its empire in the South. It was after Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, and leather-suited rappers wanted that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze money. Big Daddy Kane was firmly in the silken post-Madonna Sex book era. LL Cool J was mugging with a red beret in Toys. Even a young RZA and GZA got bamboozled into goofy New Jack Swing jams by clueless executives. And Nas couldn't get a record deal. This sounds insane in hindsight. When people start making greatest rapper lists you can't count to five before Nas' name is mentioned. The kid who went to hell for snuffing Jesus has become a sacred cow. Twenty years deep, he's nominated for a Grammy and is in Gap ads with his dad. There was the album with Damian Marley, the feud with Jay-Z, there was Belly. Nas is firmly entrenched in VH1 Special territory. He has crossed over enough without ever making radio hits, save for ""Oochie Wally"", in which he is out-rapped by his bodyguard-- all for oochie. But Def Jam's Russell Simmons passed on the demo, famously claiming that Nas sounded too much like Queensbridge machine gun, Kool G Rap. Translation: great but unsalable. He signed Warren G instead, who went triple platinum in the summer and fall of 1994. Illmatic only sold 330,000 copies in its first year. It has no ""Regulate"" that can inspire drunken Nate Dogg sing-a-longs, but it is widely regarded as the greatest East Coast rap album ever made. Illmatic is the gold standard that boom-bap connoisseurs refer to in the same way that Baby Boomers talk about Highway 61 Revisited. The evidence they point to when they want to say: this is how good it can be. I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death. The enduring vision of Nas: a baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. The only light is the orange glow of a blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation. Sometimes his pen taps the paper and his brain blanks. In the next sentence, he remembers dark streets and the noose. The phrases and images are so deeply rooted in rap consciousness to have become cliché. Over the last 19 years, a million secret handshakes and scratched hooks have been executed to lines from Illmatic: I woke up early on my born day; I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi 'til I'm charged; you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer, that's like Malcolm X catching jungle fever; I'm an addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha, and bitches with beepers; vocabulary spills, I'm ill; life's a bitch and then you die. Removed from context, they seem unremarkable. When spit with criminal smoothness over beat breaks, they became iconic. If Rakim was rap's Woody Guthrie, Nas was the Dylan figure expanding the possibilities and complexity of the form, twisting old fables to match contemporary failings, faithful to tradition but unwilling to submit to orthodoxy. Illmatic was the bridge. Melle Mel and Kurtis Blow, to Run-DMC, to Rakim, the Juice Crew, and Big Daddy Kane. Now Nas. Everyone said he had next since Large Professor brought the chipped tooth kid sporting Gazelles into the studio. His arrival was a communal effort. After MC Serch discovered he was unsigned, he landed him a deal at Columbia Records. When Nas summoned beats, he was laced with jewels from the city's best producers: DJ Premier, Pete Rock, the Large Professor, and Q-Tip. Regional demand was so high that Serch claimed he discovered a garage with 60,000 bootlegged copies. The brief length (10 tracks, 39:51) was due to this rush to get to market. It also left less room for error. There are many albums with higher highs than Illmatic, but none with fewer flaws. The sequencing is perfect down to ""Halftime"" ending as the cassette tape clicked. It's as dense and claustrophobic as Queensbridge, but blood simple. The verses sprint around blind corners and the hooks are hypnotic chants: New York State of Mind, One Love, It's Half Time, The World is Yours, Coming Out of Queensbridge, Represent. A classic album is supposed to change or define its time. Illmatic did both. The Notorious B.I.G. borrowed everything from art ideas to album structure. It was so blatant that Ghostface and Raekwon dedicated an entire skit to mocking it. Jay-Z took a hot Nas line and made a hot song on Reasonable Doubt. If you listen to Sean Carter before Illmatic, the rat-a-tat is straight from Big Daddy Kane. After Nas dropped, Jay-Z suddenly got smooth. Those are just the two most famous appropriations. No album better reflected the sound and style of New York, 94. The alembic of soul jazz samples, SP-1200s, broken nose breaks, and raw rap distilled the Henny, no chaser ideal of boom-bap. The loops rummage through their parent's collection: Donald Byrd, Joe Chambers, Ahmad Jamal, Parliament, Michael Jackson. Nas invites his rolling stone father, Olu Dara to blow the trumpet coda on ""Life's A Bitch"". Jazz-rap fusion had been done well prior, but rarely with such subtlety. Nas didn't need to make the connection explicit-- he allowed you to understand what jazz was like the first time your parents and grandparents heard it. I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane. None of this context has to matter. Illmatic is imprisoned within itself. The power is targeted in the narrow scope of its worldview. There are six desperate and savage blocks and there is nowhere else. Nas captures the feeling of being young and trapped. You see his struggle and you see his ghosts. The more I listen to Illmatic, the more haunted it feels. When you're younger, it clubs you with its hail of words and the skeletal beauty of its beats. But the older I get, the more it strikes me as a teenaged requiem for those still living. ""Old Soul"" is the sort of stock phrase used by yoga teachers and amateur psychics, but it always fit Nas. He's 20 and prematurely nostalgic, struck by memories of park jams and watching ""CHiPS."", when Shante dissed the real Roxanne, and how much he misses Mr. Magic. There is no narrative about Ill Will, but you hear the name over and over. Will was his best friend and first music partner who lived on the 6th floor with turntables and a mic. He was shot to death in Queensbridge over a drunken argument. You don't hear how Nas and his wounded brother Jungle rushed Will to the hospital, got static from emergency room officials, and watched him die. But the sense of grievous loss shadows almost every bar, especially ""Memory Lane"" and ""One Love"". If you listen to it enough names start to pop out: Fatcat, Alpo, Grand Wizard, Mayo, the foul cop who shot Garcia, Jerome's niece, Little Rob, Herb, Ice, and Bullet. The entirety of ""Represent"". You start to wonder where they are now, or if they are. The album's lone guest AZ, lays it down flat: he's destined to live the dream for all the peeps who never made it. But Nas uses Illmatic as more than a vehicle to escape. The styles and stories that formed him fuse into something that withstands outdated slang and popular taste: it is a story of a gifted writer born into squalor, trying to claw his way out of the trap. It's somewhere between The Basketball Diaries and Native Son, but Jim Carroll and Richard Wright couldn't rap like Nas. That's why 19 years later, Get On Down is re-issuing a box set with a vinyl, gold CD, and an ersatz cherry wood case featuring a 48-page book with The Source article that originally crowned him-- even if Illmatic was the archetypal cassette album (along with the purple tape). It's best heard by ignoring the dogma, culture wars, Nas clones, and would-be saviors that have accreted since April of 1994. Who cares whether it's the greatest rap album of all-time or not? It's an example of how great rap can be, but not necessarily the way it should be. There was no real follow-up to Illmatic because Nas understood that he'd tapped into a moment that could only come once and in one place. This is what things had been building towards. A little over a decade later, Nas claimed that hip-hop was dead, but this world that was his was already starting to vanish on Illmatic. But you can still summon it from the first rumble of the train. This is what happened when the doors opened.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17497-illmatic/,"Get on Down,Get on Down",1994.0
203,Amy Winehouse,At The BBC,Pop/R&B,3.1,December 11 2012,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"Everybody wants a new Amy Winehouse album as good as Back to Black. It would be nice if, for instance, it turned out that the British soul revivalist had completed or at least sketched out another jewel of a record during the turbulent last four years of her life. But she didn't: there was her collaboration with Mark Ronson on ""Valerie"", and the new song-and-a-half that turned up on last year's Lioness: Hidden Treasures, which was otherwise stocked with alternate versions, earlier outtakes, and covers. A live album that lived up to what she could do at her best would be welcome, too. But her post-Back to Black gigs were relatively few and, by all accounts, mostly pretty dodgy. So-- perhaps a set of radio recordings, then? That's something, right? At the BBC cherrypicks 48 minutes' worth of tracks from live-on-stage and live-in-the-studio broadcasts. It adds two otherwise unreleased titles to the Winehouse discography: covers of the standards ""I Should Care"" and ""Lullaby of Birdland"", from the latter of which Winehouse borrowed a bit for her own ""October Song"". And it's sequenced in order of her albums' original release rather than in order of the performances-- all the Frank songs, then all the Back to Black songs, then the other stuff. That covers up for the fact that only two tracks here were recorded in the rocky 2007-2011 period: a blaring ""Just Friends"" and a stripped-down ""Love Is a Losing Game"", both from 2009. It also provides an excuse to lead the album with a 2004 take of ""Know You Now"" that's a marked improvement on the Frank recording. Winehouse always had a tendency to over sing on stage, though. Especially when she had a big audience to project toward, it was too easy for her to overindulge in the vocal tics-- the slurred consonants, the hyper-articulated melisma, the extravagant ornaments, the imitations of Billie Holiday's timbre-- that she could restrain on her better studio recordings, and it often led her to mangle her own lyrics. (She pronounces the final word of ""F%#k Me Pumps"" here as ""pwuuuups."") The most effective performances here are the most intimate ones, especially on the attached DVD-- an hour-long documentary built around a 22-minute set filmed shortly after the release of Back to Black, just Winehouse, a guitarist and a bassist playing inside a little Irish church. The versions of Winehouse's repertoire that turn up on At the BBC's audio disc, though, are almost all sloppier than their studio counterparts, and she rarely manages to reveal anything we didn't already know about her songs. And every time she garbles a phrase or pointedly mentions her vices, it's a stinging reminder that she spent the better part of her too-brief career making her audience complicit in her self-destruction.Â This set isn't devoid of interest, but it's not in any way another great Amy Winehouse album, or even another good one. We're never going to get that.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17295-at-the-bbc/,Interscope,2012.0
204,Soundgarden,King Animal,Rock,5.9,November 16 2012,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Of all the grunge bands that went multi-platinum in the 1990s, Soundgarden pulled it off with the least amount of drama or fall-out. No antagonistic relationships with the media, no publicized addictions, no scandals, no suicides. Their legacy is instead one of hard work, perseverance, and pragmatism; after all, Soundgarden had already embraced the benefits of signing to a major label several years before Kurt Cobain had developed a self-loathing attitude about doing the same. Even the band's dissolution in 1997 was less of a bombshell than a simple product of boredom with the biz. So it follows that the band's recent reunion has a par-for-the-course, procedural air: Soundgarden are back together and making new music because, well, that's what dormant alt-rock institutions are supposed to do now, right? Even the band's would-be comeback coronation, King Animal's ""Been Away Too Long"", is less a statement of celebration than obligation, the titular declaration undercut by Chris Cornell's admission that ""I never really wanted to stay."" Still, the return of Soundgarden is something to get excited about, if only because it momentarily delays the release of another Cornell solo album. And fortunately, the singer's interim attempts to reinvent himself -- as a Jeff Buckley-esque crooner, Timbaland's favorite mobile-phone pitchman, and wet-blanket warbler for a squandered hard-rock supergroup opportunity-- have little bearing on the outcome of King Animal. However, your enthusiasm for this album will ultimately depend on how often you return to 1996's Down on the Upside, an album that scored the band another platinum disc to hang in their bathrooms but felt like a holding pattern after the impressive four-album progression charted from 1988's sludgy Ultramega OK to 1994's steely Superunknown. On the latter album, Soundgarden got their formula of muscular hard rock, brooding, psychedelic power ballads, and acoustic mysticism down to an exact science, and Upside simply repeated those same moves to slightly diminished returns. (Consider how the surreal, bad-trip Beatleisms of Superunknown's ""Black Hole Sun"" got processed into the melodramatic and obvious ""Blow Up the Outside World."") Now, imagine that same formula rehashed and diluted even more and you've got King Animal. The result is all the more disappointing given a strong start that showcases the band's regained command of rhythm and ballast. ""Non-State Actor"" grooves menacingly like a funkier ""Spoonman"", while the album's hands-down standout, ""By Crooked Steps"", reminds us that Soundgarden is at its best when making Ben Shepherd and Matt Cameron's stuttering time signatures, Kim Thayil's contorted riffage, and Cornell's glass-shattering wail sound like perfectly natural FM-radio fodder. From there, the band simmer down into moodier, mid-tempo realms-- minus the skyscraping, MTV-baiting hooks that once allowed them to mellow out without boring the mosh pit. And after a while, you get the sense that Soundgarden are checking boxes off on a list: ""Bones of Birds"" is the ""Black Hole""-sized psychedelic centerpiece that boasts an affective, downcast riff from Thayil, but is bogged down by an undercooked, overwrought chorus. And there are two attempts -- back-to-back, no less -- at a congenial, acoustic-strummed exercise a la ""Burden in My Hand"" (""Black Saturday"" and ""Halfway There""), but without the anthemic refrains to put them over the top. Likewise, the rare excursions outside their classic-rockin' comfort zone lead to dead ends, as when the dubby outro on ""Worse Dreams"" shoots for trippy, free-form chaos but winds up an aimless, uneventful mess. The autopilot nature of King Animal's second half is perfectly summed up by the repeated chain-gang chant of the closing ""Rowing"": ""Don't know where I'm going/ I just keep on rowing/ I just keep on pulling/ Gotta row."" King Animal makes for a respectable display of Soundgarden's proficiency, but lacks their once-imposing majesty. Listening to the record, it's easy to forget what a disorienting, brutalizing effect songs like ""Rusty Cage"" and ""Jesus Christ Pose"" had on the early-90s rock landscape, even after Nirvana had nudged post-hardcore-schooled noise to the right of the dial. And in the decade and a half that Soundgarden were out of commission, there have been many art-metal aspirants-- from the Deftones and Queens of the Stone Age to Mastodon and Boris-- who've aimed for a similar balance of brains and brawn. The best hope for King Animal was that Soundgarden would be inspired enough by their spiritual successors to want to outdo them, and set a new benchmark for ambitious aggression. Instead, the group's first album since 1996 just sounds like the one they would've churned out in 1998.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17300-king-animal/,"Republic,Seven Four",2012.0
205,Joni Mitchell,The Studio Albums 1968-1979,Rock,8.0,November 9 2012,Jessica Hopper,Contributor,"Joni Mitchell once called fame ""a glamorous misunderstanding."" As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women. Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry). Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, Song to a Seagull, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. Clouds (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds casual. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, Clouds was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance. Ladies of the Canyon from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. Ladies also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. The genius of Ladies is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If Ladies does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and Ladies' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. About that follow-up: 1971's Blue is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album. ""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued Blue, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's For the Roses. Up until Roses she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with Roses--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist. Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, Roses' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered. Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were unrelated to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On Roses, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers. Her 1974 commercial break-out, Court and Spark, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. Court is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, Court has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her The Hissing of Summer Lawns was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a betrayal-- we must first look at the run up. While promoting Court, what could easily be defined as the commercial and artistic high-water mark of her career, Mitchell went to go see Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up joining. At the time, she was a peer of Dylan, commercially and as a songwriter, she was also tight with tour member Robbie Robertson of the Band. She had a song in the Billboard Top 10-- and she was opening. When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. Through all of this she arrived at Hissing of Summer Lawns. The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a serious musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as Blue, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from Court. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; Hissing is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece."" And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise."" Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album Miles of Aisles attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. Hissing was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in. The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. Hejira, from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as Blue. It's a real grown woman album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion. Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album Don Juan's Reckless Daughter in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is solidly jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, Mingus, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well. Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's Both Sides Now, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/,"Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino,Rhino",2012.0
206,Kendrick Lamar,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",Rap,9.5,October 23 2012,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"The first sound we hear on good kid, m.A.A.d. city is a prayer: ""Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving us with your precious blood,"" voices murmur, evoking a family dinner gathering. The album's cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby Kendrick dangles off an uncle's knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamar's baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rapper's inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the album's calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamar's childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him. Lamar has subtitled the record ""A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar"", and the comparison rings true: You could take the album's outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick ""with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental,"" driving his mother's van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: ""It's deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb,"" he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the album's structure: Kendrick's mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that good kid, m.A.A.d city is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this album's world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him. All this weighty material might make good kid, m.A.A.d city sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when ""Backseat Freestyle"" leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter (""All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower"") took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendrick's character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his ""damn, I got bitches"" chant gets turned inside out: This isn't an alpha male's boast. It's a pipsqueak's first pass at a chest-puff. It's also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices (in double- and triple-time, no less) over an insane Hit-Boy beat. Lamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this album's edges, casting shadows on Kendrick's complicated relationship with his hometown. When ""The Art of Peer Pressure"" brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to hallowed ground. Ice Cube’s “Bird in the Hand” is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” (“Fresh of out school, 'cause I was a high-school grad...""), which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts. Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: ""I made a promise to see you bleeding,"" he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Compton's Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, ""Wake yo' punk ass up,"" like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety. Which brings us to the album's most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendrick's rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamar's story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample (""Poetic Justice"") into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dre's appearance, on the final track ""Compton"", that feels like an uneasy outlier. ""Compton"" is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement ""Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst"", in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the album's most dazzling stroke of empathy, it can't help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artist's story is always less interesting than their journey, and there's a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blaze's blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dre's music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain Truman Show feel to it. But the true ending of good kid, m.A.A.d. city takes place at the end of the previous song, ""Real"", which represents the spiritual victory that the album's story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that ""none of that shit""-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- ""make me real,"" Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the album's central concerns to bed: ""Any nigga can kill a man,"" his father admonishes. ""That don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family."" And his mother: ""If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And that's the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick.""",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/,"Interscope,Aftermath,Top Dawg",2012.0
207,Lil Wayne,Dedication 4,Rap,5.0,September 10 2012,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"The Dedication mixtapes have reliably served as a barometer of Lil Wayne's creative fire: On 2, he was a determined kid busily fulfilling his own ""best rapper alive"" prophecy. On 3, he was skidding dangerously post-Carter III, whacked out on codeine and sounding frayed. Dedication 4, for its part, is the clearest transmission yet of a message he's been sending for a while: He'd rather not to be rapping anymore. From a beat selection so obvious that the word ""selection"" feels generous to Wayne's recycled punch lines to his unimaginative rhyme patterns, the mixtape is joyless clock-punching work from a rapper who has given some indications he doesn't even like his own music as much anymore. But a career's a career, and when you've gotten this famous, you don't just stop, even if maybe you'd prefer to. This is the spirit Dedication 4 comes to us in: Somehow, I don't think this is what 2005 Wayne meant when he promised us he'd only retire when he died. Not many rappers bother with this format anymore, in which a rapper flexes skill over a tape full of borrowed beats to point out how much better they are than the rappers that paid for them. Nonetheless, this is the sort of mixtape that elevated Wayne from ""famous rapper"" to ""legendary rapper."" His freestyles over beats like ""Show Me What You Got"" and ""Shoulder Lean"" have become classics on their own. By contrast, Dedication 4 is a game of rap karaoke. The beats he raps over-- ""Same Damn Tune"", ""Burn"", ""Mercy"", ""Don't Like"", ""Amen""-- are so ubiquitous that every rapper in the world looking for a quick SEO boost has spit some bars over them. Worse, Wayne falls immediately into the song's preexisting rhyme pattern, offering nothing to distract you from its source material: For a rapper so famous for stealing-- and murdering-- beats, the worst I can say about Dedication 4 is that there isn't one moment where I wouldn't rather be listening to the often mediocre originals. There are a dozen or so good punch lines scattered on D4, enough to make it fun enough for one listen: a good ""Jack Black/Jack White"" joke on ""Magic"", a ""straitjacket/straight jack it"" pun on ""Burn"". On ""Cashed Out"", he neatly unites his well-documented Gremlins fixation to his sex fixation with the line, ""That pussy so wet, it turned into a Gremlin."" Wayne doesn't sound depressed or detached here; he's still having fun, collapsing into giggles after dropping the Larry-the-Cable-Guy-worthy ""I would talk about my dick/ But that shit would be a long story."" He just sounds uninspired, and in need of a new style. There are two surprising moments on Dedication 4: One is Nicki Minaj's hilarious faux-Romney endorsement on ""Mercy"" (if Minaj were actually to offer a Romney endorsement, I don't think the straight-faced line, ""I'm a Republican, voting for Mitt Romney,"" on a Lil Wayne mixtape would be her method). The other is when G Dep's ""Special Delivery"", of all things, shows up late on the mixtape. ""I don't even like this beat,"" Wayne mumbles playfully, before slipping in one of the tape's liveliest verses, dancing in and out of double time. It's one of the only verses that doesn't feel like a minimally tweaked update on something he said in 2007. Wayne has admitted lately that he's bored with rapping, reasonably pointing out, ""I've been doing it since I was eight and I'm about to be 30 in September... I think fans deserve a little-to-no Wayne. I've been everywhere."" He's right. Let's hope Dedication 4 is the last we hear from Wayne for a while: We can wait until he has something to say before he approaches a mic again.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17159-dedication-4/,Young Money Entertainment,2012.0
208,Nas,Life Is Good,Rap,8.3,July 20 2012,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Nas has been disappointing people nearly half his life. By now, the passion play of raised and swiftly dashed hopes that occurs whenever he announces a new album has repeated itself enough times to officially qualify as farce. You'd think he'd be exhausted by now, and there were times over his last three sleepwalking efforts when he sounded just that: a guy wearily familiar with his own towering mythology, and increasingly disinterested in living up to it. But what if Nas stopped fretting about blowing people's minds or disappointing them and just, you know, made a record? It's the kind of question Nas devotees have spent years pondering, and Life Is Good, his 10th studio album and strongest in three or four presidential administrations, is basically the answer. Song for song, it's his most solid, disaster-free album since, well... we won't go there, as comparing Nas albums is like comparing birthdays where your father showed up late instead of not at all. But for once, Nas sidesteps oblivion. Life Is Good finds him avoiding most of his worst impulses, scraping the pseudo-mystical Righteous Teacher patina off his crown and touching back down in the Queensbridge of his sense memory over late-summer-light production. Life Is Good is so consistent, in fact, that it's disorienting, and those of us with a long history navigating Nas albums will have a lot of pressing questions: What are all these top-shelf beats doing here? Where are the queasy sex jams, the songs rapped from the perspective of heroin spoons or discarded E&J bottles, the choruses about being a Warrior and a Hero? Where is the blindingly ill-fitting Nas Radio Bid? (The lone example, the Swizz Beatz-produced ""Summer on Smash"", is just inoffensively generic.) But above all: What happened this time? Part of the answer is clear. The last few years have been turbulent ones in Nas' personal life -- his brutally public split with Kelis, the costly settlement, the embarrassing fiasco with his teenage daughter tweeting pictures of a bejeweled box of condoms in her bedroom. Historically at his best when shaken, Nas has rich material to work with here, and he's more open-hearted on Life Is Good than he has been since God's Son. ""Daughters"", his sweetly reflective response to the condom-gate that is no less sweet for its slight lyrical awkwardness (he refers to what is presumably Twitter just as ""the social network""), finds him examining the responsibilities of fatherhood with fond bewilderment. The song aimed directly at Kelis (""Bye Baby""), meanwhile, is more a good-times remembrance than score-settling. ""You screamin' at the racist cops in Miami was probably the highlight of my life,"" he recalls, the affection audible in his voice. It's also entirely possible that Nas fans have No I.D. to thank for Life Is Good's quality. In the recent Complex cover story on Nas, I.D. said that he ""wanted to make a soundtrack that allowed Nas to be Nas."" Mentor to Kanye, a Chicago rap veteran, and the current executive vice president at Def Jam, No I.D. seems to be cementing his role as the Rap Whisperer: He recently guided a deeply confused Common to his first good record in nine years, and it's likely he exercised some of the same gentle-but-firm guidance here. He produces five of 14 tracks on Life is Good, and they all exude the warm TV-fireplace crackle of the best throwback production. You can feel the July city-heat sweat drip off the wooly saxophone on ""Stay"", while ""Back When"" flickers like a dim neon sign. The lyrics to ""Back When"" don't even do much besides gesture at Nas' musty mythology: ""check out the oracle bred by city housing,"" Hollis Ave, Shan, and Marley, ""you love to hear the story of how it all got started,"" etc. But he breathes through it with old-Shakespearean-actor fondness-- he was, after all, there, and No I.D. provides just the right lighting. The rest of the production list reads as if it were crowd-sourced by exacting Nas purists: Buckwild, Salaam Remi, the late Heavy D (who gave Nas ""The Don"" before he passed away). Remi's blaring beat for ""A Queens Story"" is like a louder, more dramatic version of ""Get Down"", its tension ratcheted up by James Bond-theme horn blurts. There are a couple of playful, possibly shameless nods to Illmatic: On the intro to ""Loco-Motive"", a suspiciously familiar-sounding subway train rolls over tracks in the distance. Nas dedicates the song to ""my trapped in the 90s niggas,"" a line that could be used against him but that sounds, in the album's context, like playfulness. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle, or age backwards, but you can settle gracefully into strengths. Nas isn't back; he's just here.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16832-life-is-good/,Def Jam,2012.0
209,Frank Ocean,Channel Orange,Pop/R&B,9.5,July 12 2012,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"Frank Ocean is airborne, looking around, taking it all in. ""Up above the birds, I saw the sky like I never seen before,"" he whispers on his major-label debut, Channel Orange, as avian chirps surround him. ""You thought I was above you."" The 24-year-old has quickly proven himself to be among the most gifted singer-songwriters of his generation; he's got the type of voice, wit, charm, smarts, and ineffable humanity that's always hoped for, but never promised. And he's got every reason to think he's above the vividly realized lost souls that slouch, preen, and weep throughout his album. But that's not how Frank Ocean works. His lofty gaze is powerful, but not all-powerful. ""What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?"" he sang on Watch the Throne's ""No Church in the Wild"". He's so good at questioning that answers can't help but bubble up in the wake of his words. Along with Ocean's empathy for his characters is a sense of repose-- he's been there, he's weathered it, and he's come away with his Zen-like calm intact. On Channel Orange, this serene deadpan is splashed with crackling emotion, as though he's alternately narrating and starring in his own Magnolia-style cross-wired-heartbreak epic. It's all there on proper opener ""Thinkin Bout You"", where he battles his own brain while reminiscing about a first love. He tells himself white lies in the verse before flipping to a falsetto that could make D'Angelo sweat for the endless wound of a chorus: ""Do you not think so far ahead?/ Cause I've been thinkin bout forever."" When Ocean dropped an early take of ""Thinkin Bout You"" on his Tumblr last summer, it was quickly followed by a version from perfectly competent Roc Nation signee Bridget Kelly, who claimed Ocean originally wrote the song for her. The fact that Ocean's take dwarfs Kelly's both artistically as well as in terms of popularity is telling. After languishing as a behind-the-scenes writer for pop stars including Brandy, John Legend, and Justin Bieber, with ""Thinkin Bout You"" Ocean doubled down on the out-of-nowhere success of his unique and brilliant 2011 mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra., marking his territory as a performer in his own right. And while he's now primarily writing songs for himself, his time toiling in L.A. studios gave him the experience to create a piece as accomplished and varied as Channel Orange, which swings from Stevie-style keyboard breeziness to 1990s bap&B to mystic psych rock to crunching 8-bit funk without thinking twice. The ""Thinkin Bout You"" mix-up was telling for another reason, too. As written, it's by-and-large a unisex composition, and the line, ""my eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when I'm thinkin bout you,"" didn't seem especially revealing since Ocean wrote the song for a woman. In light of the letter he published earlier this month, in which he stated that his first love, at age 19, was with a man, that line-- and others on the album-- gains some personal and historical context. For a culture that accurately prides itself on sonic progression, hip-hop and R&B can be woefully conservative when it comes to sexuality. This is changing, and Frank Ocean is helping it to change, and if his revelation inspires others to understand themselves or the world more fully, then that could be one of Channel Orange's finest legacies. But it will not be the album's only legacy. Aside from its bravery, Ocean's letter was, in itself, stunningly written. Its beautiful ambiguities had people reacting with sensational headlines, and then amending those sensational headlines, and then thinking about how and why they personally reacted to such sensational headlines. More questions; more answers. After realizing he was in love with a man, Ocean ""reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager. the ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realized they were written in a language I did not yet speak."" And, whether consciously or not, Channel Orange's language is admirably-- and skillfully-- inclusive. Rather than getting listeners to comb through the lyrics for certain words or references, Ocean mixes things up so well-- and coats the entire affair with heavy doses of disorienting surreality-- that petty pronoun policing is rendered completely useless as deeper meanings reveal themselves at the same time. While pop is currently in the golden age of exacting self-reflection-- an often beguiling phenomenon spurred on by the internet's infinite mirror-- Ocean is interested in a more selfless pursuit. ""As a lifestyle, you always being the focal point is innately unhealthy,"" Ocean recently told The New York Times. ""I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films. Even though it's my voice, I'm a storyteller."" Those tales are as wide-ranging as they are engrossing, always benefitting from Ocean's eye for detail and specificity. There are sly California class observations in the vein of Joan Didion or Randy Newman, where latchkey ""Super Rich Kids"" can't see past their own one-percent ""Sweet Life"". But once again, Ocean isn't just sniping easy targets; ""why see the world when you got the beach?"" he asks, a Rorschach test of a hook that leaves its levels of bliss or cynicism wholly up to the listener. There are plenty of addicts on the back half of the album: the fiend at the center of ""Crack Rock"" whose family ""stopped inviting you to things"" and ""won't let you hold their infant,"" or the poisoned relationship between a dealer and his mule on ""Lost"". On the record's most harrowing cut, ""Bad Religion"", Ocean is crippled by love and left searching for life's answers in the back of a cab-- the string-bleeding ballad finds the singer offering his most impassioned plea yet: ""This unrequited love/ To me it's nothing but a one man cult and cyanide in my styrofoam cup/ I could never make him love me."" While Channel Orange is stuffed with one-of-a-kind details and characters, its overall scope is grand, as is Ocean's. Tape-hiss interludes bind these very hi-fi songs together with a musty analog quality, and a couple of tracks seem to end mid-sentence, leaving you no choice but to keep going. And there's a timeless philosophy involved here, one of hard-won acceptance and the acknowledgement that love and sex and loss will always draw legends to them. How else to explain ""Pyramids"", a 10-minute time warp that goes from ancient Egyptian wonders to modern strip clubs and essentially reincarnates one of the most storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. But still, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field. ""holding my head. keeping it g [...] whatever 'keeping it g' means to me. i've sorta zoned in on my own definition."" Frank wrote that on December 27, 2011-- the same day he wrote the ""first love"" letter he published last week. Both missives, along with Channel Orange itself, carry the same spirit of confident, open-minded redefinition; he's living in his own world, but also fascinated with what's around him. Currently, his Twitter bio reads: ""i don't know anything. & neither do you."" In Frank Ocean-speak, that's not a statement of ignorance but rather one of wisdom.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/,Def Jam,2012.0
210,Bon Iver,iTunes Session,Rock,6.9,June 22 2012,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"While writing about Pitchfork's No. 1 album of last year, Amanda Petrusich suggested Bon Iver might be the record that frees Justin Vernon from the ""myth of Bon Iver."" It did momentarily distract from the scruffy loner archetype of For Emma, Forever Ago, but the enormous size of the band he assembled to tour it led to new jokes about how alone he wasn't. From the jump, it's clear that the group's just-released iTunes Session isn't meant as a substitute for that live experience. It's an EP, for one thing, and the in-studio format downplays invention. And it begins not with the explosive fanfare of ""Perth"", the song that opens Bon Iver and its attendant live shows but rather the closer, ""Beth/Rest"". It's a curious bit of sequencing until you realize it's actually the song that makes the best case for this particular format. This version puts more emphasis on ""power"" than ""ballad"": Vernon is a distinct singer and what comes across in Session's ""Beth/Rest"" is that he's a strong, gritty one as well. It's an underutilized look for him. The backbeat becomes equally resolute and steady as well, the percussion hitting with purpose rather than wafting like some box kites being knocked about in the wind. It frees the song from being a battleground for opinions about Bruce Hornsby. And it is the highlight. As for the rest of the set, well, this is something like how Bon Iver might have come across with a more traditional approach to production. These aren't exact copies of what appeared on Bon Iver*,* but they're about as close as you can get. Just witness ""Michicant"": those seemingly tossed-off scuffs of reverbed guitars at the beginning are recreated verbatim and yes, someone remembered to bring the bicycle bell.  ""Minnesota, WI"" makes its dropped-octave harmonies stand out a bit more in this setting, but its tricky polyrhythms are otherwise impressively intact. ""Hinnom, TX."" and ""Wash."" sound professional as opposed to magical. But there's value in that, too, as the clarity allows the interlocking layers of keys, brass, and percussion to reveal themselves and prove above all else, Bon Iver was the creation of many very, very sophisticated musicians. But didn't you already know that? There's no continuity here, no rarities outside of a lone cover, and nothing similar to the World Café performance of ""Beth/Rest"", which fundamentally altered the song into a barroom lurker in a way that justified its existence. Though ""Holocene"" appears in typically fine form, Bon Iver's most immediate crowd pleasers-- ""Perth"" and first single ""Calgary""-- are excised in favor of its impressionist deep cuts in a setting that doesn't take advantage of their amorphous structures. The EP ends with a spirited cover of Björk's ""Who Is It?"", where Vernon and the band whip around the tracks's hairpin turns enthusiastically, breathlessly. Coming at the end of six hyper-accurate selections from Bon Iver, whether ""Who Is It?"" does the original justice feels like the wrong question to ask. Justin Vernon is often a very funny, self-deprecating man who makes incredibly serious records, so it's mostly disappointing that iTunes Session doesn't take more chances. Which leads back to the same question that's met every iTunes Session thus far: ""Who exactly is this for?"" If it's looking to capitalize on post-Grammy curiosity, it's a lazy sampler. All of Bon Iver's studio recordings can be considered essential for him as an artist and almost certainly for indie rock as a whole (particularly ""Skinny Love"" and ""Woods""), and there’s not a single track from For Emma, Forever Ago or Blood Bank EP here. It doesn't even make sense for the penny-pinching Bon Iver fan: once again, it's not meant to be confused with Bon Iver: Live! and only a few dollars separates having what is essentially half of Bon Iver and owning the entire thing as it's meant to be heard. I suppose if Bon Iver's not coming to your town any time soon, and you were hella bummed out by his ""SNL"" performance, it might be worth the cost to know he can ""pull it off"" with capable aplomb. Beyond that, it's basically 60% of one of the decade's finest records, so it's more subject to triggering buyer's remorse than critical naysaying. iTunes Session isn't exactly useless-- it turned in decent surveys of bands like Wilco and the Decemberists, whose catalogs are sprawling and erratic.  But this one is mostly a consumer curiosity.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16863-itunes-session/,Jagjaguwar,2012.0
211,Usher,Looking 4 Myself,Pop/R&B,7.6,June 20 2012,Carrie Battan,Contributor,"Usher Raymond's 2010 album Raymond v. Raymond wasn't particularly memorable, but it did provide a platform for an up-and-coming rapper named Nicki Minaj. On the single ""Lil Freak"", cut in the early stages of her tear as an unassailable feature rapper, Minaj delivered one of the more remarkable verses of that year, rapping that she'd take girls ""to go see Usher... like Santa I keep a vixen"" before reeling off the names of all seven reindeer at a cadence that seemed inhuman. On his own song, Usher himself was pushed to the sideline by an artist on the fast track to superstardom. Given the weakness of the record as a whole, you had to wonder if we were witnessing a fading star content to go through the motions. For over a decade, Usher had a remarkable run of slow-burning R&B singles and clattering club hits like 2001's ""U Remind Me"" and ""U Got It Bad"", 2004's ""Confessions Part II"" and Lil Jon crunk-anthem collaboration ""Yeah!"". But on Raymond vs. Raymond, an album recorded on the heels of a divorce, Usher felt uncharacteristically flat and aimless. Fast-forward two years, to the closing track of Usher's new LP, Looking 4 Myself. Here, another upstart New York rapper riffs on Minaj's ""Lil Freak"" verse: ""Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the verse-uh/ If you let me ménage/ I'll take you to see Ursher,"" raps A$AP Rocky. But whereas Minaj was the centerpiece of ""Lil Freak"", Rocky-- along with a whole pack of very of-the-moment collaborators found on Looking 4 Myself-- plays a supporting role to Usher. The singer has clearly found a groove as a reinvigorated leading man, and at 33 years old and seven albums in, Usher's showing just how well he can adapt to a slippery contemporary pop landscape. Along with a cast that includes everyone from Diplo and Noah ""40"" Shebib to Rick Ross and Pharrell, Usher offers up a sharp new collection that serves as a fresh sampler of a smattering of genres, from slick R&B to electronic dance pop to funk. Since it's packed with so many guests and touches on so many styles, Looking 4 Myself invites skepticism. On paper, it looks like an artist throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, but Usher mostly transcends charges of dilettantism. The opening track, ""Can't Stop Won't Stop"", for instance, builds like a throwaway Eurodance arena anthem, but instead of exploding into oblivion after the breakdown it splits into a fizzy and wonky slap of a beat. Part of the success is due to Usher's vocal virtuosity, which in places reaches Michael Jackson-levels of purity. On ballad ""Dive"", he uses shamelessly literal and explicit lyrics that might make you cringe if they'd come from of anyone else: ""It's raining inside your bed/ No parts are dry/ Lovin' made you so wet/ Your Legs/ Your thighs,"" he sings. His vocal mastery allows him to carry a cornball verse like that and transform the song into something more specific, as if he were addressing just one woman instead of delivering a pre-packaged ballad for the ladies. Still, Usher's strength lies in R&B, and he's adjusted well to shifting ground. Since Raymond vs. Raymond, artists like Drake, the Weeknd, and Frank Ocean have developed darker and more atmospheric strains and attracted listeners who previously avoided the genre. Usher excels on a few songs here that cover similar ground, like the dark click-popper ""Lessons for the Lover"" and ""What Happened To U"", a velvety track sung mostly in falsetto helmed by Drake and Weeknd producer Noah ""40"" Shebib. Hearing those songs, it feels like some of the younger artists might have learned a thing or two from Usher when they were formulating their own styles. So while he could have come off as an artist trying to keep up with the kids in that realm, Usher seems instead like an elder statesman with a keen ear for the right collaborators, particularly in choosing Diplo on his surprising lead single ""Climax"". At 18 tracks, not everything on Looking 4 Myself hits the mark, and the album drags on longer than it should. Where the experimentation often succeeds, the editing fails. Usher sounds most uncomfortable and the least sharp on overblown club tracks with long, faceless lists of European producers (see ""Euphoria"" and ""Numb""), and the presence of rote numbers is almost comically predicable. These grabs at low-hanging fruit aside, Usher serves as a good reminder that it's possible to cater to the demands of a discombobulated industry and come out on top.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16727-looking-for-myself/,RCA,2012.0
212,Florence and the Machine,MTV Unplugged,Pop/R&B,5.9,April 12 2012,Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,"To answer your first question: Yes, they still do these. ""MTV Unplugged"" was once a showcase for pop culture writ impossibly large-- a place where the entire world could gasp at Gene Simmons' bare face or where Kurt Cobain could introduce over five million record buyers to the Vaselines. But in recent years, the show's institutional power has fizzled, and its most recent installments have featured tepid, obligatorily low-lit performances from are-they-really-that-famous? acts like 30 Seconds to Mars and Young the Giant. Which is why Florence and the Machine's Unplugged instalment feels so promising. One of the more compelling pop acts to spring up in recent years, it's hard to imagine a voice more equipped to puff new life into the series than that of celestially soulful frontwoman Florence Welch. As on mega-hits like ""Dog Days Are Over"" and ""Shake It Out"", Welch has displayed a talent for sprawling her demons and heartbreak across canvases bigger than the sky: Every song she's ever sung has been writ large. And occasionally, that's the problem. While her promising 2009 debut, Lungs, had the skittish, genre-hopping restlessness of an artist still settling into her sound, the 12 tracks on its followup, Ceremonials, came in only one size: gigantic. Even the ballads beat with earth-shaking percussion were gilded with epic, Greek choral background vocals and all other varieties of sonic baubles. Though Welch's voice is undeniably powerful, the songs beneath it all seemed well-composed and deeply felt, but their emotional impact was often blunted by producer Paul Epworth's unrelenting maximalism, ramped up from his work on Welch's debut. Which makes them perfect candidates for the classic scaled-back, stripped-down approach, right? You'd think so. In quite a few cases, the Unplugged treatment does work wonders. The opening number, ""Only if for a Night"", is more arresting here than it is kicking off Ceremonials, where its haunting power (the song is about being visited in a dream by the ghost of a loved one: typical Florence stuff) was interrupted by a superfluous, glitchy beat. The Unplugged version gives the song much-needed room to breathe, and with fewer distractions the searing imagery of Welch's lyrics have a chance to float to the surface. ""And the grass was so green against my new clothes,"" she trills, losing herself in the song's second verse, ""And I did cartwheels in your honor dancing on tip-toes/ My own secret ceremonials before the service began/ In the graveyard, doing handstands."" It's an oddly joyous funeral rite, but it's Welch articulating the feeling she plumbs best-- deriving light from the deepest darkness and feeling more at home in the world of spirits than the corporeal one. Same goes for ""Breaking Down"". On Ceremonials, that song's edges are padded with stately chamber-pop echoes, as though to protect Welch from bruises as she wrestles her demons to the ground. The sparse arrangement of the Unplugged version allows Welch to find deeper and even more unsettling emotion in the song, transforming the chorus from a pop hook to something like a moaning, seasick dirge. Some of the greatest ""MTV Unplugged"" moments have been somewhat unlikely covers (Maxwell doing Kate Bush! Nirvana doing Lead Belly!), and here we get Welch adding to this enduring trope with her take on ""Try a Little Tenderness"". It's a lovely vocal performance (she hits a note early on that will probably prompt someone to book her for an upcoming Whitney tribute), but it also brings into focus the problem with her Unplugged as a whole: Its emotional range is decidedly limited. Welch's ""Try a Little Tenderness"" is mournful and utterly devoid of playfulness, and-- though no one's going to fault her for her putting her own signature spin on a classic-- so is every other moment of this performance. Which means that ""Tenderness"" bleeds right into the song after it, an acoustic arrangement of the power-ballad ""No Light, No Light"". Her twangy duet with Josh Homme, a cover of the Johnny Cash and June Carter song ""Jackson"", provides a little deviation, but not much. Many of these songs might sound good on their own, but listening to them one after the other exposes their repetitions. There's only a certain number of times you can listen to Welch feeling lost in the verse and then found, transcendently, in the bombast of the chorus before it all starts to feel like a package of ""Amazing Grace""-themed magnetic poetry, with each new track shuffling the elements around just so. Unlike one of Welch's songs, though, Unplugged is a decrescendo, and the performance runs out of steam by the time she gets to two of her best songs, ""Dog Days are Over"" and ""Shake it Out"". The latter, a torch song that has enough oomph not just to move mountains but to pick them up and punt them, peters out into a disappointingly tepid finale. No one who listens to Unplugged will accuse Welch of being an untalented singer, but they might be left wanting more from the material she lends her voice to. Fans will enjoy hearing Welch's songs opened up in this format, but her Unplugged definitely doesn't rank among the classics of the series. The artists who have been responsible for the best and most enduring Unplugged albums-- Nirvana, Lauryn Hill, and Jay-Z's collaboration with the Roots-- all used the candle-lit stage to explore new directions in their respective sounds. For Welch, it serves the opposite end: It displays the boundlessness of her vocal talent but finds her tethered to a frustratingly limited aesthetic.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16480-florence-the-machine-mtv-unplugged/,Island,2012.0
213,Alabama Shakes,Boys & Girls,Rock,7.8,April 9 2012,Rachael Maddux,Contributor,"Alabama Shakes' lead singer, guitarist and primary songwriter Brittany Howard began cobbling her band together in high school mostly just for the sake of having a band. It certainly wasn't with the notion of breaking into her hometown's music scene-- in Athens, Ala., there's not much of one to break into. So she and her friends Steve Johnson, Zac Cockrell, and Heath Fogg made do playing cover-band gigs in dive bars, occasionally slipping their raggedy garage-soul originals in among the Led Zeppelin and AC/DC, and eventually making enough to warrant some studio time up in Nashville early last year. Those sessions produced the 11 tracks of Alabama Shakes' debut LP, Boys & Girls, which they shopped around for a while and finally released on ATO (Rough Trade in the UK) this week. Things are now moving fast: The band has hit the late-night TV circuit, they followed Fiona Apple's headlining slot at NPR's big SXSW showcase last month, their upcoming shows are almost entirely sold-out, and they've been booked as openers for Jack White's spring solo tour. Of course, because Alabama Shakes boast these fairly aw-shucks origins, lyrics that seem deeply felt, multiple sonic reference points predating 1975, an affinity for analog, and more than one guitar, by default they've been thrown like chum into the shark tank that is ""real music,"" where fans and critics with false memories of rock's pure and noble past-- and others with aversions to earnest craft both feigned and actual-- gnash out their differences. But engaging with these paranoid extremes bypasses the whole middle swath of the matter-- the weird, beautiful part, where all the blood and guts are. Here's what seems real enough to me: Boys & Girls is a solid debut, really good but not earth-shifting, a record clearly (blessedly) recorded before anyone much cared who they were or weren't, possibly even before they were entirely sure themselves. The album is largely confessional-- not in the singer/songwritery sense, but in that it's riddled with admissions that probably wouldn't have been made by any other means, words that feel lighter sung than spoken. Album opener and lead single ""Hold On"", its central guitar riff ribboning and pooling like slow-poured honey, is the first of many tracks where it's not entirely clear if Howard is singing to, about, or as herself, God, or some boy as she rips through the chorus: ""Yeah, you got to wait/ But I don't want to wait!"" ""I feel so homesick/ Where is my home?"" Howard wonders on ""Rise to the Sun"" before the song dips into a coda of timorous guitar and crashing drums. On the shadowy, fingersnapped ""Goin' to the Party"" she sings about running around town, getting wasted, and taking care of some drunk boy; when she woozily coos, ""gotta take me back now, I'm still somebody's daughter,"" she sounds half-annoyed and half-comforted in that very particular way that comes from being young and restless and knowing there's someone waiting up for you, but at least there's someone waiting up for you. Howard's pain feels raw, but like it won't always be-- as if once these first scrapes heal, her skin will be good and tough, but right now they smart like hell. ""Heartbreaker"" is staggering, gut-punched, a shiny organ weeping and straining away as she laments, ""Oh, I wanted to grow old with you/ You told me so, but then you go/ How was I supposed to know?"" But later on the slow-boiling ""Be Mine"" she's regained her footing-- she's direct, nearly petulant: ""If they wanna fight/ They done started fucking with the wrong heart."" Three minutes in the song shifts focus to a single demand, Howard crowing and screaming, ""Be my baby, be my baby!"" over and over as the band spins out, crashing and bumping, then circles back home as she loosens into a string of cries and hoots. Live, Howard often plants her feet flat onstage before bellowing out a line, as if bracing herself against the force of what's to come, and it's easy to imagine her doing that in the studio, too. Most of the time there's a payoff, but sometimes the build-up dwarfs the delivery, her voice coming out thinner and tighter than you'd expect; maybe she needs a vocal coach, or just a little more time to work out exactly how those pipes of hers like best to blow. For now, though, flashes of more contemporary analogs (Macy Gray, Amy Winehouse) swirled in among the more obvious classic-soul vocal touchstones keep her Janis Joplin tendencies from curdling into ""Jackie Jormp-Jomp"". Boys & Girls was recorded live in the studio, but the power of the band's stage show hasn't fully carried over-- at times their delivery also seems thin and tight. Perhaps it's a matter of timing, the number and profile and intensity of the gigs the band has played in recent months solidifying their groove to a degree that outstrips what they were capable of throwing down on tape this time last year. Or maybe it's the production-- a little muddled, and not always in the cozy, old-school way they may have been going for. So many bands get churned out of the hype machine seeming either too fully formed or too ephemeral to get attached to, but Alabama Shakes have sparked, in me at least, a degree of ownership, and one that urges, ""work with Jack White."" Maybe sometime this summer, after the tour, he could work his analog-only magic and coax some big, crunching, whalloping mess out of them--something to ensure they get to stick around for a while, and on their own terms: weird, sweaty, desirous.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16479-boys-and-girls/,ATO,2012.0
214,Dr. John,Locked Down,Folk/Country,7.5,April 3 2012,Stephen M. Deusner,,"The Bonnaroo Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, took its name from Dr. John's 1974 album Desitively Bonnaroo-- New Orleans patois for ""good time"" or ""party."" So it makes sense that he's become a mainstay of the event, culminating in a fierce performance in 2011 with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. That onstage collaboration extended into the studio, as the younger performer produced the elder's latest album, Locked Down. You're right to be skeptical: A certain amount of success gives an artist the leeway to work with his heroes, and for every Van Lear Rose, there's Justin Vernon shouting out Bruce Hornsby. Auerbach has already done production work for Jessica Lea Mayfield, the Ettes, and Hacienda, but Locked Down is his first intergenerational record. It's an unlikely collaboration, primarily because the man born Mac Rebennack seemed destined for a respectful revival focusing on his New Orleans roots and the melting pot of styles and sounds represented by the Third Ward. Think Joe Henry, some Americana fans, and a Grammy nomination. On the other hand, it's not like Locked Down represents a comeback for Dr. John: If not exactly prolific, he's been consistent throughout the last decade, releasing at least one album every two years and entertaining new twists on his time-tested Big Easy rock. Even so, this album still stands out among his recent work, not so much for the leap of faith he took collaborating with Auerbach but because it turned out so damn well. Producing and playing like there's no such thing as boomer nostalgia, the Black Key not only respects Dr. John's southern-fried eccentricities but amplifies them. Locked Down is a weird-ass gumbo of grotty funk and R&B, littered with raunchy reeds, leering organ riffs, and blustery guitar. Often it sounds busy and overcooked, but that's better than chaste reverence on any day. The idea isn't to evoke Bourbon Street or some staid idea of New Orleans history. Instead, these songs trace dead ends and back alleys, wandering past houses still bearing high-water marks, finally arriving at a party no tourist was invited to. While it's never explicitly invoked on Locked Down, Katrina haunts these songs and fires Dr. John's outrage over class inequities and flawed American systems, whether social or judicial. The songs are enlivened by that anger, and if he occasionally sounds like he's shooing the kids off his lawn-- ""kids with Uzis, icing suckers,"" he laments on ""Ice Age""-- at least he's still got some fire in him. Even at 71, his voice has lost little of its distinctive rubberiness, which makes him sound like a more agile Tom Waits, only with a thick Creole accent on ""Eleggua"" and ""Kingdom of Izzness"". Not one of these songs proceeds in any expected, predictable way. ""You Lie"" and ""My Children, My Angels"" may be the most immediately catchy, but every track boasts a prominent hook, whether it's Auerbach's extended guitar outro on ""Getaway"" or the second line Shaft funk of ""Eleggua"". Much like his local forebears from Fats Domino to Professor Longhair, Dr. John has never met a style that he couldn't integrate into his music, so the Afro-pop guitars on ""Ice Age"" and the rumbling syncopations of ""Revolution"" don't sound out of place from him. On the other hand, they're a surprise coming from Auerbach, whose vocabulary once began and ended with lo-fi blues rock. So perhaps Locked Down represents a bigger leap for him than for Dr. John, who presides over the album with his usual authority. But both men understand that none of these sounds or ideas is of any use if it doesn't move.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16455-locked-down/,Nonesuch,2012.0
215,Mobb Deep,Black Cocaine EP,Rap,5.4,January 11 2012,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Does it devalue Mobb Deep's output from the 1990s if I think they could still possibly perform at that level despite over a decade's worth of evidence to the contrary? Let me clarify: I'm not talking so much about The Infamous or Hell on Earth, those would require reopening a window of commercial relevance for that rugged and raw aesthetic as well as Prodigy and Havoc reemerging as the fatalistic old souls of their early 20s, preferably rocking Hennessy football jerseys. That's probably not going to happen, and it's not entirely their fault. But they don't need any of that to aspire to the standards set by the still-awesome Murda Muzik, their 1999 LP which, in retrospect, could be seen as a forerunner to DipSet's synthesis of deadpan, absurdist violence, and a general disregard for actual rhyming. They just need to be entertaining and not give a fuck, and I mean-- have you seen Prodigy's Twitter feed since he got out of jail? But while @PRODIGYMOBBDEEP is more than capable of reminding us never to question his trendsetting nor what he brought to the table, very little of that batshit sense of purpose or fun makes it to Black Cocaine. The trouble isn't that Havoc and Prodigy have run out of things to say, or that they don't really have much to rap about anymore-- they're real, you're shook, and Prodigy will almost certainly have sex with your woman if only to make your bitch ass realize your own capability for being shook. That shit obviously never goes out of style, but rather than the likely legitimate insanity Prodigy flexed on 2007's Return of the Mac, the two wring inspiration from that mode with the stubbornness of trying to get that last bit of toothpaste out the tube. Once the author of the illest first lines (""Quiet Storm"", ""Shook Ones, Pt. II"", the list goes on), Prodigy hardly comes up with one memorable rhyme during the entirety of Black Cocaine-- we get brief teases at Illuminati P conspiracy theorizing, but little anyone who's seen a one dollar bill couldn't come up with. Likewise, Havoc delivers bar after bar of near-mesmeric placeholders, but he does boast about having ""a ledger on my MacBook,"" so now you know Excel is the spreadsheet of choice for dunn accountants. Still, at least they're not fronting like club attendees or sex symbols anymore, and any remnant of G-Unit factory production is swapped out for wheelhouse Mobb with plenty of synthesized horns and ice-grilled hi-hats. But the title track and ""Conquer"" just remind me of any number of Infamy deep cuts whose titles escape me and whose quality doesn't inspire me to find out. If nothing else, you can be happy that Alchemist is inevitably involved, and I seriously doubt anyone's still holding ""Takeover"" against them if Nas isn't. While it's a distinct pleasure to hear Queensbridge's finest reconcile their differences, it's a distinct disappointment all the same at the utter lack of spark present on ""Get It Forever"": Nastradamus is considered one of the least-inspired hip-hop records ever made, and even then, these guys could still come up with something as bracing and utterly badass as ""Family"". And you can also admire the stylistic window dressing as Hav and P try some kind of weird upper register flow on ""Dead Man Shoes"". But they never find their footing, while you can imagine Bounty Killa spending the pauses during his offbeat hook wondering whether Gwen Stefani still has his phone number. And so Black Cocaine comes across as not particularly different than, say, recent records from Saigon or Uncle Murda or M.O.P., guys who should be able to use the cratered rap economy to their advantage and create the rawest, most uncompromising, and NY-centric hardcore hip-hop they so choose, but who ultimately sound confused as to how to navigate a land with no boundaries. (Just bearing witness to ""Hell On Earth 2k11"" featuring French Montana and Waka Flocka Flame is kinda mindblowing either way.) Truth is, Mobb Deep sound kinda unsure as to where they stand, too proud to truly change up their style and still too much of a name brand to have to.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16117-black-cocaine-ep/,Infamous,2011.0
216,Nirvana,Live at the Paramount,Rock,8.8,January 11 2012,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"One month after Nirvana released Nevermind, they performed a gig at Seattle's Paramount Theatre on Halloween. A week after the show, Nevermind would crack the Top 40. A month later, it would be certified Gold. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was climbing to alarming heights on the Billboard chart. There was an imposing phalanx of video cameras present at the venue, to capture the gig in its entirety. The band was, understandably, a little freaked. There is plenty of live Nirvana already available to us: the half-hearted-feeling rush job that was From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah in 1996; the commercial release, last year, of the beloved bootleg Live at Reading; the Unplugged record. But the joy of Live at the Paramount is hearing the charge of this moment: a great band newly famous, still reeling and flooded with nervy adrenaline. Every single song on this setlist has already been featured once, or more, on some other Nirvana live record. But it's still invaluable. Kurt's voice sounds remarkably powerful here: He sang in a way that was obviously unsustainable, even with the aid of heavy cough syrup, and there's a thrill, although a slightly selfish one, of hearing his voice rip the air before he had begun to scream it down to the threads. His peculiar, yowling phrasing may have been a deliberate choice, or it might have been the only way he managed to wrangle those notes from a constricted voice box, but there is a terrible, riveting intensity to it: Words feel torn from him, bearing fishhooks on their way out. ""Aneurysm""'s ""Love you so much/ It makes me sick"" becomes ""Laahve yeww sowl much et makes me SECK."" It physically hurts to hear, as it always has, but it gives you some of the most committed, clear performances of Nirvana's canonical songs as you're likely to get. There is some time-capsule fun to have listening to Paramount-- one of the biggest cheers is for ""School""! Krist Novoselic makes a wince-inducing ""Smile, you're on 'Candid Camera'"" joke! But the album's queerest, and most fascinating, punk-rock sociological moment comes from the protracted lead-up to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", which was already the elephant in the room. You can practically see the feet-dragging and hand-twisting that leads up to it, like antsy kids being herded into Sunday service. First, Novoselic makes some noncommittal crack about the absence of Halloween constumes in the crowd (""unless you're all supposed to be punk rockers."") Then they play ""Floyd the Barber"", one of the least melodic and sludgiest songs in the catalog. Afterward, a time-killing little tongue-in-cheek instrumental jam. Then, Novoselic's voice cuts back into the mic, as he hollers, curiously, ""White boy funk sucks!"" Only after all this fidgeting is finished do those chords fire up. In the moment you can hear roaring to life the enormous machine that would, less than a year later, take Nevermind to multi-platinum status. The version is anything but noncommittal-- Cobain leans into every ""a denial"" harder than the last. It's exhilarating and poignant. You can hear they still unambiguously love this song, even if it was starting to make things complicated for them.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16162-nirvana-live-at-the-paramount/,Geffen,2011.0
217,Amy Winehouse,Lioness: Hidden Treasures,Pop/R&B,6.3,December 9 2011,Andrew Ryce,Contributor,"Lioness is not Amy Winehouse's long-lost gem or interrupted follow-up album, nor is it a revealing view of a tortured star in the fraught final stages of her life. Instead, in true record-industry fashion, Lioness is a collection of odds-and-sods cobbled together over the course of nine years of recordings to create something that kinda-sorta feels like an album. Executive produced by longtime partner Salaam Remi, who helmed her 2003 debut album, Frank, Lioness carries little of the subversive swagger or playful arrogance of the Mark Ronson-dominated Back to Black. Whether it's merely all the material that was left, or an effort to salvage her image after years of tabloid drama and self-abuse, Lioness presents a picture of a talented singer at her most restrained and polite. And let's be honest: Polite is the last thing we expect (or want) from Amy Winehouse. That's not to say the results aren't satisfying: No matter what she's singing, it remains thrilling to hear that voice come to life again. On Lioness, for better or for worse, she takes on the role of standards singer: It feels like a hearkening back to her jazzy Frank days, the result of having Remi at the head of the project rather than Ronson. When it works, it really works: Opener ""Our Day Will Come"" is a gorgeous blend of triumph and autumnal wistfulness, a savvy intro to a record that's bound to evoke emotions just as nuanced and conflicted in its listeners. However, on tracks like ""The Girl From Ipanema"" or first single and Tony Bennett duet ""Body and Soul"", she sounds like a lounge singer, that unmistakable wit and smarmy charm only a faint glint in otherwise serviceable performances. Considering that Mark Ronson-- producer of her signature tracks like ""Rehab""-- is probably more responsible for her fame than anyone else, it's surprising to see his involvement reduced to such a minuscule level. As ever, his contributions are the highlight: A new version of the Zutons' ""Valerie"" turns what was a tongue-in-cheek cover into one of her most infectious vocal performances. Meanwhile, his melodramatic rendering of Carole King's ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" toes the line between elegant and overblown, but better yet it's a shroud of pomp surrounding one of Winehouse's most delicately powerful vocals. When she breaks out into her best falsetto on the track's bridge, it's one of the few moments on Lioness that feels truly, heartbreakingly poignant, enough to cut through its stodgy accompaniment. Winehouse's best material never came from covers or standards, however, but her personality: her bitter sarcasm, her flagrant profanity, and her dominant-but-demure air of not-giving-a-fuck. Even though half of Lioness is by her own pen, it's a different view of Winehouse's songwriting persona: The gorgeous ballad ""Half Time"" is endearing but lacks the sardonic bite of her other slower material like ""Wake Up Alone"" (which itself is included in an alternate Remi-produced version here), and it's easy to imagine the fake-cutesy ""Best Friends, Right?"" being more effective given an arrangement that wasn't so transparently cutesy. Back to Black highlight ""Tears Dry on Their Own"" is present in its ""original version,"" an almost unrecognizably elegiac arrangement that on the other hand not only emphasizes the strength of Winehouse's own songwriting but its diversity as well. Chalk it up to fine-tuned and image-conscious execution, but there's little on Lioness: Hidden Treasures that sounds throwaway, or like it should have never been released; but there's equally little that sounds absolutely essential. Released before the album, the Nas collaboration ""Like Smoke"" seems like an attempt at a new Winehouse jam, a pertinent reminder of her slightly more adult-contemporary-challenging ""urban"" side, the part of her that made her more than just a Grammy-adorned, technically proficient singer. Here the track sounds like a guide vocal, unsure and smothered in reverb, with Nas filling in an excess of white space rather than just guesting. On the otherwise funny, doo-wop-styled ""Between the Cheats"", her detached drawl enters full-on mumble territory, Winehouse sounding like she either can't remember or can't enunciate the words. The chorus of backing vocals feels mocking as a result, but it's a necessary moment of discomfort on a record that sometimes feels like it's desperately trying to sanitize a wild spirit after years of chaos. If that all sounds a little negative, it's because Lioness is still weighed down with the baggage that goes along with any posthumous compilation-- but as these things go, it's a pretty strong disc. It flows well, and if Winehouse didn't sound so oddly neutered on so much of it, Lioness could easily be another solid entry in her catalog. As it stands, though, it sounds like the anachronistic time-travel job it is, going backward through the career of an artist who had a very distinct developmental arc. At least in one regard, Island and Salaam Remi have done the ""honorable"" thing: There's no pretense of artistic intention here, and no exploitative stabs at an artist in the most vulnerable moments of her short life. But in their mission to present Winehouse as a singer first and foremost, whiting out her personal problems and demons-- the very things that made Back to Black such a transcendent album in the first place-- they reduce her to her pre-Black standard of budding talent. Instead of adding anything concrete to her legacy, Lioness only reaffirms what we already knew about her, and hopefully why she deserves to be remembered as an artist rather than a media circus.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16112-lioness-hidden-treasures/,Island,2011.0
218,Mac Miller,Blue Slide Park,Rap,1.0,December 8 2011,Jordan Sargent,Contributor,"At the 2000 VMAs, Eminem's performance of ""The Real Slim Shady"" featured him walking across Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and into Radio City Music Hall followed by a few hundred extras that had been styled in his image, bleached hair and all. The performance was an arresting, and very literal, visual representation of the song's claim of there being ""a million of us just like me."" Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller is having his ""'The Real Slim Shady' at the VMAS"" moment right now, even if he'll never actually perform there. There are hundreds of thousands of listeners trailing him intensely-- Blue Slide Park sold just about 145,000 copes in its first week in stores, making it the first independently distributed debut album to go No. 1 in 16 years. And the reason Miller's mass of fans follow him is not because of his music, at least not completely. It's because he looks just like them, because they can see themselves up on the stage behind him, if not next to him. It's a presumptive conclusion, but it's hard to find much, if anything, in Miller's music that suggests otherwise. He is an outsider, but he brings no outsider's perspective to his music. Forget Eminem, Miller's point of view is less unique than Asher Roth's or Childish Gambino's. He lusts after fame, money, and women, and he smokes weed and parties. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with that; it is rap music, of course. But it does raise the question of why Miller is so popular, because despite his claim of being a cross between John Lennon and UGK, he's mostly just a crushingly bland, more intolerable version of Wiz Khalifa without the chops, desire, or pocketbook for enjoyable singles. Unless you buy into Miller's persona-- and why would you?-- Blue Slide Park offers you nothing that you can't find done more much artfully by, say, Curren$y. This is, in a way, rap music's fault. Mac Miller has been called ""frat rap,"" and while there's a slight truth to that, the term leaves unacknowledged the fact that frat guys used to engage with the rap world writ large. That interaction may have involved an unhealthy appreciation for Jurassic 5, but it also involved rocking YoungbloodZ and Ying Yang Twins songs at parties. The pop world has left rap behind, save four or five rappers, and it's opened a door for someone like Mac Miller to seize the college-aged, white-male fanbase. If that fanbase is interacting less with rap music, then maybe they've rallied around Miller because he also barely engages with the wider rap world. Consider the fact that Blue Slide Park has not one feature-- not a guest verse or chorus. For a contemporary rap album, let alone a No. 1 rap album, that is basically unheard-of. Before you consider that to be a noble pursuit, the album could've used somebody, anybody, to break up the monotony of Miller on the mic. Miller's world is a hermetic one, and unless it's one you inhabit, the album holds no appeal. It's a normal rap album, sure, but as listeners we should strive for more than a no-stakes work by a guy wearing the same streetwear brands and snapbacks as everyone else, who has merely found a niche and exploited it. Miller's hustle can't be knocked, and it shouldn't be, but his art is 144,487 times less remarkable than his first week sales numbers would have you believe. His success is not a mirage, no. But it is a projection.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16113-blue-side-park/,Rostrum,2011.0
219,The Roots,Undun,Rap,7.3,December 6 2011,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Undun is the story of a man, Redford Stevens, dying in reverse, rewinding from the moment he became a statistic and hitting the points in his life where he's at his most self-aware. That he's a criminal who got caught up in the familiar street-hustle trappings that the modern media's documented countless times is a pivotal detail-- it's hit at an angle that seems to emphasize the futile inevitability of it all. His life could be any number of misdirected narratives that ends with a toe tag, and what details listeners learn about him are hazy, buried under archetypal turns of fate and decisive struggles. That this protagonist is a fictionalized composite of a handful of real people, filtered through a matter-of-fact narrative that splits character ambivalence with journalistic impartiality, only makes his lack of direction and the failure of any real closure stand out even more. ""Lotta niggas go to prison,"" Dice Raw states on ""Tip the Scale"", ""how many come out Malcolm X?"" So the Roots' latest album isn't a sprawling, rise-and-fall crime story, not a condemnation or a veneration of a man living outside the law, not a bullet-riddled grand guignol heavy on explicit details of soldiers getting cut down. It's a character study of a man whose existential crisis ends only with his death-- a death gone largely unspecified, the glamor and tragedy washed over with a doomed resignation. That's a hard thing to pull off, even for a band as given to deep-thinking concepts as the Roots are. And when your main lyrical catalyst is Black Thought-- a man more given to allusions than direct statements-- it's likely that it'll take a while for the full scope of Undun to really sink in. If and when it does, it might strike listeners as a bit skeletal: omit the mood-setting instrumental bookends, including a brief, four-part orchestral suite that builds off Sufjan Stevens' ""Redford (For Yia-Yia and Pappou)"", and you've got maybe a half hour's worth of material. By ?uestlove's accounts, writing Redford's story introduced the headaches and challenges that come with scriptwriting into their songwriting, and what's left on Undun is the end result of frequent revisions and rewrites that attempt to reconcile character, theme, and continuity. If it comes at the expense of nuance, it's not always obvious: There's an easy-to-trace narrative line from Redford's acceptance of his fate (""Sleep"") to his acknowledgement of how close it's approaching (""Make My""), back through declarations of aggravated toughness (""One Time""), and celebratory fatalism (""Kool On""), along ups and downs that juxtapose motivation (""Stomp"") and helplessness (""Lighthouse""). When the vocal portion of the album ends with two of the bleakest sets of verses in the Roots discography, peaking with the estrangement of ""I Remember"" and the desperation of ""Tip the Scale"", Undun reveals itself as a story where a man's actual death isn't quite as tragic as the circumstances that pushed him to it. The catch is that the inevitable familiarity of this storyline, even in the service of a deep emotional study, is almost an end in itself-- a cycle seen far too often, played out in terms anyone who's ever been or known someone with their back against the wall can understand. And if Undun succeeds at putting one man's criminal-world struggle with free will and fate in empathetic terms, it does so at the expense of any unique details or unusual traits that would set him apart-- Redford is humanized, but he's not entirely individualized. If you've bought an Apple device in the last couple of years, you can download a free app that includes some world-building video clips and photos that give him more of a full-life context. If you're still relying on a Blackberry and a clickwheel iPod, you're left with the voices of Black Thought, Dice Raw, and the now-more-googleable Greg Porn to fill in most of the blanks. They're admirable technicians and can be charismatic on their own terms, but voicing raw emotion isn't a major strength for any of them. What you do get is a heightened sense of perplexed frustration, and there are times when Black Thought actually hits another level in his lyrics to meet it. A resilient, on-the-grind turn of phrase like ""I'm never sleeping like I'm on methamphtamines/ Move like my enemy 10 steps ahead of me"" (""Kool On"") is delivered with the same emphasis as a bitter, regretful line like ""I'll leave the memories here, I won't need them/ If I stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom"" (""Lighthouse""). But if that's one of the reasons Undun feels almost relentless in its singleminded dejection, it's also proof that, if Black Thought can't always push through a sentiment with his voice, he can at least deliver the fuck out of an idea. The other MCs in the Roots' core provide some welcome shifts in tone: Greg Porn's nasal drone often slips into bluntly nihilistic imagery (""Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat/ Daddy should've let me be a stain on the bed sheets""), and Dice Raw's rapper/singer double-threat role continues to provide a heart of much-needed pathos. His closing line on ""One Time"" might be the most pitch-perfect moment of film noir cynicism on the album: ""To make it to the bottom, such a high climb."" When Phonte and Big K.R.I.T. deliver guest verses that still feel like relative afterthoughts, it's a bit disappointing, but they come strong enough to keep the album's fated, introspective mood consistent. There's one other aspect to Undun that gives it a sense of ambivalence, even if it's a minor and comparative one: The music itself feels less immediate. After How I Got Over channeled frustrated, brooding soul toward a gradual expansion into triumphant liveliness, the limited palette of down-to-mid-tempo dirges here feels almost stiflingly gloomy. Which means it works-- if this album is a cinematic experience, the score here fills in the cues for moods that the MCs mostly just suggest. The drums-and-keys structure feels more delicate and less urgent than the Roots' best meditative moments, and what few tracks there are with some kick to them-- the burbly guitar-driven ""Kool On"", the worried funk of ""Lighthouse""-- have more of a pull in their chorus than anything in the instrumentation does. Yet the cumulative effect of all that mournful weight is effective enough in the story's service. And in the run-up to ""Tip the Scale"", a string-accented elegy loosely reminiscent of ""You Got Me"", the idea comes across that any glimmer of optimism in this album would be beside the point. This isn't the Roots' most accessible album, and it's definitely their most downbeat, but it comes from a place that isn't always easy to dwell.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16102-the-roots-undun/,Def Jam,2011.0
220,Childish Gambino,Camp,Rap,1.6,December 2 2011,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"If you buy only one hip-hop album this year, I'm guessing it'll be Camp. The album maintains some of the overweening humor of Donald Glover's sitcom ""Community"", but Glover's exaggerated, cartoonish flow and overblown pop-rap production are enough to make Camp one of the most uniquely unlikable rap records of this year (and most others). What's worse is how he uses heavy topics like race, masculinity, relationships, street cred, and ""real hip-hop"" as props to construct a false outsider persona. On record, he paints himself as a misunderstood victim of cultural preconceptions who is obviously smarter and funnier than his primetime material suggests. Unfortunately, it's a position that holds up to absolutely no scrutiny whatsoever. Glover's not doing himself any favors with a rap handle taken from the Wu-Tang Name Generator, but that'd be easy to overlook if Camp functioned as anything more than a series of similar one-note gags. On a song-by-song basis, he scripts a slightly off-brand, fictional version of Kanye West being played for laughs. We could talk about Glover's bloodlines all day, but Childish Gambino's paternity test traces straight back to ""All Falls Down"". ""You See Me"" reimagines ""Niggas in Paris"" as a meme cemetery, with Glover painfully leaning into herniated punchlines like, ""She's an overachiever/ All she does is suck seed."" (Or maybe ""Asian girls everywhere... UCLA!"" will eventually end up on a T-shirt.) The bottle-service electro of ""Heartbeat"" could have been the 10th-funniest song on 808s & Heartbreak-- somewhere between ""The Coldest Winter"" and ""Love Lockdown""-- and it's actually trying for laughs. A few of Camp's tracks focus on more inspirational topics than ""making up for the fucks I missed in high school,"" but they usually emulate ""Jesus Walks"", or when trying to be slightly more humble,""Get By"". And any shred of relatability Glover establishes by reminiscing about sinkbaths with his cousin, or trying to fit into the white school his parents busted their asses to send him to, are cancelled out by R&B hooks so garish and impersonal they make Lupe Fiasco's Lasers sound dignified. Supporters may rush to praise Glover as a ""multi-talent"" due to Camp's self-production, but his cratedigging begins with The College Dropout and ends with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, all of it Blingee'd up with assistance from ""Community"" composer Ludwig Goransson. Yes, that's a lot of Yeezy talk, but the most insidious aspect of Camp is how Glover operates from a *pre-*Kanye inferiority complex where he senses that any dismissal of his music stems from gangsta rap still being the predominant aesthetic version of hip-hop (never mind that the most commercially relevant guy who can be feasibly be called ""gangsta rap"" right now is Rick Ross, and even he's widely beloved on account of being an acknowledged pathological liar). This much is obvious from the tone-deaf ""All of the Shine,"" and especially ""Backpackers"", a preemptive strike at his always-male, usually educated haters. Note how its title co-opts the one epithet more outdated than ""hipster"" in rap music circa 2011. Glover isn't strictly a comedy rapper, but he flows like a comic actor: When he's trying to be playful, his voice hitches in a pubescent squeak, and when he ""goes in,"" he's still delivering one room-clearing punchline after another with the earnestness of the most confused Rhymesayers guy ever. At the very least, Camp can serve as hashtag rap's tombstone, and I'll just present some choice quotes without comment so you can decide for yourself: ""I made the beat and murdered it, Casey Anthony,"" ""You can kiss my ass, Human Centipede,"" ""I got a girl on my arm, dude show respect/ Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech."" Every attempt Glover makes to present himself as an inside operative confounding stereotypes about mainstream rap rings totally false. In ""Fire Fly"", he brags about the ease of scoring college gigs and college girls (while rhyming ""LSU"" with ""molest you"") and then complains: ""No live shows because I can't find sponsors/ For the only black guy at a Sufjan concert."" Bullshit. OK, look: I realize that there's a chance some kid will hear that line and feel validated, and you know, the last thing we need is an armchair cracker like myself relating contrary anecdotal evidence about the demographics at Sufjan Stevens' last concert. So let's just look at the facts: Jay-Z and Beyoncé could be seen at Grizzly Bear shows in 2009, Justin Vernon has a free pass to jump on any track he chooses, and producers spent the year sampling Beach House, the xx, and Tame Impala. How does Glover explain Drake? Is he ""crazy or hood,"" or just a half-Jewish, former child actor from Toronto who's already sold 600,000 copies of Take Care while signed to Lil Wayne's record label? I mean, sub-major hip-hop isn't a post-cred, post-racial utopia by any means, but I can't think of another time when there were more options for listeners of just about any race or background seeking to identify with rappers on a non-allegorical level. I just have to assume Glover has completely ignored the success of Lil B, Main Attrakionz, Curren$y, Kendrick Lamar, Odd Future, Danny Brown, and especially Das Racist when he meekly moans, ""Is there room in the game for a lame that rhymes/ And wears short shorts and tells jokes sometimes?"" It's the perfect summation of Camp: preposterously self-obsessed, but not the least bit self-aware. Tell me that ain't insecure.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16074-camp/,Glassnote,2011.0
221,The Black Keys,El Camino,Rock,7.4,December 2 2011,Rob Harvilla,Contributor,"It behooves us to take 90 seconds here and figure out how this band got so popular and enduring. The Black Keys were born in the teeth of the early-aughts ""Rock Is Back!"" movement, wherein a cadre of uncouth garage-y bands all named The ______s saved us from the terrorists and/or the Backstreet Boys. Eventual result: deserved ignominy (the Vines), undeserved ignominy (the Hives), bewildered near-implosion (the Strokes), and bewildering total implosion (the White Stripes). The years have not been kind. You didn't figure the Keys as sole survivors and mainstream lifers when The Big Come Up emerged in 2002 and offered a walking rockist orgasm: two gawky white dudes from Akron, Ohio, drums and surly guitar and burning-oatmeal-mouthed yawps of not terribly articulate romantic frustration, all powering cartoonishly virile garage-blues jams of prison-phone-call fidelity and sentiment. Ridiculous and kind of awesome. (This assumes racially uneasy cultural appropriation is no longer an issue for you, but if so, feel free to evoke the Blueshammer scene in the Ghost World movie and the hell with it.) And so. They named their second album Thickfreakness; they recorded their third album in an abandoned tire factory and named it Rubber Factory. For a while there, they always did confoundingly well in critics' polls, as though they were every single rock scribe's seventh-favorite band. They evolved incredibly slowly-- you can enjoy their early work tremendously and never retain five consecutive seconds of it beyond their cover of ""Have Love Will Travel"". Danger Mouse got involved as a producer, to the immediately evident benefit of no one. Coupla daffy side projects in there somewhere. (BlakRoc!) Ah yes, and they got their music in a shitload of ads, from Victoria's Secret to Zales to American Express to Subaru, like just so much capitalism, to the extent that they went on The Colbert Report with Vampire Weekend and clowned themselves about it. By which time they'd broken through. Last year's Brothers, their sixth album, had wit and pop charm and a minor hit in ""Tighten Up"" (and unremitting bloat, but ah), and thus came the Spin cover, the Saturday Night Live appearances, the Grammys. And now we greet El Camino, their best and (not coincidentally) goofiest album, a veritable frat-worthy ""Pimp 'n' Ho"" party in which T. Rex has somehow been tricked into serving as house band. The riffs are glam-nasty, the lyrics sublimely knuckleheaded, the basslines nimble and bombastic, the mood frivolous and fun and unabashedly corny. It's way shorter than Brothers, too. Sweet cars, witchy women, ""Gold on the Ceiling."" A bizarre attempt to philosophically combine the videos for ""Sabotage"" and ""Legs"". The fine line between a tricked-out GTO and ""GTFO."" Danger Mouse figured it out, for one thing. He unnecessarily arted up 2008's Attack & Release (plus the hit off Brothers), and his angelic-choir/space-glockenspiel Super Mario Galaxy fantasias still distract-- everything's a goddamn spaghetti western with this guy. But Camino's sonic frills are mercifully few, content to stick your head right in Patrick Carney's bass drum as he stomps through the caveman jam ""Hell of a Season"" with virtuosic anti-virtuosity, or revel in the machine-gun surge of Dan Auerbach's gong-banging guitar on surging opener ""Lonely Boy"". It's a shame Rock Band is no longer a thing. ""Gold on the Ceiling"" is just filthy, like George Thorogood scoring porn, all raunchy organ and licentious handclaps and chorus help from ladies attempting to sound like the sorts of ladies Steely Dan loved to write songs about. ""I wanna buy some time/ But don't have a dime,"" goes the raucous one called ""Money Maker"". Better cash some Subaru checks. The lyrics! The lyrics are hilarious. Great advice, via Brothers: ""Well, you can watch her strut/ But keep your mouth shut."" God bless Auerbach for ignoring it, and, amid the keening/crunching stomp of ""Run Right Back"", dropping some serious knowledge: ""Well she's a special thing/ She doesn't read too much, oh/ But there's no doubt/ She's written about."" Which is really just a prelude to the miraculous five-word sequence that is ""Finest exterior/ She's so superior,"" which, Jesus. Show me the CARFAX, Romeo. Your emotional climax is ""Little Black Submarines"", which starts acoustic and pathos-ridden: ""A broken heart is blind,"" goes the biologically suspect refrain. But then, hosanna, the distortion kicks in, the riff from ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"" is lifted wholesale, and suddenly we are rocking, Carney and Auerbach in call-and-response/attack-and-release napalm mode, back in the rubber factory in spirit if not tax bracket. Yes, well. Consider El Camino the aural equivalent of one of those Chrysler ""Imported from Detroit"" ads where a $47,000 car slowly rolls through one of the most devastated cities in America, a sign for 8 Mile Road glimpsed through tinted windows: the finest in luxury grit. Seedy, escapist camp, crass but expert, so expert. That they're the true victors of the 2000s garage explosion is no shock at all. Rock came back. Commerce never left.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16098-el-camino/,Nonesuch,2011.0
222,Gorillaz,The Singles Collection 2001-2011,"Electronic,Rock",7.9,November 29 2011,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"Happy birthday, Gorillaz; you have been a complete failure. Only by the terms of your original premise, mind you, which promised to be the sort of multimedia, multi-platform, multi-everything project that seemed like a real good idea circa Y2K. The novelty of the core Gorillaz gimmick-- an edgy, anime Banana Splits that gave interviews in character and played high-tech projection live shows in place of their creators, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett-- wore off sometime around the group's third video. But in a surprise upset, Gorillaz have evolved into something more than a cartoon prank or a circus-of-stars side-project, instead becoming the most effective achievement of Albarn's post-Blur career. Though a singles collection in 2011 is as anachronistic as the DVD-ROMs in the early Gorillaz back catalog, this one makes an excellent case for the substance behind the expired high concept of the  ""virtual band."" The decade covered here marked a mercurial time for Albarn, who celebrated the hiatus of Blur by eagerly shooting off in a dozen different directions. It was almost as though he set out to tick off every clichéd solo career path simultaneously: jamming melodica with musicians in Mali and the Congo, creating a remixer persona, putting together his fantasy-dub supergroup the Good, the Bad & the Queen, and exploring opera and film scoring. Gorillaz is far and away the most successful of these projects at the cash register, selling millions of records worldwide, headlining Glastonbury and Coachella, and holographically sharing a Grammys stage with Madonna. The group's artistic success has also kept pace with its commercial success, giving Albarn a way to combine most of his musical distractions into an oddly cohesive whole. In retrospect, the key to the project may have been enabling Albarn to abandon the frontman role and become the man behind the curtain, both figuratively and (up until recent live shows) literally. If you don't think that hiding place isn't therapeutic for Albarn, consider that Think Tank, the 2003 Blur album that essentially became an Albarn solo joint, also attempted to blend all of these interests, to less satisfying results. Taking the greatest-hits route through Gorillaz's career, it's impressive how few of the tracks sound dated. Genre-free zones were all the rage in 2001, with many groups aiming for futuristic blends of hip-hop, electronic, pop, and rock that sounded past their sell-by within a year. But apart from the Deltron 3030 sequel of ""Rock the House"" and the tacky remixes filling out this collection's runtime, even the earliest Gorillaz singles have avoided the erosion to retro. Credit an inspirational assist to Hewlett: His music-cliché characters may not have been able to sustain a satire or a storyline, but his trademark post-apocalyptic techno-dread was a suitable environmental muse for the urban Morricone that became the Gorillaz formula. And a surprisingly flexible formula it turned out to be, able to assimilate guest appearances as varied as the artisan-rap of De La Soul, the garble of Shaun Ryder, and the elder croon of Bobby Womack. Off the mic, Albarn found fruitful collaborations with producers-du-jour Dan the Automator and Danger Mouse, borrowing ideas without contaminating the project's core aesthetic. Behind the protective screen of his invited guests, Albarn used Gorillaz to find a new voice both as a songwriter and a vocalist. There's an unbroken evolutionary line connecting ""Tomorrow Comes Today"" to ""On Melancholy Hill"", and it's got an upward slope-- the latter is a moody-pop masterpiece that would sound completely foreign on any Blur LP.  The strictly singles format makes this collection an unbalanced summary, with arguably the weakest LP (2005's Demon Days) given the largest representation. But in its synthesis of Albarn's post-Blur interests, it's a fairly accurate snapshot of a busy decade for the singer, where he ironically found mid-life maturity inside a cartoon world.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16077-gorillaz-singles-collection/,Virgin,2011.0
223,Florence and the Machine,Ceremonials,Pop/R&B,6.0,November 3 2011,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"When I first saw Florence and the Machine two years ago at New York's cozy and beloved Bowery Ballroom, leader Florence Welch's voice was simply too loud for the room. She sounded massive, but shrill. Overpowering. If the show took place in an X-Men movie, the wind gushing from Welch's lungs would have propelled several patrons smashing through the Bowery's back window onto Delancey Street. The next time I encountered That Voice, it was five months later, in the relatively gigantic Terminal 5 on Manhattan's far west side. And while that venue is often knocked for its booming, detail-abolishing acoustics, and concrete-slab atmosphere, it was a much better fit for Welch, who hopped, ran, and wailed while 3,000 giddy fans looked on, awestruck. For this band and this singer, nothing could be too big. Or so it seemed. Growing up, Welch was met with stern eyes when she was caught singing her favorite hymns with a bit too much verve. Her unbridled talent is the type of thing producers of TV singing contests fantasize about. It's soulful. It's instant. It's blaring. On ""American Idol"", contestants like Welch are invariably deemed ""quirky"" and doomed to runner-up status. And though Welch is a more convincing Artist than even the best ""Idol"" has to offer, make no mistake that her voice-first delivery is perfectly tailored for a generation who grew up judging singers as much as they listened to them. Even the hopelessly hip crowd that showed up to see Welch at Vice's Creators Project event last month saved one of their biggest ovations for the moment when she held out one piercing note for an exaggerated period of time-- a primal sign of skill that banks on nothing less than sheer audacity. The same can be said of Florence and the Machine's second album, Ceremonials, which can feel like Welch simply holding out a single note at top volume for an hour. On paper, the album takes a wise path. After trying out a few different producers and styles-- garage-pop; vampy twinkle-pop; and tribal, mystic-pop-- on her debut, Lungs, Welch settles almost exclusively on the latter for Ceremonials, bringing along producer Paul Epworth, who was so good at the mystic stuff on the first record, to oversee the whole thing. So what we get is Florence trying very hard to top the gargantuan drums and cascading harps and chest-thumping choruses of Lungs hits like ""Cosmic Love"" and ""Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)"" on damn near every song. Instead of Lungs' largely charming yet discombobulating diversity, Ceremonials suffers from a repetitiveness that's akin to looking at a skyline filled with 100-story behemoths lined-up one after the other, blocking out everything but their own size. Some of these world wonders stand tall despite their surroundings. First single ""Shake It Out"", a stadium-willing anthem about getting past one's troubles, sets a new high for this group. As does the similarly barreling ""No Light, No Light"", which is one of the few tracks where Welch sets aside her usual flighty, dreamy, goth-y lyrical go-to's-- ghosts, graveyards, devils, angels, myths, drowning-- for something a bit more personal. ""Would you leave me, if I told you what I'd become,"" she sings during the track's magisterial bridge, ""'Cause it's so easy to sing it to a crowd/ But it's so hard, my love/ To say it to you out loud."" The lines double as a snippet of self-criticism; perhaps Welch finds it ""so easy"" to sing her tunes to thousands because they often lack an individual touch that could send them even further skyward-- the same touch that comes so naturally to fellow UK chart queen Adele. But by the midway point of the LP, its endless crescendos start bleeding into each other, and the loudness soon tires itself out. The few tracks that deviate from the heavens-broken-open formula hardly curb frustrations. The haughty ""Breaking Down"" could be an outtake fromÂ MGMT's career-stalling Congratulations, dirge-y ""Seven Devils"" aims for Beelzebub but is about as haunting as a toddler with a pitchfork. In what's becoming an increasingly annoying problem in this era of iTunes bonus tracks and myriad deluxe editions, it's the extras not included on the proper album that offer reasonable outs for Florence's Big issues. ""Remain Nameless"" replaces the record's corporate-rock drums and overzealous whoosh with an electronic minimalism similar to Welch's pals the xx. The song's allowed to breathe, and is all the better for it. Other bonuses include a few demos of some of the record's huger cuts (and the term ""demo"" is relative here-- these stripped-back tracks are still pristine). Backed by only acoustic instrumentation, we finally hear the creases in Welch's voice that the album whitewashes at every turn. ""I don't want your future, don't need your past/ One bright moment, is all I ask,"" sings Welch on choir-aided closer ""Leave My Body"". Ceremonials is so hell-bent on providing such ""bright moments""-- that flash of overwhelming emotion resulting from ramped-up strings or a frantic harp or a particularly audacious vocal run-- that it never zooms out to consider its own listenability. Welch is 25, and she's likely chuffed at the thought of bringing these massive songs to equally immense crowds at festivals all over the world for the next two years. And that's where many of these tracks will have the greatest chance to thrive-- in the open, with heads as far as one can see.

224,The Beach Boys,The Smile Sessions,Rock,10.0,November 2 2011,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"It's a rite of passage for students of pop music history: At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. The record that convinces most is Pet Sounds, that understated 1966 masterpiece that articulates a specific kind of teenage longing and loneliness like nothing before or since. Once you've absorbed that record, you find yourself going back through songs like ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""The Warmth of the Sun"", and ""I Get Around"", finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship. As you make these discoveries, you come to learn about the auteur at the center of it all, Brian Wilson, who shouldered the burden of being the creative force in one of the most successful and musically ambitious pop bands of the era. And then you find out about SMiLE. Conceived, recorded, and ultimately abandoned in 1966 and 1967, SMiLE was to be something like Brian's Sgt. Pepper's, his attempt to make the great art-pop album of the era. He followed his muse to the ends of the earth, putting a grand piano in a massive living room sandbox, outfitting another room with an Arabian tent, making session musicians wear fireman's hats for the recording of a song about the elements, freaking out when an actual fire broke out down the street from the studio around the time of recording of said track, and, no surprise, taking enough drugs to amplify the whole scene and turn it into something terrifying. But the record was not to be. The music recorded for SMiLE was too far-out for the rest of the band (lead singer Mike Love hated the lyrics penned by Wilson's collaborator, Van Dyke Parks, an opinion he still holds) and Wilson had trouble finishing tracks. Eventually, he shelved the record for good and the band issued the low-key, weird, and supremely stoned Smiley Smile. By setting the record aside, Wilson became afraid to indulge his talent, and his contributions to the Beach Boys would never again be central to the band. If you're wired a certain way, once you learn the SMiLE story, you long to hear the album that never was. It looms out there in imagination, an album that lends itself to storytelling and legend, like the aural equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster. And the songs from the sessions that eventually made it out on other records-- ""Surf's Up"", ""Cabin Essence"", ""Heroes and Villains"", and more, including material on the 1993 Beach Boys career-overview box Good Vibrations-- were so brilliant that the lack of proper release becomes almost painful. So you might start hunting down bootlegs, poring over the fragments, and finding competing edits and track sequences, which only feeds your desire to know what the ""real"" SMiLE could have been. Only in 2003, when long-time Beach Boys fanatic and tape trader Darian Sahanaja and his band the Wondermints collaborated with Brian on a live version of SMiLE and 2004's Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE album did the lost record assume a definitive shape. But as exciting as that record was at the time, the lure of the originals never went away. So there was naturally a great deal of excitement when, early this year, we heard that the original tapes were being assembled for official release. This epic story finally has an ending, and it's a very happy one. As archival projects go, SMiLE is as surprising, generous, and successful as anything in recent memory. The version of the album, based on the Wilson/Wondermints sequence, feels remarkably complete and whole, even though it was largely built from unfinished scraps. During this period, Wilson and Parks were working on an enormous canvas. They were using words and music to tell a story of America. If the early-60s Beach Boys were about California, that place where the continent ends and dreams are born, SMiLE is about how those dreams were first conceived. Moving west from Plymouth Rock, we view cornfields and farmland and the Chicago fire and jagged mountains, the Grand Cooley Damn, the California coast-- and we don't stop until we hit Hawaii. Cowboy songs, cartoon Native American chants, barroom rags, jazzy interludes, rock'n'roll, sweeping classical touches, street-corner doo-wop, and town square barbershop quartet are swirled together into an ever-shifting technicolor dream. Befitting an album concerned with history, SMiLE feels strangely adrift from time, using the technology of the day and an avant-garde approach to pop song form to make the past look both familiar and strange. In 1966 and 1967, old-timey music, if you squinted at it just so, could be imbued with a haze of psychedelia. And this is a deeply psychedelic album, though disorientation mostly comes from its juxtapositions, how the orchestral miniatures (or ""feels,"" as Wilson called his modular melodic ideas) bump into each other and find their way from one song to the next, the ""Heroes and Villains"" refrain here, the ""Child Is Father of the Man"" refrain there. The 2004 sequence divided the album into three ""movements,"" with songs connected thematically, and this reissue wisely puts each on its own side of vinyl (if you want only the record proper, the 2xLP, with key outtakes added on the fourth side, is absolutely the way to go). Each movement has at least one pop masterpiece. On the first, there's ""Heroes and Villains"" and ""Cabin Essence"", both exploring western themes in Parks' bent style. Here and especially on side two's ""Surf's Up"", the level of Parks' writing is astounding. He had the sound-driven jumble of imagery of contemporaneous Dylan, but his words were far tighter and more disciplined. He also understood the power of a good pun. Sounds are slurred together to take on new meaning through clusters that extended beyond the spaces between the words. So, ""The music hall, a costly bow,"" in ""Surf's Up"" also sounds like, ""The music holocaust,"" and lines like, ""canvas the town and brush the backdrop,"" layer image atop image with breathtaking efficiency. Each side's arc also serves to push forward the record as a whole. Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE has made this sequencing seem canonical, and there were enough raw materials in the vault available to piece together a worthy approximation. Once in a while, you can hear a stitch or shift that would have no doubt been done over later, but those moments are rare and ultimately only add to the record's charm. By the time the tense and throbbing neo-classical piece ""Fire (Mrs. O'Leary's Cow)"" comes along in the third movement and then leads into ""Love to Say Dada"" (mostly an instrumental, it was meant to have lyrics; they were added for Brian Wilson Presents Smile, the song titled ""In Blue Hawaii"") and then to the extended ""Good Vibrations"", the strength of the album as a full piece is staggering. But part of the allure of SMiLE will always be the pieces, and the deluxe box has a lot of them. There's almost a full disc of ""Heroes and Villains"" fragments and another entire CD with bits of ""Good Vibrations"". Given the nature of this release, the extras are illuminating, arguably more essential than most outtakes included with bonus albums. Having source materials hints at roads not taken, and also offers insight into the difficulty of actually creating a record on this scale, given how much we've heard about all the bouncing and layering that SMiLE entailed (the complexity of which is partly to blame for the project's being late and ultimately abandoned) and how many of the basic tracks were recorded live in the studio with a dozen or more musicians at once. There were only four and eight tracks to work with on the tape of the time, so one of them would need multiple instruments just to have voices and overdubs added later. Not to mention that these modular sections were eventually going to be stitched together with tape and razorblades. Beyond the fragments, there are brilliant single performances, like the two demo versions of ""Surf's Up"". To my ears, the song is a high-water mark of pop songwriting, positively haunting with its melodic twists and turns. And Brian's vocal performances, with wild leaps into the upper reaches of his falsetto, give the track an almost unbearable poignancy. It's incredible to think that ""Surf's Up"" would remain in the vault for five years, until it appeared in re-worked form on the 1971 album of the same name. On the sessions material, you also get to hear Wilson running the show in the studio, and apart from a few asides where he talks about hash and LSD, he sounds excited, patient, and kind, offering encouragement about mood, timing, and tempo. He surely wasn't an easy guy to work for, but hearing his voice on these tapes, it's remarkable how together he seems and how willing he is to work with these musicians to make something great. Most of all, his studio patter provides a nice counterbalance to SMiLE's prevailing narrative, of a crazed genius unraveling in the face of trying to create his masterpiece. We love crack-up stories. There's something in the Western psyche that loves to romanticize the alleged connection between madness and genius. And someone like Wilson-- fragile, paranoid, childlike, and dreamy-- fits one template of the crazed genius to a T. Never mind that he was a student of music, put in twice as many hours of extremely hard work as anyone else in the band, and relied greatly on collaboration and outside inspiration. When thinking of SMiLE, the guy in the fireman's hat thinking his music could burn down buildings is who we remember. But now we have the full picture. SMiLE was never finished, and it still isn't, but we can safely say this is as close as it'll ever come. What's here is brilliant, beautiful, and, most importantly, finally able to stand tall on its own.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16000-the-smile-sessions/,Capitol,2011.0
225,Radiohead,TKOL RMX 1234567,Rock,6.0,October 10 2011,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Radiohead has a reputation for studio perfectionism and have been known to tinker with arrangements for years on tour, but they've rarely delivered an album as obsessive as The King of Limbs. Their most single-minded record, TKOL is an itchy and restless foray into making songs out of almost nothing except whizzing bits of rhythm. Even accounting for the brief dip into balladry toward the end, bands don't generally come up with something this uniformly dense and tense by tweaking over multiple sessions. But as longtime students of Can's Holger Czukay, Radiohead also know that fevered and compulsive-sounding records can be the product of painstaking editing, stitching multiple takes into one bristling rush. Little of the band's careful detail work, or their general sense of passion, makes it onto TKOL RMX 1234567, a listenable but ultimately bloodless collection of remixes of songs from The King of Limbs. Whether intimidated by the thought of reinterpreting a band renowned for experimentation or unsure how to take apart and reassemble the band's tightly-wound recent material, too many of these 19 artists seem content to settle for bland beauty, or simply apply their usual sonic tricks without pushing themselves in the slightest. The highlights are the tracks that take TKOL's joy in rhythm to new places. Acclaimed UK neo-rave producer Lone turns out a typically brilliant take on ""Feral"" that somehow keeps the original percussion pattern intact while recasting it as an early-1990s ambient house record, giving us TKOL RMX's most bizarrely enjoyable image: Radiohead gone to Ibiza. Pearson Sound, the alter-ego of dubstep progenitor and Hessle Audio label head Ramadanman, pulls a fantastic bait-and-switch, opening with an extended drone intro that shifts into a punchy mix of early Detroit techno and jagged jungle breaks. These two, along with a small handful of other acts-- Anstam squeezing drama from just a handful of skeletal drum patterns, SBTRKT recasting Thom Yorke as a forlorn garage diva, Caribou returning to his roots as a left-field beatmaker-- are fearless enough to recreate the feeling of TKOL in a new form. And a few do get by on sheer loveliness alone, like Four Tet spinning ""Separator"" into an old-school IDM lullaby. But a far greater number of these remixes flatten out the complexity of TKOL's grooves in favor of commonplace arrangements. Instead of Radiohead's pinpoint editing, we get generically ""wonky"" takes on house and techno filled with stuttering drums and formless synth goo, whether aggressive like Blawan's take on ""Bloom"" or shoegaze-lite like Nathan Fake doing ""Morning Mr Magpie"". And some of the most touted names fail to deliver the craft we've come to expect from them: On his ""Bloom"" rework, Jamie xx ditches his minimalist gloom-funk for gauzy, forgettable ambience. More ethereal or abstract remixes of such anxious music could have been interesting, but few seem up to the task here, instead doling out placid and perfectly pleasant background noise. For a while, until its complex grooves revealed the songs beneath, I dismissed TKOL as a brave but opaque attempt to remake Radiohead as just individual components in a roiling rhythm machine. In other words, it seemed like the perfect Radiohead album for remixing. Who would better understand that everything-is-rhythm impulse than dance music producers? If anything, wouldn't they take it further, make it wilder, go funkier? The lack of rhythmic invention here could be forgiven if most of TKOL RMX displayed any kind of invention. Failing to match TKOL's peculiar vibe-- aggressive rhythms made out of dainty bits of digital detritus, robotically repetitive yet humanly off-kilter, parched thickets of drumming graced with fleeting moments of melodic relief -- is one thing. Failing to replace it with anything that similarly rewards listening deeper and harder is quite another.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15905-tkol-rmx-1234567/,XL,2011.0
226,Miles Davis,"The Bootleg Series, Volume 1: Live in Europe 1967",Jazz,9.0,October 6 2011,Hank Shteamer,Contributor,"The Miles Davis quintet of the mid-to-late 1960s occupies a weird place in the trumpeter's canon. Critics (this one included) will tell you that it isn't just the best band Miles ever led, but one of the choicest small groups in jazz history. If you're not a jazz nerd, though, you may not know it existed. This is because the outfit-- rounded out by tenor saxist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams-- doesn't register on Miles' pop-cultural timeline. The group issued a string of brilliant studio LPs during its 1965-68 run, yet there's no Kind of Blue or Bitches Brew among them; by this period, Miles had pushed way beyond the sumptuously chilled-out sound of the former but hadn't arrived at the murky psych-jazz of the latter. So if the Shorter/Hancock/Carter/Williams band (often called Miles' second great quintet, in deference to his stellar 1950s group) was transitional, a checkpoint between consensus masterpieces, why should you care that there's a new box set featuring previously unreleased live recordings from this time? Given that nearly every microphase of Davis' career has been expanded into box form by this point-- ask an expert before gifting a random one at Christmas-- casual consumers are right to be suspicious. But Live in Europe 1967, which presents five concerts from October and November of that year on three great-sounding CDs and one DVD, is no footnote: This set, Volume 1 in a new Davis Bootleg Series built on the Bob Dylan model, offers a chance to hear one of the greatest bandleaders of the 20th century push his collaborators into a creative frenzy and be pushed back in return. Aside from Carter, each of these players would become giants of electric jazz (Davis and Hancock transitioned into something like pop stardom), and the period documented on this set represents their farewell to their bebop roots: both an ecstatic celebration and a ballsy deconstruction of how small-group jazz had been played for the previous two decades. Live in Europe 1967 won't soundtrack any romantic dinners or inspire dorm-room acid trips, but it does show off the central thrill of jazz-- spontaneous interplay among dangerously skilled players-- as well as almost any other collection you could name. That ""among"" is key. As much as this set testifies to the leader's own vision, the real takeaway is the virtuosity of other musicians, and how Miles' anti-hierarchical aesthetic spurred them toward the riskiest, most engaged performances of their careers. No player on this set reaches more than Tony Williams. A famously precocious drumming prodigy-- he first recorded with Miles in 1963 at age 17-- he was exactly the kind of daredevil Miles was looking for, a player naturally inclined toward pure outrageousness. (By 1967, he'd already explored cutting-edge improvisation on deeply unusual masterworks such as Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch.) Williams is in particularly wired form here on the version of ""Footprints"" from November 2 in Copenhagen (disc two). During Miles' trumpet solo, the drummer casts himself as Donkey Kong to Davis' Mario, throwing out flaming barrels for the leader to navigate; Williams keeps time on the ride cymbal, but runs a near-constant interference pattern of asymmetrical fills and swelling cymbal flurries. (You can hear the legacy of Williams' pot-stirring percussion style, rarely better documented than on Live in Europe 1967, in players like Deerhoof's Greg Saunier, who loves to slide around a song's central pulse, sending bits of rhythmic shrapnel flying at his bandmates.) As dazzling as Williams sounds, what really catches the ear is how the entire band provides the improvisational boldness that Miles was after. On the Copenhagen ""Footprints"", Herbie Hancock plays like a deranged outsider artist. Instead of providing a sturdy foundation underneath Wayne Shorter's saxophone solo, he offers squiggly little phrases, like jumbled fragments from a 20th-century classical score; on the outro, he answers the horn players' theme statement with a mocking paraphrase. Ron Carter, meanwhile, constantly reconfigures the piece's waltzing bassline, jumping between half-time and double-time, and mixing in percussive slaps and low, droney digressions. These performances represent an upending of the soloist-and-background model of small-group jazz up to this point. Miles' second great quintet wasn't the first to play this way; by 1967, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, and Cecil Taylor had each exploded the conventions of 1940s and 1950s jazz in their own ways. Yet none of these other artists had figured out how to combine deep, risky interactivity with such sustained coherence. Many of the pieces on Live in Europe 1967 play like cooperative action paintings, with everyone allowed but no one entitled to be the center of attention at any given time, and with the overarching logic of the compositions keeping chaos in check. It's at this stage, just before the quintet's dissolution-- over the next two years, as Miles engaged with electric jazz, Carter would exit, followed by Williams and Hancock-- that the conversation is at its most lively and lucid. Crucially, though, freedom, as it was interpreted by this band, didn't always equal volume and density. Some of the strongest moments on Live in Europe 1967 are also the calmest. During ""Masqualero"" from the November 6 Paris concert (disc three), as Miles plays a poignant, slow-building solo, Hancock settles into a haunting, repetitive figure and Williams quiets to a whisper, marking faint tempo on the hi-hat. Later, when Hancock's solo begins, Williams drops out entirely, leaving the pianist and Carter to play a delicate, free-floating duo. During the same set, on ""Walkin'""-- a staple of Davis' 50s repertoire-- Williams and Carter guide Shorter into an up-tempo frenzy and then gradually fade to silence. The saxophonist moves into a rare unaccompanied passage, playing an abstracted kind of bebop, full of tumbling phrases and murmuring digressions. By late 1967, thanks in large part to John Coltrane (who had passed away in July) and mavericks such as Albert Ayler, shrieking, high-density free jazz was in full flower. As you can hear in Live in Europe 1967's many boldly stripped-down moments, Miles and his band were aiming for a different kind of freedom, one where aggression coexisted with near-stillness. Funk was in the mix too: During the October 28 ""Masqualero"" in Antwerp (disc one), Williams and Carter keep up an infectious Latin pulse behind the soloists, providing a danceable base for Shorter to tear off his heated phrases and also foreshadowing Davis' groove-based experiments, which would begin in earnest on 1969's In a Silent Way. Miles clearly savored this band's broad dynamic and emotional range, and constructed its sets accordingly. Unlike the quintet's studio recordings, the concerts on Live in Europe 1967 take the form of unbroken medleys. On four out of the five sets here, the tempestuous ""Footprints"", a Shorter original, segues into the Thelonious Monk favorite ""'Round Midnight"", which begins each time as a beautifully sparse dialogue between Davis and Hancock. Other transitions keep these long sets feeling brisk. In Antwerp, a lengthy version of Miles' hard-swinging, midtempo ""No Blues"", gives way to a turbulent three-minute sprint through Hancock's ""Riot""; in Paris, ""No Blues"" snaps into Shorter's moody, Spanish-inflected ""Masqualero"", a striking shift that immediately reengages the ear. Live in Europe 1967 marks the first time we're hearing this band engage with such a wide range of material; a previous second-great-quintet live box, The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965, featured mainly well-worn jazz standards. As much microscopic variety as there is in these shows, it's important to note that Live in Europe 1967 documents a single tour with a more or less fixed set list. Davis did vary the repertoire occasionally-- trying out ""Walkin'"" and the standard ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" in Paris-- but buyers interested in a more diverse overview of what this band could do might be better off picking up one of their studio releases (E.S.P., from 1965, and Nefertiti, recorded just a few months before the shows heard here, are both great starting points). Don't let the repetition scare you away, though. All five concerts here have their own rewards and idiosyncrasies; the best path through the box is to treat each segment like the concert it originally was and savor it individually. The DVD, which documents two shows not featured on the CDs, is a sharp addition. There's a bit of arty treatment-- often two players appear superimposed in the same frame-- but on the whole, these are tasteful black-and-white concert films that put you in the midst of the onstage action. You see the youthful Williams bearing down fiercely on his ride, Shorter entering a closed-eyes trance while playing, and Hancock cocking his ear, tuning in to his bandmates' improvisations with genuine curiosity. And in the middle of it all is Miles: his usual, unflappable self. This is one of our last glimpses of the trumpeter in pre-psychedelic mode; the sequined pants and wraparound shades would arrive by 1969, as Miles flipped for Jimi and Sly and started co-billing with future rock legends at the Fillmore and the Isle of Wight, but here he sports natty suits (the sidemen wore tuxes), embodying the same model of 50s cool that won the trumpeter a mention in a 1960 Esquire list of ""Some of the Best-Dressed Men in the United States."" That shift in fashion wasn't just superficial; Miles' music changed drastically in the period following Live in Europe 1967. LPs such as 1969's In a Silent Way and 1970's Bitches Brew are still some of the most compelling jazz-crossover experiments ever attempted. And Miles' sidemen would make equally important contributions to the movement that came to be known as fusion: Shorter with the vibrant Weather Report, Hancock with his funky Mwandishi and Headhunters bands, and Williams with Lifetime, one of the grittiest and heaviest of the early jazz-rock groups. These impending transitions are part of why Live in Europe 1967 is essential: You get to hear exactly how these virtuosos were behaving just before the big change occurred. They were still operating in an old mode, small-group acoustic jazz, but they were interrogating it relentlessly, seeing how far they could stretch its conventions without ditching them altogether. Before they could break into the larger world of pop, they had to reach jazz nirvana, and that's what they attain on Live in Europe 1967. The aesthetic here is less easily definable than those heard on Kind of Blue and Bitches Brew, but it's no less significant. At its heart, jazz thrives on bold, sensitive interaction in the moment, and Live in Europe 1967 represents the pinnacle of that practice.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15887-the-bootleg-series-volume-1-live-in-europe-1967/,"Columbia,Legacy",2011.0
227,J. Cole,Cole World: The Sideline Story,Rap,6.1,September 30 2011,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"J. Cole is the kind of rapper who worries aloud, and frequently, if he's getting too deep for his own songs. A St. John's University magna cum laude graduate raised in poverty by a single mother, Cole distinguished himself in his early career as much through effort as talent. Over a string of fiercely earnest, frequently impressive mixtapes, he rapped in writerly thickets in which the semicolons and embedded clauses were audible, and he produced all his own tracks. He became a leading light of the conscious-rap crowd, who, always eager for a viable mainstream entrant in rap's ongoing culture wars, fervently embraced him. And then, perhaps inevitably, Jay-Z swooped down and signed him. The resulting major-label debut, Cole World: The Sideline Story, which finally saw release this week, is shaping up to be an actual Big Moment for Cole: Despite a tepid radio presence, it is projected to sell nearly 250,000 copies. Those are startling first-week numbers for a new rapper these days, and they assure that J. Cole will get at least a partial promenade through the spotlight. People appear to care deeply about this guy. But it's difficult to imagine why from the evidence of this studiously bland and compromise-riddled record, which seems to be searching for the meeting point of every conceivable middle. About half the album bears Cole's production signature: a glimmering update on 1990s jazz-rap, spiked with live-sounding boom-bap drums. As a rap aesthetic, it's about as rigidly conservative as they come. But Cole is admirably committed to it, and he fleshes it out with surprising musical detail-- backup vocals, comping jazz guitars, lots and lots of grand piano. The songs that stick to this template feel warm, pleasant, and Cole-ish. The rest of Cole World is a 2011-era pop-rap project with a varying success rate: the madcap, syncopated single ""Can't Get Enough"" feels like a lost transmission from 2002-era rap radio, and it succeeds only insofar as it compels you to imagine how much better an '03-era T.I., or even N.O.R.E., would have finessed the beat than does Cole, who deflates the track's bounce. It doesn't help that Cole brings the least-flavorful bars of his career to his debut, aiming, most likely, for something more universal than his diaristic mixtapes. The few glints we get of his personal life are intriguing: ""Lost Ones"" is a slippery and well-conceived, two-sided argument between Cole and his baby mother over whether they will keep the child. ""Breakdown"" affectingly recounts his late-in-life reunion with his father. But otherwise he seems to be playing by implied, major-label debut rules: keep it simple, slow it down, don't lose anyone. The result is like glutinous paste that results from mashing together Drake, Kanye, and Big K.R.I.T. and straining out what makes them interesting. Jay himself, the benefactor figure, pops up twice, and both times his presence subtly undermines the marquee star. On his guest verse for ""Mr. Nice Watch,"" he flexes his double -time flow and coolly blows Cole out of the water. He's heard again on the intro to ""Rise and Shine,"" musing in a sampled snippet from his 2000 concert film Backstage on his ideal signee: rapping over his breakfast cereal, gunning for Jay's own spot. ""I'mma find him, though, and sign him; I don't want no problems,"" he says and there is a startlingly predatory ring to his laugh. J. Cole certainly posed no threat to Jay-Z's crown; he's too humble and lacks charisma. But maybe the next up-and-coming rapper to successfully forge and remain in his own lane is the one who refuses Jay's help.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15879-j-cole-cole-world-the-sideline-story/,"Columbia,Roc Nation",2011.0
228,Nirvana,Nevermind [20th Anniversary Edition],Rock,10.0,September 27 2011,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Despite its tremendous influence on the mainstream rock that followed, it's hard to think of another album that sounds much like Nirvana's Nevermind, a record with so much more pop and punk punch than any music it inspired. Of course, no diamond-certified, canonical treasure hitting the two-decade mark can be left well enough alone in 2011-- especially one that changed the lives of a lot people now approaching middle age, with the discretionary income to prove it. After all, ""super deluxe"" reissues of classic albums don't even have to be tied to an anniversary these days. But Nevermind is 20 this week, still a pretty respectable number in a world where any milestone marks an excuse to shift a few more units. The only question is whether these reissues-- a single-disc remaster, a 2xCD ""deluxe"" version, and a 4xCD+DVD ""super-deluxe"" edition-- are that rare essential repurchase that makes you hear an album you've possibly exhausted in new ways, or if it's just another mediocre jumble of odds and ends that inadvertently reveals the flaws and blemishes carefully excised from the original 12-song set. Sadly, both expanded versions fall into the latter category, with material ranging from ""interesting"" to ""historical curiosity"" to ""of zero value to even superfans."" But this mish-mash of sketches, practice-space woodshedding, and alternate-but-not-very mixes does help explain what makes Nevermind so unique. Nirvana certainly never made another album like it. The precocious Bleach still has its partisans, folks who think its primal bash-and-howl is the be-all-end-all of rock, while In Utero stands as the band's most harrowing statement, where it's a toss-up as to whether the riffs or the lyrics hurt more. But Nevermind was and remains an unrepeatable object. It retains the gleeful pummel of the first album while hinting at the bleakness of the third. Yet there's also a concision and clarity that Nirvana hadn't quite mastered on the gnarly-by-necessity Bleach and wouldn't allow themselves on the stark and caustic In Utero. Nirvana began their career with no illusions about their chances for mass success and ended it by seeing just how abrasive a platinum-selling band could get away with being. But when they got their chance at the brass ring, they went at it with a bubblegum band's canniness, however much Cobain shit on the shiny final product after the fact. Andy Wallace's radio-ready mix certainly helped sharpen this potentially no-concessions, indie-to-major leap into an obvious commercial proposition. But even if they'd settled on producer Butch Vig's slightly less slick mixes-- made as a reference for the band and identified on the super deluxe edition's third disc as the ""Devonshire mixes""-- Nevermind would likely have fared well in the charts, since these early passes aren't far from Wallace's infamous high-gloss version. Listening in hindsight, though, they have the woozy effect of feeling just slightly off, leaving you to focus only on what's missing. The box set does make clear that Nirvana honed these songs over a long period. Listening to the various sessions leading up to the one that gave us the album we know-- especially the nearly unlistenable ""boombox"" mixes of early demos-- you learn very quickly that these songs didn't arrive perfectly formed in one sustained burst of inspiration. The hours of rehearsals and the expensive time spent tinkering in the studio shaped them into classics. It helped that there are songs on Nevermind that might appeal to people who've never heard a hardcore album in their lives, who might have even (gasp!) kinda liked the glossier hard-rock bands whose era largely ended with the rise of grunge. Moving away from the heavy-at-all-costs sound he'd always been both enamored with and suspicious of, Cobain worked diligently on his big hooks and decided to stop smothering his natural melodic gifts under so much self-conscious sludge. The key was that Nirvana, unlike many of their indie peers, didn't assume that intensity was incompatible with polish. Cobain's discomfort could be unnerving because it sounded as unmediated as anything allowed on the radio could get. There was too much pop-rock study involved to claim Nevermind as some kind of art brut document of one dude's unraveling. Confronted with something like ""Polly"", Cobain's distress was obvious in 1991, long before his shotgun-assisted exit. But it wasn't the way Nevermind exposed Cobain's psychic wounds that provided support for those who related to him. It was the fact that, fucked up as he was, Cobain still found pleasure in rock's most emphatic clichés and bent them to his own never-quite-smirking ends. He snuck into the spotlight while remaining an alienated weirdo, but for a while there, you suspected he was enjoying the attention, even if he knew that it was all a joke to be taken about as seriously as high school cliquishness. ""Territorial Pissings"" is as raw as any punk song I know, but it actually found its way into the hands of suburban tweens. How good must that have felt, to be responsible for such a thing? Even as they moved toward the mainstream, Nirvana were trying shit that no one would have called an easy route to success. Nevermind is drenched in the filthy Pacific Northwest roar that slapped Cobain into action as a teen, but it's as catchy as any of the radio giants that caught his ear as a kid. It's driven by pain as naked and personal as the riot grrrl bands whose company he kept and as fuck-around goofy as the Seattle contemporaries who both reveled in and mercilessly parodied machismo. And despite the fact that none of those modes would seem to fit together on the same album, let alone all of them, it's all hammered into a still-disarming whole, a collection of anthems that retain the idiosyncrasies of the very weird band that made them. It helped that Cobain had yet to be disabused of the idea that you could be an idiosyncratic indie kid and a rock star without compromising on either front. That's probably why the bonus material here feels less like a revelation and more like the kind of peek-behind-the-curtain that you wind up regretting. Nevermind is basically a great fake-out. It presents itself as an off-the-cuff explosion, a from-the-gut expression of realness and energy in the grand punk tradition, but it was actually the product of a shit ton of hard work. If you don't hold with the first-take-is-the-best-take philosophy, your respect for Cobain may actually increase when you realize how dedicated he was to getting every element right. Listening to him fumbling his way toward greatness on the ""boombox"" mixes of songs like ""Come as You Are"" and ""Something in the Way"" or hearing a newly cemented group working out the kinks in their interplay in the studio, you may also realize that you don't want to hear the missteps and rewrites and second guessing that went into the perfect-as-is final product. The ""boombox"" mixes, Devonshire mixes, and Smart Sessions (early Vig-produced takes recorded with drummer Chad Channing that were initially intended for release on a second album for Sub Pop) are largely work tapes. Listening to them feels like studying every unused scrap of a film classic that someone managed to sneak out of the editing room, which is about as fun as that description makes them sound. If you've always been suspicious of the album's production sheen, there's no Holy Grail here that's going to give you the raw take you're looking for. For all its finessing and tweaking, though, Nevermind is still a thousand times closer to the unpremeditated intensity of Cobain's D.I.Y. days than any of the post-grunge rockers who claimed it as an influence. I defy you to listen to any of the live performances on this edition-- the only essential extras, though less uncomfortably intense than 1994's MTV Unplugged set and less definitive and uniformly powerful than 2009's release of their king-making set at the 1992 Reading Festival-- and not hear a ragged, joyful, charismatic band that makes those inert, angst-ridden followers sound like they come from another aesthetic universe. That charisma is a big reason why Nevermind remains a 10. But in-concert takes on ""Sliver"" and ""Been a Son"" that are the third most thrilling live versions officially available on CD? It's not as if all this ""exclusive"" dreck-- most of which has been floating around on bootlegs and .zip files and YouTube for eons-- will permanently dull the excitement of the Nevermind, but trying to swallow it all might put you off the album itself for a long while. If you're truly interested in hearing this stuff, the two-disc deluxe set is easily the better deal, giving you a little hint of the various stages of Nevermind's construction without wearing you out the way the four-disc set will. But if you really want to celebrate the 20th, you'll be better off just giving the original album a few spins. Despite how much better-left-forgotten material is being offered up here as essential, there's still more life in the real Nevermind than anything that's attempted to replicate its attack since.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15854-nevermind-20th-anniversary-edition/,Geffen,2011.0
229,Laura Marling,A Creature I Don't Know,Folk/Country,7.6,September 13 2011,Joshua Love,Contributor,"Laura Marling's music feels timeless. I don't mean ""timeless"" in the sense that people refer to, say, Adele or Duffy as timeless, when really they're really just evoking a very specific time that happens to be distant. Marling evokes other artists, too, but they're spread out over the past five decades of pop and rock, from Joni Mitchell, Fairport Convention, and Leonard Cohen to Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, and PJ Harvey. Still, her songs feel divorced from time, lacking clues or signposts to indicate whether her stories and scenes might be set 500 years ago or yesterday. Marling's first two albums were noteworthy in large part for their precociousness. Her newest is A Creature I Don't Know, and it's her first that can't benefit from stunning you with its level of maturity. This is simply who Marling is right now-- an artist deeply invested in archetypes, one who doesn't muck about with the details of 21st-century life in her explorations of desire, loss, and understanding. Certainly it's a brave artistic approach, this notion of wrestling with only the most primal states of being and ignoring all the fleeting fads and noise that make up the rest of our world. At the same time, such a large part of songwriting is making human connections, and often with Marling it's not entirely clear whether these songs are springing forth from a 21-year-old Englishwoman or some deathless, wandering spirit. Her reliance on heavily symbolic language and lack of interest in putting more of her personality into her compositions creates frustrating paradoxes: Her music's intimate yet distant, earthy yet seemingly not of this earth. That said, the success of each song on A Creature I Donâ€™t Know hinges on how well Marling inhabits the role she's given herself. Fortunately, while she may not be a particularly revealing performer, she's an extremely commanding one. Marling's tendency is to be stark and direct, and her presence carries equal weight whether she's accompanied by little more than piano or guitar (the unnervingly hushed, death-obsessed ""Night After Night"") or a churning instrumental malestrom (the Neil Young-worthy ""The Beast""). On ""The Muse"", ""Salinas"", and the Zeppelin III-goes-hoedown single ""Sophia"", Marling's scarily impressive self-possession actually spills over into a kind of wickedly controlling glee, as she adds domineering theatrical flourishes to certain words and phrases in a manner that comes reasonably close to matching Harvey during her mid-1990s reign. Marling may spend the majority of these songs and several others struggling to find wisdom and peace in the face of trials brought on by lust, money, and death, but she almost always sounds like she already has all the answers.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15808-a-creature-i-dont-know/,Ribbon Music,2011.0
230,Thundercat,The Golden Age of Apocalypse,"Jazz,Pop/R&B",8.1,September 2 2011,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"As far as debut albums go, the The Golden Age of Apocalypse is definitely a head-spinner, precisely the sort of improbable hybrid from an almost-unknown artist that the Brainfeeder crew has come to specialize in over the last couple years. After all, it's not every day that you find a record that simultaneously recalls the laid-back sprawl of Erykah Badu's Return of the Ankh and the bustling mania of Mouse on Mars' Iaora Tahiti, the slick jazz futurism of Herbie Hancock's Headhunters and the gentle homespun soul of Bill Withers' Just As I Am. This is the sort of densely layered, expertly played, genre-crossing marvel that could easily turn bloated or excessive, or come off like a display of pure skill with little heart behind it. But Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner seems more interested in using his well-honed chops to turn out sunny (if bogglingly detailed) ear-candy than he is in crafting big statements (despite the album's portentous title). Co-produced with Brainfeeder major domo (and Thundercat pal) Flying Lotus, Apocalypse has the digital sheen of many FlyLo productions. But Bruner’s experience as an in-demand rock and soul bassist gives the album a live band's freedom of movement, one that's closer to the fusion records that reared him than the sequenced rhythms that have come to define dance music, even at its most out-there. After a silly and nostalgia-inducing sample from the 1980s cartoon that gave Bruner his pseudonym, ""Daylight"" is the album's true opener, another in Brainfeeder’s line of shouldn't-work-but-does experimental beat confections. It merges the bustling energy of 21st-century left-field electronic music (crunchy mutant techno rhythms, a mix saturated with whimsical sound effects) with the floating-on-a-cloud airiness of 1970s soul (vaporous falsetto vocals, bright-but-wistful melodies). It really does feel like a long lost Mouse on Mars track, as if that most playful of German electronic acts had called up a member of the Soulquarians camp at the same time that Common decided to collaborate with Stereolab. That's all a bit of bait-and-switch, though. There's no doubt plenty of Brainfeeder's psychedelic and IDM-like attention to sonic detail at various points on Apocalypse, along with nods to the fractured rhythms of London's broken beat scene and the earlier West Coast post-rap experimentation of Stones Throw. But like the latter L.A. pioneers, Thundercat takes avant electronic music's futuristic sound-sculpting and reconnects it with the history of African-American pop. He's particularly smitten with that moment in the 70s when soul music got looser and smoother and more electronic, and electric jazz started taming the wildness of improvisation with the slickness and structure of the pop song. Bruner's not beholden to the days of fusion past, of course. He takes detours into smoothly gliding 80s synth-funk (""Walkin'"") and queasy prog ambience (""Mystery Machine [The Golden Age of Apocalypse]""). But still, know that this is more of a jazz album than an electronic music album, and more of a soul album than either. And it's on the third track, ""Fleer Ultra"", that Bruner's true loves finally leaps to the fore, because that's the first time the bass really goes bananas. Bruner is undoubtedly what was once called a ""musician's musician,"" a practice-space hound who reveres good playing. He's unashamed of his talent, but he also knows it's better put to use making hooks. And throughout Apocalypse it's Bruner’s exceptionally fluid bass work that ties together the new millennium computer madness and the cuts that feel like they could have been laid down in the analog days of 1974. Even the drowsiest songs here pop with super-animated basslines. His already justly lauded cover of George Duke’s ""For Love I Come"" turns the tempo of the original down a few notches, letting most the of song play out as an amorphous but silky swirl of electric keyboard and his echo-warped voice-- he makes sure to bring out those bass chops for the climax. As a singer, Bruner is much better than he has to be, considering his musical inventiveness is already plenty attention-grabbing, but while his fluttery, heartsick vocals lend Apocalypse much of its charm and memorability, it's those basslines that are the real earworms. So this isn't really a song album, at least not in the sense that it’ll give rock or even R&B fans looking for verse-chorus-verse much to chew on. As with FlyLo, it's still best to approach Apocalypse as instrumental head-trip, albeit one that's occasionally got tunes you can hum. But like his fusion heroes, Bruner wants it all: the future shock of electronics, the tightly edited pleasures of pop, the love-sick opulence of quiet-storm soul, and the show-stopper instrumental breaks of jazz. The fact that he's mostly pulled it off, with a record that's serious in intent while playful in execution, is pretty astounding.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15758-the-golden-age-of-apocalypse/,Brainfeeder,2011.0
231,Lil Wayne,Tha Carter IV,Rap,6.2,August 30 2011,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"A lot of rappers show a lot of love for Lil Wayne on his new album. ""Thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with Tha Carter IV,"" huffs Busta Rhymes. ""It's important that you are more than welcome to Tha Carter IV, and y'all enjoy it,"" advises André 3000. ""Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss,"" reiterates Wayne's fellow ex-con Shyne. And it's Drake who provides the record's most impassioned verse about his mentor's 2010 prison stint for criminal gun possession: ""Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol/ But at least they had some bad bitches workin' in that shit hole."" The man born Dwayne Carter never needed to be propped up like this before. During his Untouchable Era-- from the December 2005 release of Tha Carter II through 2008's Tha Carter III, with several classic mixtapes in between-- Wayne was The Best Rapper Alive because he said he was, and then rhymed his brain off to prove it. He doesn't claim that world-beating title once on Tha Carter IV. And no one else claims it for him. We accepted last year's duo of disappointments-- the aggravated rock turn Rebirth and the unfocused stop-gap collection I Am Not a Human Being-- because they were mere anomalies or appetizers. This summer's Sorry 4 the Wait mixtape was passable, but slight compared to previous off-label bounties like Dedication 2, Da Drought 3, or No Ceilings. So while there hasn't been much recorded evidence to support Wayne's hip-hop supremacy over the last three years, Tha Carter IV was always going to be the true test. As such, it's the rapper's most unfulfilling and worrisome move in a long while. Almost everything about Wayne is relaxed, regurgitated, or regressing here. Most noticeable is his slowed-down flow, perhaps a capitulation to the booming arenas he now plays to regularly, where intelligibility often trumps quick wit. But whereas the only permanent aspect of Wayne's cadence used to be its shiftiness, his delivery has slackened, severely deadening his ferociousness in the process. The falloff is made more apparent by a couple of guest shots from two of rap's most exuberant fast talkers, Busta Rhymes and Kansas City cult hero Tech N9ne. It's as if Wayne dispatched the pair to provide the dexterity he won't (or can't) come up with himself anymore. On ""Interlude"", Tech N9ne and an oddly uncredited André 3000 reel off two of the album's best verses, perfectly setting up its star for a clean-up finale. But Wayne never shows on that track, or the star-studded ""Outro"", as if he'd rather play curator than be the focus of some of the highlights on his own album. His trepidation is understandable considering how Drake and Rick Ross easily overshadow him on recent singles ""She Will"" and ""John"", respectively. In fact, one of Wayne's more spirited moments on the album comes when he forgoes a third verse on ""She Will"" and just hollers and mugs behind Drake's hook instead; he just sounds excited to be in the background. After an epic run, it seems as though Wayne has finally run out of inventive ways to say he's on drugs, or great at sex, or extremely interested in making money. Because after you've been ""so motherfuckin' high, I can eat a star,"" as he claimed on Da Drought 3, being ""so high, I get star-struck"" just doesn't pack the same oomph. Elsewhere, he's found a new love for the type of faux-profundity he rarely had time or patience for before. ""I'm searching for today, instead I found tomorrow/ And I put that shit right back like, 'I'll see what I find tomorrow,'"" he blankly philosophizes on ""Nightmares of the Bottom"", itself a downgrade of Tha Carter III's brilliantly soulful ""Let the Beat Build"". Once joyously freewheeling, Tha Carter series has gotten to the point where it comes with its own hip-hop tropes and rules: a combination of East Coast lyricism, West Coast violence, and a distinctly Southern rhythm and flair. That singular formula has served Wayne well in the past, but some of this album's most enjoyable moments do away with it altogether. The squelching T-Pain duet ""How to Hate"" is a paradoxically gorgeous kiss-off that finds the pair heart-worn and a bit pissed. ""She used to always say, fuck my niggas/ And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas, well..."" laments Wayne in a coaxing purr. As usual, T-Pain plays a permanent resident of the friend zone, while Wayne lashes out in the most charming way possible; the track makes you wish the rumored T-Wayne project would actually get off the ground. Even softer is that song's R&B rejoinder, ""How to Love"", Wayne's most mature song to date. And while it's a little jarring to hear the guy behind ""Lollipop"" and so many Gremlins references attempt a legitimate grown-up ballad, the 28 year old's tough love feels earned. Without a fierce beat or screaming guitars backing him, Wayne's sing-rap croak is caught out there on the track, and it results in one of the few Carter IV performances that doesn't sound like a canned retread. Recently, Lil Wayne spoke out on the topic of retirement. ""I want to become a better father and a better man to my woman, and those things take time,"" he told MTV. ""And time takes away from [music]. So the honest answer to that [retirement] question is, I don't know. Maybe so."" Even back in his hallowed heyday, on Dedication 2, he had retirement on his mind. ""My career is my life, so I could never retire out, even when I stop rapping,"" he said in an interlude. ""Hopefully, I'm known for something different-- not different, but known for something else, also."" It's a nice thought. And, after all, this album's uncharacteristic R&B anomalies stand out most. While Tha Carter IV isn't the first indication that Wayne's finest verses are behind him, it is the most glaring. Still, he seems smart enough to know that for every Jay-Z there are scores of rappers-- including several guests on this very album-- trying to relive past glories on a daily basis. Wayne has floated the notion that Tha Carter IV could be his last album. The threat makes sense.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15770-tha-carter-iv/,"Cash Money,Universal Motown,Young Money Entertainment",2011.0
232,Marvin Gaye,What's Going On [40th Anniversary Edition],Pop/R&B,9.5,July 28 2011,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"Marvin Gaye submitted a version of the most important single of his career, ""What's Going On"", to Motown Records in the summer of 1970. Over the previous seven years, the relationship between the singer and his label was contentious yet fruitful; gritty uptempo songs like ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"" and ""Hitch Hike"" were hits, but they undermined Gaye's dream to be a balladeer in the mold of Nat King Cole. Those lusty trifles also roused the internal conflict between the artist's gospel upbringing and his endless desire for carnal pleasure. And while Gaye aspired to be more than just a singer within Motown's assembly-line chug, his boss, brother-in-law, and fellow hard-headed egoist Berry Gordy Jr. wasn't so crazy about the idea. So when Gordy heard that original ""What's Going On"" mix-- which is included in this box set for the first time-- he rejected the song, reportedly calling it ""the worst thing I've ever heard in my life."" Instead of releasing ""What's Going On"" that fall, Motown put out the Gaye compilation Super Hits, which depicts its clean-shaven star as a cartoon superhero flying through the air and fixing a radio tower as a buxom damsel perilously hangs from his shoulder. But Gaye wanted nothing more than to blow up that gleaming image of himself-- now in his early 30s, he would accept nothing but complete control over his art. And if Motown wasn't going to release his first self-produced song, he wasn't going to make music for Motown. Gaye sat idle for months until his label, desperate to put out something-- anything-- from its biggest solo star, finally eked the single out under Gordy's nose on January 21, 1971. It was an instant success, hitting No. 2 on the pop charts and, perhaps more importantly for Gaye, giving him a win in his constant battle with Gordy, who couldn't deny a smash. Five months later, Marvin Gaye released his full-grown symphony to God, What's Going On, with little resistance. Forty years of ubiquity have made the title track commonplace, so it's easy to forget that the song was the ""most avant-garde hit Motown ever had,"" according to Ben Edmonds' thorough album history What's Going On: Marvin Gaye and the Last Days of the Motown Sound. With this album, Gaye wished to sidestep the sound that made him and others famous during Motown's untouchable 60s run, trading in that trademark big, bright beat for laid-back grooves inspired by Duke Ellington, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, and Santana. And not only was the album a coming-out party for Gaye as a producer and songwriter, he found his signature voice-- soft, floating, airy-- on What's Going On, too. ""I felt like I'd finally learned to sing,"" he told biographer David Ritz. ""I'd been studying the microphone for a dozen years, and I suddenly saw what I'd been doing wrong. I'd been singing too loud."" The record and its creative revelations led to his stunning 70s auteur period, which birthed three more classics: 1973's Let's Get It On, 1976's I Want You, and 1978's Here, My Dear. Yet What's Going On still stands tallest, making this 40th anniversary, 2CD/LP edition more of a welcome reminder than just another eulogy to baby-boomer culture. Much has been made of What's Going On's political bent, and it's true that the music was partially inspired by Marvin's brother Frankie, who had come back from a three-year tour of Vietnam, along with troublingly violent episodes like the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Kent State shootings that saw four students killed by national guardsmen. Songs like peace-espousing title track and ""What's Happening Brother"", which finds Gaye expressing a war veteran's helplessness upon returning home, show Marvin's dismay toward his country and government. But this album isn't just a protest time capsule. Far from it. Gaye's disappointment isn't just societal, it's personal as well. During this period, the singer had lost his duet partner and dear friend, Tammi Terrell, and his marriage to Gordy's sister Anna was violently breaking down, and he was being tailed by the IRS for unpaid back taxes. His resulting depression is evident throughout; What's Going On isn't a fiery album filled with timely sloganeering. Part of its long-lasting appeal involves an element of true-to-life resignation. ""Who's willing to try to save a world/ That's destined to die,"" he sings on ""Save the Children"", pinpointing an American melancholia-- a mix of world-saving power and funereal inevitability-- that endures today. But the album doesn't wallow, either. It hums and glides on the effortless, multi-tracked Marvins that swoop through the stereo spectrum like ghosts. Gaye's signature vocal ad libs started here and have endured through R&B and hip-hop ever since. His marijuana-soaked delivery, along with the album's mutating, percussion-fueled rhythms, majestic strings, and jazzy horns, give the affair levity. Perhaps this smooth front also has to do with the fact that Gaye was ""hardly an activist in the traditional sense,"" according to Edmonds. While his Vietnam-battered brother was an emotional catalyst, Gaye had neglected to send him one letter during his army stint. And though he was certainly aware of the Detroit race riot that left 43 people dead in 1967, he viewed the sad display on TV from his cushy home on the outskirts of town. Not to say Gaye didn't wholeheartedly believe in the progressive observations found on What's Going On, butÂ his relative distance from his subjects allows him to fly over top of them, providing a healing pulse to the disarray below. For an album as timeless as this one, reissue bonus material can provide worthy footnotes to the main article. Probably thanks to the last decade's vinyl resurgence, this 40th anniversary edition immediately sets itself apart from 2001's 30th anniversary release by presenting its iconic cover in a glorious 12""x12"" square. The package's lone LP features the more straightforward, early Detroit mix of the album, while the final, L.A. mix is relegated to a CD. For die-hards, the most alluring part of the package may be the second compact disc, which features 18 mostly instrumental demos recorded in Gaye's post-What's Going On honeymoon period, when his vast artistic ambitions and abilities were being embraced by the greater public. These somewhat experimental demos-- deep, in-the-pocket funk in the vein of Sly Stone, George Clinton, and Jimi Hendrix-- clearly laid the groundwork for much of his subsequent 70s material. Though he doesn't sing on most of these tracks, it's exciting to hear him get loose as keyboardist and band leader. Just as What's Going On marked the emergence of Marvin Gaye as an all-in-one talent, it also signaled the decline of Motown's reign. It's tempting to simply side with Gaye in his battles with the label that raised him and play into the auteur myth. But it's more complicated than that. Without his tutelage at Motown, first as a session player then as a singer, Gaye wouldn't have been able to conceive a work like this. The help of Motown backing band the Funk Brothers-- credited in the What's Going On liner notes after years of anonymity-- was also essential. Before he was shot and killed by his own father at age 44 in 1984, Gaye was afforded the schooling of America's finest pop academy and then the freedom to flourish and act on his own whims afterward. His 70s brilliance is unfathomable without his 60s pop triumphs. And What's Going On is the turning point, the moment when he was able to bypass his selfishness and self-destructiveness in the name of God, peace, love. It's a nice dream. One that he knew was too good to last. ""Mercy, mercy me,"" he pleaded calmly, desperately.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15679-whats-going-on-40th-anniversary-edition/,"Interscope,Motown,Interscope,Motown",1971.0
233,Lil Wayne,Sorry 4 the Wait,Rap,7.1,July 27 2011,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Lil Wayne spends so much of Sorry 4 the Wait, his new mixtape, rapping about guns and drugs and sex that it's easy to miss one telling little lyrical detail. Rapping over Rick Ross associate Gunplay's riotous bass-bomb ""Rollin'"", Wayne says, ""I cut down on the syrup/ Now I'm in better shape."" That qualifies as a big admission for Wayne. Back when he was on his historic mid-2000s mixtape rampage, Wayne's constant consumption of codeine cough syrup, a drug that has contributed to the death of more than a couple of Southern rap legends, was a genuine cause for concern. But Wayne's on parole now after serving eight months in Rikers Island. He has a whole lot of consequences in store if he gets caught with drugs anytime soon. Wayne's bottomless appetites once informed both his public persona and his firing-in-every-direction, mad-genius rap style. But on Sorry 4 the Wait, he sounds at least somewhat reserved and controlled; that sense that he could fly off into pure gibberish at any moment is gone. Unlike Dedication 2 or Da Drought 3, Sorry 4 the Wait sounds like the work of a mortal human being. Happily, that mortal human being still happens to be very good at rapping. Wayne's actually having an excellent 2011. On Sorry 4 the Wait, he revives his old mixtape trick of rapping over a bunch of the songs currently tearing up rap radio. It feels a bit incomplete, though, since so many of those songs-- the ones conspicuously absent from the tape-- already feature Lil Wayne rapping on them: Chris Brown's ""Look at Me Now"", DJ Khaled's ""I'm on One"", Ace Hood's ""Hustle Hard Remix"", Wayne's own ""6 Foot 7 Foot"" and ""John"". On those tracks, Wayne sounds like a man possessed, completely missing the rust and out-of-time lostness that affects so many rappers just out of prison. (Wayne's time in prison was short, and it ended several months ago, which almost certainly has something to do with his relative freshness. Still, it's notable and impressive.) Relative to those tracks, he sounds subdued and uncommitted through most of Sorry 4 the Wait. The title itself speaks to a certain just-fucking-around modesty; it's just a quick-and-dirty collection thrown out into the world to atone for all the delays in Tha Carter IV's release date. Compare that to his last mixtape, No Ceilings, its title itself an act of sky's-the-limit bravado. Even when Wayne dropped No Ceilings nearly two years ago, it seemed weirdly lazy and passe for an A-list rapper to drop a mix of freestyles and nothing else; after all, guys like Gucci Mane crank out entire tapes of fully realized songs at frightening speeds. But if Sorry 4 the Wait is a throwaway, it's an awfully fun one. Occasionally, Wayne will come up with an extended piece of casual, free-associative lyrical inventiveness, like this one, from his version of Miguel's ""Sure Thing"": ""Lord knows I'm a sinner/ Pain pills for dinner/ Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer/ Got a chopper and a trimmer/ Shooting like Jimmer/ You're coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer."" More often, though, he's letting off silly Drake-style hashtag-rap punchlines and sticking with blunt-but-effective Rick Ross rhyme patterns. And yet it mostly works, because it's just a blast to hear him having fun for 41 minutes straight instead. He can get overwhelmingly self-aggrandizing: ""My girl pussy feel like heaven to a god."" He can get goofily puerile, using Drake's gorgeously conflicted sensitive synth-rap confession ""Marvin's Room"" to bust off some irreverently nasty sex talk: ""She take it every way except personal."" He indulges in plenty of singsong cadence, but all of it sounds like rapping, and none of it comes with the Auto-Tune he kept using for too long. When Lil B, a stylistic descendant in many ways, shows up on a freestyle of Waka Flocka Flame's ""Grove St. Party"", Wayne sounds comparatively focused-- and ""focused"" isn't a word I would've used to describe Wayne at any point over the last couple of years. Even on autopilot, as he often is here, Wayne sounds like a man reawakened and re-energized. The most-fun part of the mixtape doesn't really have anything to do with rapping at all. The final track is a six-minute non-rapping rant over the clipped, fired-up dancehall of Beyoncé's ""Run the World (Girls)"" (itself a flip of Major Lazer's ""Pon De Floor""). Wayne's track is a sort of extended multi-tracked ad-lib, with a whole mob of Waynes yelling incoherently throughout. One of those Waynes yells about all the things going right with his life right now: ""I am happy! I'm in love! I'm in love! I picked up a new hobby! I make way too much money! My kids are growing up healthy and beautiful and intelligent! My mom's getting married! Congratulations!"" Another Wayne shouts out an endless parade of random people. Still another indulges in some pure non-sequitur ridiculousness: ""Rest in peace John F. Kennedy! Rest in peace Marilyn Monroe!"" The tape is an encouraging indication that even a cleaned-up Wayne has plenty of insanity left in him. And I, for one, hope that insanity is all over Tha Carter IV.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15663-sorry-4-the-wait/,,2011.0
234,Kendrick Lamar,Section.80,Rap,8.0,July 21 2011,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Kendrick Lamar is a weird kid, and rap music could always use more weird kids. The 24-year-old is a Compton native with a budding and mysterious Dr. Dre connection, but there's little-to-no link to his hometown's gangsta-funk legacy in his music. Instead, Lamar is very much a product of the late blog-rap era-- an introverted loner type who's willing to talk tough but is more interested in taking a Mag-Lite to his own personal failings and what he sees as the flaws of his generation. His rap style is fluid and melodic but approachable, and his frantic tumble of syllables evokes the feeling when you're high enough that your thoughts arrive fast and interrupt each other. If one of the Bone Thugs guys had a dorky, overly sincere younger cousin who was really into Afrobeat and Terrence Malick movies, it'd be Kendrick. Lamar does exist within a strong West Coast continuum, but it has nothing to do with Dre. Instead, he's very much within the tradition of 90s groups like Souls of Mischief or the Pharcyde-- self-deprecating and insanely talented kids who routinely ripped dizzy, slip-sliding flows over mellow jazz breaks. Section.80, Lamar's new album, arrives on a wave of blog-based buzz, but beyond a couple of ill-advised choruses, it doesn't make much attempt to present Lamar to major-label A&Rs or to a wider audience. Instead, it gives him a chance to chase his muse wherever it runs. The production, mostly from relative unknowns like THC and Sounwave, is almost uniformly excellent-- a spaced-out blur of astral horns and blissed-out Fender Rhodes, with drums that only knock when they need to. A couple of guys from Lamar's Black Hippy crew-- those guys really sound like Souls of Mischief when they get together-- show up, but the album isn't a guest-heavy affair. It's a young thinker attempting to describe the world as he sees it. ""You know why we crack babies cuz we born in the 80s,"" Lamar raps on the excellently emo relationship-song ""A.D.H.D."", and that's a theme that comes up over and over. Everywhere he looks, Lamar sees generational symptoms of the kids who came from the era of crack and Ronald Reagan. When he looks around, Lamar sees self-hate, nihilism, institutionalized oppression. When he talks to girls, he sometimes recalls the supportively sincere Goodie Mob of ""Beautiful Skin"", actually counseling against cosmetics on ""No Make-Up (Her Vice)"": ""Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?/ From heaven is where you got it from."" (Somehow, the redundant double-""from"" makes the sentiment all the more adorable.) And he also recognizes self-destructive tendencies in himself: ""I used to wanna see the penitentiary way after elementary/ Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me."" But it's not like he's some preacher/prophet figure; he says ""suck my dick"" often enough that it gets boring. Given that Lamar is a talented and earnest young man with a lot to say and no big label nudging his music toward accessibility, it's only natural that he'd lose his way every once in a while. Section.80 is an hour long, and it could drop probably a quarter of its running time without anyone missing anything. And certain moments just make me wince so hard, like this one, from ""Hol' Up"": ""I wrote this record while 30,000 feet in the air/ Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair/ If I could fuck her in front of all these passengers/ They'd probably think I'm a terrorist."" Those few lines add up to a repellent cauldron of horniness, persecution-complex fantasies, exhibitionism, and plain old youthful Bad Idea Jeans indulgence. Dre hasn't yet taught Lamar how to hone all his best ideas into a few absolutely killer pieces of music; maybe he still will. But self-serious flaws and all, Section.80 still stands as a powerful document of a tremendously promising young guy figuring out his voice. Its best moments (""Rigamortis"", ""HiiiPower"", ""Kush & Corinthians"", ""A.D.H.D."") are simply dope as fuck, no qualifiers necessary.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/,Top Dawg,2011.0
235,Beyoncé,4,Pop/R&B,8.0,June 28 2011,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"One of the year's best music videos was directed by Jay-Z and cost about zero dollars to make. The camera phone clip shows Beyoncé rehearsing her new album's opening eternal-love ballad, ""1+1"", backstage at ""American Idol"". There she is: eyes shut, standing in front of a mirror, singing her guts out while family and friends look on in quiet awe. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's ""Take Away Show"", its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. ""Help me let down my guard,"" she belts. And, as Beyoncé finishes the song, you hear her proud husband let out a joyous ""woo!"" It's all quite endearing and personal-- two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple. ""Sometimes you need perspective,"" wrote Jay in an intro to the video on his Life + Times website. ""You've been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time."" It's a fitting sentiment and song to introduce 4, which largely deals with monogamy and all that comes with committing to one person for a potential lifetime. Which, like a bad marriage, might sound boring, repetitive, staid. But, in Beyoncé's more-than-capable and still-in-love hands, a relationship that lasts can seem as complicated and rewarding as anyone would hope. ""If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn/ 'Cause I got it with you,"" she testifies on ""1+1""-- potentially dubious words from a woman who certainly has ""something,"" but her mainlined vocals quickly dismiss mere logistics. The song boasts some of her finest-ever singing laid over a bed of warm and flowing synths, strings, and bass that manages to connect the dots between Sam Cooke and Prince without sacrificing any Beyoncé-ness. ""1+1"" is that rare wonder: a wedding song that pleases but doesn't pander. The only recent pop ballad that comes close to its power is Adele's stunning ""Someone Like You"". But where that song-- and its massively successful corresponding album, 21-- wrung out the aftermath of young heartbreak, Beyoncé is aiming for something a bit more challenging with 4: love the one you're with, and have some fun doing it, too. The album's relative riskiness extends to its music, which side-steps Top 40 radio's current Eurobeat fixation for a refreshingly eclectic mix of early-90s R&B, 80s lite soul, and brass'n'percussion-heavy marching music. All of the album's best elements, thematically and sonically, burst ahead on Jay-Z ode ""Countdown"", a honking, stutter-step sequel of sorts to ""Crazy in Love"". The new track makes 10 years of loyalty seem just as thrilling as the first time, with Beyoncé offering her partner copious praise in that famed half-rap cadence: ""Still love the way he talks/ Still love the way I sing/ Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain."" The album's carefree retro sensibility pops up on three more highlights, including the Kanye West-assisted ""Party"", which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, bubbly 80s keyboard tones, and 90s girl-group harmonies. The track has Beyoncé infatuated once again while its mid-tempo bounce provides prime summer barbecue background. ""Love on Top"" lilts like a lost Reagan-era smash, its light-as-air bop recalling Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Stevie Wonder at their sunniest. And ""End of Time"" is perhaps 4's most strident declaration of co-dependence; sounding like En Vogue remixed by a high school pep band, the song has Beyoncé finding the strength in two as she sings, ""I just wanna be with you/ I just wanna live for you/ I'd never let you go!"" That track-- along with most of 4's stand outs-- was co-written and co-produced by the star's other invaluable partner, Terius ""The-Dream"" Nash. The pair first combined forces on super hit ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"", but their collaborative relationship fully blooms on this album's ramped-up back half, including the bombastic, Major Lazer-sampling empowerment tract ""Run the World (Girls)"". As a songwriter, The-Dream has a way of drawing out a side of Beyoncé that's both more personal and brash, and, as seen on his several brilliant solo albums, his production style routinely references past greats while standing in the now. Tellingly, without his help the album stumbles, as on the overblown ""I Was Here"", a faceless, theoretically-inspirational slog written by veteran schlockmeister Diane Warren. (Unsurprisingly, ""I Was Here"" is the only cut on the record that wasn't co-written by Beyoncé herself, too.) Elsewhere, Babyface spearheads the decent ""Irreplaceable"" retread ""Best Thing I Never Had"", which probably wouldn't sound out-of-place on a Vanessa Carlton album, and Sleepy Jackson/Empire of the Sun leader Luke Steele worked on the ungainly ""Rather Die Young"", which ruins its Philly soul vibe with a theatrical Broadway glaze. (Steele also contributed an awful hook on Jay-Z's Blueprint 3 trash-can bait ""What We Talkin' About""-- can we get him away from this couple, please?) Ironically, 4's deluxe edition comes with three bonus songs that would easily count among the proper album's finest moments. Chiefly, The-Dream co-written/produced ""Schoolin' Life"" is an irresistible Prince tribute that's much more motivational than ""I Was Here"" could ever be: ""Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?"" struts Beyoncé. The singer has said she recorded more than 60 songs while making 4, and some of the wrong-headed inclusions are lazy attempts at re-creating her past hits. But they are few. And the lion's share of the album-- along with its excellent deluxe tracks-- has one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted, which is always exciting. After 2008's I Am... Sasha Fierce, which saw Beyoncé catching up to trends when she wasn't trying Streisand-wannabe ballads, 4 is more akin to her wily sophomore solo album, B'Day. But where that record was preoccupied with the club, 4 is happy at home; on Off the Wall-style bonus track ""Lay Up Under Me"", the contented 29-year-old gushes, ""You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club, just come on lay up under me tonight."" If anyone can make a quiet Friday night come off like an open-bar blowout, it's Beyoncé.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/,Columbia,2011.0
236,Bon Iver,"Bon Iver, Bon Iver",Rock,9.5,June 20 2011,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"The guy who recorded an album alone in the woods. This line might end up on Justin Vernon's tombstone. There's something irresistible about the thought of a bearded dude from small-town Wisconsin retreating, heartbroken, to a cabin to write some songs-- especially when the result is a record that sounds as hushed and introspective as Bon Iver's 2007 debut, For Emma, Forever Ago. These days, Vernon is more likely to poke fun at the image, but it endures because it fulfils a fantasy for us as listeners. Even if we don't care for the outdoors, most of us occasionally want to escape our lives, be alone with our thoughts, and see if we can tap into something true. In a time of easy distraction, the idea of heading into a cabin at the edge of the world to create is alluring. By tying the intimacy of that image to Justin Vernon's music, we're able to take the trip with him. Since that album's release, Vernon's approach to writing and recording has changed. ""I don't find inspiration by just sitting down with a guitar anymore,"" he recently told Pitchfork. ""I wanted to build a sound from scratch and then use that sound to make the song."" That difference is clear on Bon Iver. Instead of something that scans as ""folk,"" the music here is more like rustic chamber pop with an experimental edge that makes careful use of arrangement and dynamics. And rather than being tied together by a central theme of loss, Vernon has fully shifted into a more impressionistic mode; these songs are broader and more musically sophisticated than those on For Emma at every turn. But the thread between this album and its comparatively skeletal predecessor is Vernon's voice, an instrument that feels warm and personal and close regardless of setting. Now that we've heard him singing hooks with Kanye West and taking the lead with Gayngs on songs that touch on R&B and soft rock, the general sphere of Vernon's voice is clear. He simultaneously evokes the grain and expression of soul music along with the mythological echoes of folk. But more importantly, no one else sounds like him. The Beach Boys have been the primary touchstone for layered vocals in indie music for years, but Vernon's timbre comes from somewhere else entirely. Where ""Beach Boys harmonies"" have a spiritual undercurrent that brings to mind a choirboy's dream of perfection, Vernon sounds like a man who has outgrown such ideas. His voice is earthy and wounded and, despite his astonishing upper register, not something you would describe as ""angelic."" ""Holocene"" contains one of this album's many virtuosic vocal performances. ""Part of me, apart from me,"" Vernon sings early on, and those six words hold a lot. The evocative nature of his diction is apparent even in a simple line like ""I was not magnificent."" He sounds centered and clear while taking stock and allowing memories to be mixed in with the details of the present. His conflicted vocals trigger a half-dozen feelings all at once before releasing the tension with a refrain that finds the fleeting moment where the world seems right: ""I could see for miles, miles, miles."" Vernon posted Bon Iver's lyrics shortly after the album leaked last month, but they're not easy to parse-- the storytelling here is oblique. But there are connections. The song titles reference actual places (""Calgary"") and places that sound real, but aren't (""Hinnom, TX"", ""Michicant""); they're less about geography and more about putting a name to a state of mind that mixes clarity and surrealism. And the deeper you sink into these tracks, the harder it becomes to extract specifics. One recurring element is intoxication-- lines about being drunk or high that come with recounted details. Which makes sense, because the album deals with escape and the struggle to get outside yourself. The narrator takes in what's around him, mixing those thoughts with memories of where he's been. Sometimes the lines have a startling specificity (""Third and Lake it burnt away, the hallway/ Was where we learned to celebrate,"" on ""Holocene"") and sometimes they contain words that seem to function more as sound (""fide"" or ""fane"" on ""Perth""). Throughout, there's a strong sense of an observer taking things in and processing confusing images, trying to figure out what can be learned. If you caught Vernon live after For Emma, you gradually saw him putting more and more emphasis on his band, moving Bon Iver from that solitary project into something that felt more like the work of a group. And Bon Iver, with its rich and layered arrangements, extends that development in a striking direction that's both logical and surprising. Blending natural instrumentation supplied by recruited players-- such as string arranger Rob Moose (Antony and the Johnsons, the National, Arcade Fire) and a horn/woodwind section that includes versatile saxophonist Colin Stetson-- with an array of electronic and treated sounds, the album combines varied textures in ways that are ambitious and unusual but often subtle enough to miss on first glance. At points, Bon Iver draws on the experiments of Volcano Choir, Vernon's side project with the post-rock outfit Collections of Colonies of Bees (members from that group play on the album). Freed from conventional verse/chorus/bridge/chorus structure, the songs become more like tone poems, patient explorations of moods that proceed deliberately but unpredictably. The holistic style is evident on opener ""Perth"", which builds from total silence into a crashing peak over the course of four short minutes. And there's an uncanny moment on the breathtaking ""Michicant"", a song in part about childhood, where a bicycle bell rings twice, pulling you deeper into Vernon's reverie. It's a simple, brief effect, but it's indicative of how the album uses elemental sounds in unexpected ways. Vernon has taken that voice, and these arrangements, and crafted an album that unfolds like a suite. The structure is flawless right up to its conclusion, ""Beth/Rest"", which has been much remarked upon for its unabashed and unironic embrace of 80s adult contemporary pop sounds. If you've spent any time in the vicinity of a radio tuned to light rock, you hear the keyboard tone that opens the song and you think Lionel Richie, Richard Marx, and ""No One Is to Blame"". It's almost naive of Vernon to think he could pull this off. Yet, heard in context, it stands as one the record's bravest and most deftly executed moments-- not just because it lays bare Vernon's stated admiration for artists like Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Hornsby, but because it's executed to perfection. And while the production attempts to wring something new from a long-maligned sound, the song and voice remain true to Bon Iver as an idea. As a closer, ""Beth/Rest"" is more about finding comfort and resolution after a musical experience that asked more questions than it answered. The song draws a line in the sand for anyone with a deep investment in cool, and Vernon stands behind it with confidence. His belief in himself and in the power of his music is something that encourages us to transcend labels and preconceptions. After the closeness and austerity of For Emma, Vernon has given us a knotty record that resists easy interpretation but is no less warm or welcoming. You can feel it even as you don't completely understand it-- a testament to its careful construction and Vernon's belief in the power of music to convey deeper meaning. It's a rare thing for an album to have such a strong sense of what it wants to be. Bon Iver is about flow, from one scene and arrangement and song and memory and word into the next-- each distinct but connected-- all leading to ""Beth/Rest"". On the way there, the music moves like a river, every bend both unpredictable and inevitable as it carves sound and emotion out of silence.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/,Jagjaguwar/4AD,2011.0
237,Depeche Mode,Remixes 2: 81-11,"Electronic,Rock",4.3,June 8 2011,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"A few seconds into Tigerskin's remix of ""In Chains"", a pro forma Martin Gore song from 2009's Sounds of the Universe, there's a startling sound-- a little two-note metallic clank, off-pitch but ear-grabbing in a way the rest of the track (and most of the album) isn't. It's the opening noise of Depeche Mode's 1984 single ""People Are People"", or something a lot like it, and it's a reminder that the band used to be about sound as much as mood and tune and personality. The first decade's worth of Depeche Mode songs were eminently remixable, because they almost all had sonic signatures: You could put together a terrific version of anything on, say, Some Great Reward without even using their melodies or vocals. ""Personal Jesus"", from 1989, got over on its glam beat and a sneering electric guitar that the band treated like the coolest new gizmo they'd ever encountered. But for the past 20 years-- and especially since Alan Wilder left in 1995-- their arrangements sound more like the work of a generic band-that-uses-electronics, and most of the remixers here don't replace them with anything particularly distinctive either. As its title suggests, the 3xCD Remixes 2-- also available in a condensed single-disc edition-- is a sequel to another brick of a set, 2004's Remixes 81-04. That collection consisted mostly of fondly remembered mixes that had appeared on Depeche Mode's 12"" singles over the years, with a few newly commissioned reworkings of old favorites. Since then, they've released two awful-ish studio albums, whose single remixes are drawn on heavily here, along with a bit of barrel-scraping for passable older stuff, like Gareth Jones' 1985 remix of ""Fly on the Windscreen"", and another smattering of new interpretations. There are some big names here: UNKLE, M83, Trentemøller, Dan the Automator (who sadly doesn't take on ""John the Revelator""). Few of them are doing anywhere near their best work, because they generally don't have much to work with. There's some good stuff here anyway, probably a really solid EP's worth. Röyksopp's ""Puppets"" reaches all the way back to a 1981 album track-- it's effectively a half-rewritten cover of the song rather than a remix proper, but they sound like they're having a blast. It's fun to hear the two ex-members of Depeche Mode each remixing a song written after his departure-- Vince Clarke does ""Behind the Wheel"" and Alan Wilder does another version of ""In Chains"". Digitalism's take on ""Never Let Me Down Again"" takes advantage of its one-note melody to build up a head of scalding digital distortion. And of the three mixes of ""Personal Jesus"" here, one is pretty good. (That would be the one by Stargate, who are big enough Depeche Mode fans that they snuck a musical quote from ""Master and Servant"" into Rihanna's ""S&M"". Their version is also one of only three tracks on these three discs to come in under the four-minute mark.) Mostly, though, this is a depressing reminder of the distance between what Depeche Mode once were and what they've become.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15511-remixes-2-81-11/,Mute,2011.0
238,My Morning Jacket,Circuital,Rock,7.2,May 31 2011,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"My Morning Jacket have always been something of a mythic outfit. Back in 1999, when the band released its debut LP, The Tennessee Fire (and again in 2001, after the release of At Dawn), its legend was whispered quietly, like a ghost story: Kentucky, grain silos, reverb, that high, liquid voice. As 2001 was the apex of a certain kind of dark, New York City cool-- with the Strokes and Interpol slouching around the Lower East Side in threadbare t-shirts and tiny ties-- My Morning Jacket were steeped in a warm, eerie other-ness that culminated, cathartically, with Jim James howling ""All your life/ Is obscene."" Well, sure. In the ensuing decade, the band became legendary for its heroic live show (in 2008, they stormed through a near-four-hour set at Bonnaroo), but its studio work has always been a little less triumphant. On record, My Morning Jacket can sometimes sound like a band struggling against its own best interests, purposefully eschewing the exact thing-- huge, ghostly, terrifying rock'n'roll-- it does so disarmingly well. Accordingly, the reigning press narrative surrounding Circuital, MMJ's sixth LP, has been focused on the band's supposed ""return to form,"" a response that feels like a direct reaction to its title (or, more likely, to 2008's falsetto-addled Evil Urges, easily the band's most divisive record). But what are they returning to, exactly? My Morning Jacket’s early discography is rooted in oddball experimentation: Despite the open-mouthed riffing, impenetrable reverb, and whipping hair, they’ve never really been a straightforward rock band, especially on record. Jim James' penchant for psychedelic soul is constantly manifesting in new ways, and while Circuital is closer, certainly, to 2005's Z than Evil Urges, it doesn’t feel like a step backwards, or even like a lateral hop. The record opens with James tooting a half-serious introductory ""horn"" riff that belies a goofy sense of humor. James has always been something of a jokester (cue the whispered ""Shaaa!"" at the end of ""Circuital"" or the line, ""They told me not to smoke drugs, but I wouldn't listen/ Never thought I'd get caught and wind up in prison,"" from ""Outta My System""), but his voice is so naturally dramatic that even silly bits can sound like earnest proclamations. That's why-- and this is unique to MMJ-- he often sounds best when he's delivering vague platitudes. Still, anyone who's ever heard James wail in concert is likely to be frustrated by the eternal underuse of his voice in the studio, even when the songs were ostensibly recorded live. There are a few tracks here where producer Tucker Martine captures it in all its intoxicating splendor-- the acoustic lament ""Wonderful (The Way I Feel)"" especially-- but most only hint at what James is capable of delivering in person. His falsetto (contentious since the days of ""Highly Suspicious"") comes back for ""Holdin on to Black Metal"", a bizarre bit of jam-funk that alternates between pleasantly spirited and genuinely stupid (it's a cautionary tale about not growing out of black metal fandom, and ends with a shout of ""Let's rock!""). On ""Slow Slow Tune"", James sounds remarkably vulnerable, singing to his future progeny over a barely there, bubblegum guitar figure that recalls the Everly Brothers before transitioning into a Flaming Lips-style burnout. Like nearly all of their studio albums, Circuital may not reach the heights of the band's live show-- a good MMJ concert can recalibrate your gut, it can change you-- but it’s a remarkably solid step for a band that's never stopped evolving.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15471-circuital/,ATO,2011.0
239,"Tyler, the Creator",Goblin,Rap,8.0,May 11 2011,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"A year ago, very few people knew Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All. The nihilistic, mostly-teenaged L.A. rap collective has been releasing free mixtapes since 2008, but until recently, they were ignored by most of the rap blogosphere. Full of pathos, humor, and hatred, the group has worked tirelessly to establish their own intricate world online-- from their YouTube account, filled with self-produced videos, to their individual Twitters, Tumblrs, Facebooks, and Formsprings, all of which they update prolifically. To this tight-knit ""us,"" virtually everyone else is a ""them,"" to be mocked, laughed at, and fucked with. Lots of people have been noticing OFWGKTA lately, though, and no wonder: They're new and exciting and divisive and youthful, a magnet for controversy and commentary, and near-perfect think-piece-generating machines-- due in part to the brutality and stomach-turning sexual violence of their raps. At the fore of OFWGKTA's 10-member army is Tyler, the Creator, whose feral stage presence, distinctive growl, and misanthropic lyrics have won the group a legion of obstinate followers. His 2009 debut, Bastard, with its lush, Neptunes-inspired productions and starkly confessional subject matter, is a transgressive, creative burst of anxiety and absurdity. It was one of Odd Future's early catalysts, and along with 16-year-old Earl Sweatshirt's Earl and the OFWGKTA mixtape Radical, it's one of three underground classics in their pocket. While critics have attempted to square Tyler's talent with the frequent mentions of rape and murder in his rhymes (Sean Fennessey wrote a piece for Pitchfork early on, and this blog post by Pitchfork contributor Nitsuh Abebe is also essential), fans have pushed his number of Twitter followers well into six figures. And between he and Hodgy Beats' performance on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" and his excellent ""Yonkers"" single and video, the industry noticed, too: Billboard put OFWGKTA on their cover, a major label secured them to a record deal, and Diddy, Kanye, and Jay-Z all showed interest. Odd Future have earned so much attention so quickly that Tyler, the Creator kicks off his second solo release, Goblin, venting to his therapist about fame, message boards, critics, hype, expectations, media scrutiny, and being a role model-- before selling a single album. There are a lot of expectations placed on Goblin, namely, that it will serve as a potential crossover. But while that might have been the hope for a lot of those industry co-signers, or even a lot of listeners, it's clearly not Tyler's intention. Goblin does not sound like a record made by the goofy, smiling kid with the pulled-up tube socks riding Jimmy Fallon's back. Instead, it's a natural sequel to Bastard-- a dark, insular indie-rap album. Where Bastard was more accessible and inviting, this album is bleak, long, monolithic, and can be a slog to get through. It's also uncomfortable and brave-- a brutal but honest look at Tyler's image of himself. Musically, Goblin is essentially a turn-of-the-millennium indie rap record-- abstract, difficult for outsiders to locate a way in to, and bled completely of anything that resembles pop. It features almost nothing that counts as a chorus, making few gestures to the mainstream. It's a purist's record, leaning on inventive production and Tyler's flow and meter. With hindsight, then, it makes sense that the rise of Odd Future started in the avant UK music mag The Wire, which a decade ago was putting leftfield rap groups like cLOUDDEAD and Anti-Pop Consortium on its cover. In another world, before the Internet was the music industry's central delivery system, that might have been the limit of Goblin's reach-- it could have been a well-received indie hip-hop record to place alongside releases on Def Jux or Anticon. (Fittingly, it comes via XL Records, the imprint that last decade signed Dizzee Rascal, another culturally omnivorous, incredibly hyped teen rapper and producer who added a new wrinkle to independent hip-hop.) Of course, Tyler isn't interested in the political questions that drove many of his indie-rap forbearers. Instead, his primary mode of thought is negation. From the Stooges to Sex Pistols to NWA to Eminem, telling the world to fuck itself can be a compelling, even meaningful or necessary expression. Yet while each of those artists gave a multi-layered voice to specific disenfranchised groups, Tyler sounds underdeveloped when he attempts to articulate for anyone other than himself. His takes on slash-and-burn, knucklehead rap-- especially the ""kill people, burn shit, fuck school"" refrain of ""Radicals""-- is particularly cringe-worthy; stock phrases shouted with no larger purpose. Goblin is at its best when Tyler sounds isolated, frightened, and confused. It's the work of someone trying to figure out the world around him and his place within it, someone who often doesn't like the conclusions he's drawing. To his core fans, Tyler is accessible and approachable, and not just on record. He's online constantly, forging a unique bond with his listeners, and is probably right now shouting down this and other Goblin reviews. He comes across as an everyday kid. He lives with his grandmother. He likes porn; he hates collard greens. This relatability and strong audience/artist bond, and the diaristic nature of his rhymes, make him as much emo as hip-hop. His place in the indie music landscape is oddly most reminiscent of Salem, another gothic, often-derided group beloved by a core of committed young listeners but shrugged off by those with a more developed perspective. In short, he's made this record for alienated kids like himself. If you don't already like his music, you probably won't like Goblin. And that's apparently the way he wants it. For everyone else, the album remains an either/or prospect. For one, the record could have used an editor-- it'd be stronger if it were 20 minutes shorter. Yet the highs are very high: ""Yonkers"" remains a potential frontrunner for song-of-the-year, and tracks like ""Sandwitches"", ""Analog"", ""Tron Cat"", and the Frank Ocean feature ""She"" work as standalones away from the album as a whole. Tyler's most inwardly focused songs-- the therapy-session set pieces ""Goblin"", ""Nightmare"", and ""Golden""-- are also fascinating portraits from an unmoored mind struggling to remain grounded. The record's feeling of drift and desperation also lends a very different tone to the controversial nature of Tyler's raps, which even at their most sickening feel like the ramblings of a lonely outsider. His fantasies and lack of filter are still huge roadblocks for many if not most listeners. They're depraved and despicable, tied in part to a long and unfortunate legacy of gangster and street rap. They're also one aspect of a larger, character-driven story-- a license that we grant to visual arts, film, and literature but rarely to pop music. That's not to claim Tyler is making some broader commentary about the world, or gender politics, or adding multiple layers of complexity to his more violent thoughts; he's not. Instead, his more reprehensible lines come across like a pathetic attempt for an underdeveloped, disconnected mind to locate some emotionality, control, or simply attention. They certainly aren't jokes for his friends-- there's not a lot of humor on Goblin. The album really compartmentalizes the group's darkness and confusion, which makes sense because Odd Future guys like Frank Ocean and Domo Genesis usually weren't expressing anger or violence anyway. You sort of get the feeling-- since they are officially a package deal now-- that the weed stuff or the laughing-with-your-friends stuff might come out in a group effort. And even here, when other Odd Future members join Tyler, they tend to let a little light into the album-- particularly the Hodgy Beats pairings ""Sandwitches"" and ""Analog"". The coziness and camaraderie between Tyler and his cohorts even meets with a nasty end on Goblin, which concludes with a suite of tracks in which Tyler inexplicably kills his friends before suffering a total emotional breakdown. What is here is more promise than delivery, yet it's still a game-changing record for indie hip-hop-- a singular and sonically complex album neither in hoc to 1986-88 ""real"" hip-hop nor created by rappers aiming to define themselves in opposition to the mainstream. (It takes about three minutes for Tyler to align himself with other artists here, but he chooses Erykah Badu, Pusha T, and Waka Flocka Flame instead of Immortal Technique.) Alongside Lil B and Soulja Boy, OFWGKTA are harnessing the Internet to communicate directly and often and pushing a new kind of indie hip-hop-- often rambling, not always musical, frequently surprising, and absolutely beloved by some. It takes work to get through, and a lot of its success rests on cult of personality. Those two barriers are particularly why it's so successful: You have to commit to it in many ways. You have to want to be an insider. And that's a club that's quickly expanding.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15413-goblin/,XL,2011.0
240,Snoop Dogg,Doggumentary,Rap,5.5,April 8 2011,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Last summer, Snoop Dogg headlined the backpack-centric Rock the Bells tour, performing his classic debut album, Doggystyle, in full every night and drawing rapturous reviews. This year, Snoop will make a few stops on Charlie Sheen's continuous-trainwreck Violent Torpedo of Truth tour, performing a song that he and Sheen have apparently recorded together. That duality is pretty much circa-2011 Snoop in a nutshell. He's a rap legend, and he's also an unapologetically inane public figure, someone who's more famous for being famous than he is for rapping. He seems to enjoy both roles in equal measure. And so late-period Snoop albums become weird, uncentered artifacts, with no real idea or consistent personality pulling them all together. You get sweeping attempts at crossover hits, nasty street-rap throwbacks, and bizarre cross-genre collaborations that any self-aware A&R never would've allowed. And even though Snoop is nowhere near the commercial force he once was, he can still round up a fuckton of famous people whenever he decides to record an album. Not too many artists would bury their Kanye West collaborations on track 18 of their albums, but that's what Snoop does on Doggumentary, his latest reminder to the world that he's still an active musician. More than many of Snoop's recent efforts, Doggumentary has something of a sonic identity. Snoop mines slick, slapbass-heavy 1980s R&B and computer-funk on the album, working with producers like Fredwreck, Jake One, and Battlecat to conjure the smooth soul of the early Reagan era. Another rap veteran recently did great things with that same loose aesthetic playground: Big Boi on last year's excellent Sir Lucious Left Foot. But where Big Boi and his collaborators attacked that stuff with a giddy sense of experimental joy, Snoop just lets it sit there, as if his older-than-time persona will be enough to sell whatever he wants. And so vast stretches of the way-too-long Doggumentary drift by, making no impression whatsoever. Snoop is still a perfectly capable rapper, but he doesn't let off a single memorable line on the whole album. Instead, his greatest strengths now are his delivery-- he can stick right to whatever beat the world throws at him-- and his wizened, familiar voice. Since neither of these things has changed in the past decade, every new Snoop verse feels like a verse we've heard before, with the possible exception of the parts of the gently moralistic ""Peer Pressure"" where Snoop tells kids to project inner strength and resist alcohol and drugs-- messages that directly contradict almost every other song on his album. With Snoop more often than not acting as a big blank at the center of his own album, many of the best moments on Doggumentary belong to his collaborators: E-40 letting loose tumbling flows over chaotic Rick Rock production on ""My Fucn House"", R. Kelly bringing regal grace to an eerie Lex Luger beat on ""Platinum"", Devin the Dude's loping everydude warmth on the otherwise shameful ""I Don't Need No Bitch"". As for Snoop himself, the best parts come in the moments where he stops rapping altogether and sings instead, or where he raps so easily that he might as well be singing. It's surprising that he doesn't do that more often here, since the mostly-sung ""Sensual Seduction"" was his last serious solo hit. And here we get ""Boom"", with Snoop skipping lazily over a sample of Yazoo's deathless electro classic ""Situation"", and ""Wet""-- a song inexplicably written for Prince William's bachelor party-- where Snoop intones freaky come-ons through heavy Auto-Tune over the Cataracts' spaced-out synth squirts. And then there's ""Superman"", the acoustic-ramble Willie Nelson duet that absolutely shouldn't work but somehow does. Snoop and Willie are both braided, weed-addicted elder-statesman outlaw figures, so it makes sense that they'd get along. But this song, like the supremely silly 2008 Everlast collab ""My Medicine"", shows that Snoop's gravelly drawl is pretty well-suited for country music. If he ever decides to push himself again, that's one direction available to him. But let's be serious: Snoop Dogg is not pushing himself anytime soon.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15303-doggumentary/,Priority,2011.0
241,Soundgarden,Live on I-5,Rock,2.6,March 31 2011,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"The announcement of Soundgarden's 2010 reunion was exciting on several counts; first, that meant Chris Cornell would stop his fucking around with Audioslave and Timbaland. But more importantly it would be the return of the only band that really sounds like Soundgarden. While Bush, Godsmack, and Creed spawned from the most easily cloned DNA of Soundgarden's peers, few bands attempted to possess either the chops of their SST days or the dexterous, expansive pop-metal that would come later. And yet, instead of reissuing any of their mammoth LPs for a much-needed rediscovery, A&M chooses to strip mine the Soundgarden vaults for barely new compilations. Even more so than the poorly curated and bafflingly packaged hodgepodge of career retrospective Telephantasm, Live on I-5 comes off like an experiment to figure out the minimum amount of effort required to separate a Soundgarden fan from $9.99. Rather than capturing the band at the peak of its powers, I-5 documents the Down on the Upside tour that found Soundgarden worn out by that album's grueling recording sessions, punishing substance abuse, and most importantly, each other. That the title references a stretch of highway along the Pacific instead of a single venue is in itself telling: though I-5 ends up a pretty faithful recreation of Soundgarden's setlist at the time, it's pieced together from a handful of West Coast dates, and you can tell by how the crowd noise pipes in at random intervals and volumes like a hovering apparition. As such, there's really no ebb and flow, no tension, no sense that this needed to be Soundgarden's first live document. At the very least, Kim Thayil, Ben Shepherd, and Matt Cameron are highly skilled musicians doing efficient yeoman's work here-- there's an anachronistic pleasure in hearing Thayil's serpentine soloing wailing through the very unhip wah-wah pedal, and how they manage to pummel through the closing ""Jesus Christ Pose"" is nothing short of miraculous considering the torpor that precedes it. They give a very professional performance, nothing less, nothing more. So what we're basically left with is a live album whose perverse main draw is the chance to hear a good portion of Soundgarden's most iconic tracks given the Lizard King treatment by someone whose vocal cords were clearly on the business end of way too many bottles of vodka. Let's not mince words-- Chris Cornell sounds terrible here, and he's pretty much all you can hear when he takes the mic. Granted, hearing him go all Tarzan on record provided some of Soundgarden's most visceral thrills, and oddly enough, he has no problem hitting the climactic high notes of ""Spoonman"" and ""Rusty Cage"". But nearly everything else just finds his vocals tattered and flailing in and out of tune like a flag in a torrential downpour, making you wonder just how bad things really got if these were truly the top-shelf recordings. Even the choice of covers here lack inspiration-- ""Search and Destroy"" and the even more ubiquitous ""Helter Skelter"" are given Blueshammer makeovers, no different from any number of bands doing the same thing at a sports bar near you. Look, that rating up there is a reflection of the presentation, not of the underlying material: God knows any record with ""Rusty Cage"" on it deserves better. The problem is that this was, at best, a 1997 cash-grab that probably would've worked in that economic climate, and now you just get to debate whether it's a cynical move on Soundgarden's part or, more likely, something they had absolutely nothing to do with at all. If you want to get excited about their upcoming album, see them live now. Or listen to Louder Than Love, Badmotorfinger, or Superunknown-- they hold up just fine.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15272-live-on-i-5/,"Interscope,A&M",2011.0
242,Pearl Jam,Vs. [Legacy Edition],Rock,7.6,March 30 2011,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"In 2011, Pearl Jam celebrate the achievement of having been Pearl Jam for a very long time. It's their 20th anniversary, and they're marking the occasion with a blowout, yearlong victory lap: a massive curated festival, a career-spanning documentary directed by Cameron Crowe, and loving reissues of their second and third albums, Vs. and Vitalogy. It's an unusually protracted foray into the limelight for what was once a chronically spotlight-averse band, but they seem to be wearing the moment lightly, savoring it for its valedictory worth and gladly soaking up the adulation. In the years that spanned the original release of these two albums, they spent most of their effort scrambling to escape stardom, and Vs. and Vitalogy bear their struggle's deepest marks. This willful abdication of fame has become their most well-known, oft-told story, and seeing these records given lavish repackaging only highlights that it feels like ancient history now. Consider: The opening salvo in Pearl Jam's war against commercialism was their decision, for 1993's Vs., not to make a video for MTV, a situation with no present-day analogue. Their protracted feud against Ticketmaster seems similarly remote now that Pearl Jam seemingly never stop touring: whether you live in Albany, West Palm Beach, Ljubljana, or Katowice, Pearl Jam probably just stopped by or will be there shortly, treating their entire discography like an all-you-can-eat buffet. These days, few bands are more comfortable in their own skin than Pearl Jam, and the monolithic mass culture bearing down on them in 1993 has vanished into thin air. But even if the media context has long crumbled, the sound of a young band absolutely freaking the fuck out is still loud and clear on Vs. and Vitalogy, and it makes them Pearl Jam's most resonant and affecting records. Their huge-selling debut, Ten, hit with an impact that could not be repeated, and they would go on to make some very good music later in their career. But as a band, this remains their most vital and endearing period-- the last time the entire world cared deeply about what Pearl Jam would do next. Their music, as always, remains the least complex part of this equation. Pearl Jam's retooled take on classic rock was often lumpy and flat-footed, and they sounded hopelessly unfashionable next to their punk-influenced contemporaries. But focusing on these flaws, as most rock critics did and still do, misses out on the music's signature virtue, which is communication. It is this burning and self-evident need for human connection, more than anything else, that has always elevated and redeemed their most dubious efforts, and it was a quality personified by Eddie Vedder, an empathetic lead singer who transmitted a vivid emotional intensity. At its most winning, Pearl Jam's music exudes his best personality traits: warm, earnest, generous, passionate, and, yeah, harmlessly dopey sometimes. Consider, for example, Vs.'s cringe-inducing gun-control song ""Glorified G"". ""Kindred to being an American,"" Vedder pronounces in a hokey fake-jingo accent, over a corn-pone Skynyrd guitar lick: it's the sort of wince-inducing mess we get when he attempts to be caustic. Vs. is filled with this sort of clumsily wielded, early-90s political indignation, and it can make for precarious listening. Nevertheless, Vedder's anguished tenor anchors us through some rough waters-- including ""Dissident"", which, for some reason, focuses on the Lifetime movie-worthy story of a lonely spinster giving shelter to and falling for a charismatic young revolutionary, only to surrender him to the authorities. It is a profoundly ludicrous song. But the way Vedder hollers ""she gave him away,"" you'll catch yourself momentarily shaking your head in disgust at the woman's cowardice. Hell, even ""Glorified G"" boasts a killer bridge. In retrospect, however, Vs. appears as the moment where it became crystal-clear that Pearl Jam's ballads were ultimately stronger than their rockers. For all their clenched fury, songs like ""Go"", ""Animal"", and ""Blood"" mostly just thrashed awkwardly in place. ""Daughter"", by contrast, is plaintive and lovely, and ""Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town"" has survived nearly two decades of dorm-room slaughtering intact, an effortless and sunlit acoustic ballad that Rod Stewart could have written for Every Picture Tells a Story. By the time of 1994's Vitalogy, Pearl Jam had spent a lot of energy on extra-musical fights. Recorded during breaks on their strenuous Vs. tour and subject to the communication breakdown of the entire band, Vedder took his strongest hand yet in the album's direction, pushing further from arena rock pyrotechnics. Somewhere in there, the original drummer-- good-natured hesher Dave Abbruzzese-- was fired due to ""personality conflicts."" (Read: he enjoyed being famous.) The resulting album is still a defiantly weird beast, though not really in the way Vedder intended it to be. Under his direction, Vitalogy became their ""experimental"" album-- which, in Pearl Jam lingo, translates to ""the one with all the most transparently awful ideas."" On ""Spin the Black Circle"", we are treated to the spectacle of an empathetic, intuitive surfer straining to be a splenetic NYC punk rocker, while the band behind him falls over itself trying to keep pace with a simple hardcore riff. The polyrhythmic chanting of ""Aya Davanita"" sounds like corporate-retreat weekend warriors seeking their inner third eye in a drum circle. The accordion-and-tuba spoken-word of ""Bugs"" is an avert-your eyes, car-crash attempt at Captain Beefheart surrealism. And ""Hey, Foxymophandelmama, That's Me"" is an eight-minute sound collage featuring snippets of dialog from mental patients. Here's the funny thing, though, about all of Vitalogy's ill-advised wandering-- it paid off elsewhere. Through all these misadventures, you can hear what was once the most rigid rhythmic backbone in rock began to stretch and pull like taffy, so that when Pearl Jam relax into a Stooges/MC5 proto-punk groove on ""Last Exit"", they sound rough, loose and limber like never before. In the snarling, adenoidal ""Satan's Bed"", Vedder actually manages one or two acerbically funny lines. It all came together on ""Corduroy"", which moves fluidly from quiet brooding to seething explosions to, in the chorus, a simple, humane plea, set to Vedder's single greatest melody. ""Corduroy""'s famous plea, of course, was from Vedder to his own too-adoring fans. ""I don't wanna be held in your debt,"" he sang shakily to millions-- and, entranced, they screamed it back at him. The poignancy of Vitalogy, and the source of its actual weirdness, is how it veers from Vedder's impulse to hide from everyone and his instinctual desire to reach out. Nothing captures these warring impulses better than ""Nothingman"" and ""Better Man"", two folk-rock pillars of their catalog that are as open-hearted and yearning as anything they ever wrote. Even when he was trying his hardest to scowl at the world, Vedder couldn't help feeling, all over the place, for everyone. Misanthropy was always unbecoming on him. Most of his best, most beloved, and resonant songs are about other people's problems: ""Nothingman"", ""Better Man"", ""Daughter"", ""Elderly Woman"". In concert, the kiss-off of ""Corduroy"" has become Pearl Jam's most joyful, communal moment. Live, Pearl Jam have always been a legendarily intense experience, and they've made an alarmingly consistent practice of making at least momentary believers out of anyone who sees them. The Vitalogy and Vs. reissues come bundled with a recording of the band at their early peak, at a 1994 show at Boston's Orpheum. It's a rousing set, and it opens compellingly, on Ten's slow-burn ""Oceans"". But years of live-Pearl-Jam-recording fatigue has dulled the impact of another official release-- this is a band that once decided to officially release every single show of a world tour, after all-- and Live at the Orpheum Theatre contains no real revelations. As they have done for years, they cover Neil Young's ""Fuckin' Up"" (the version on Live on Two Legs hits harder.) They play ""Even Flow""; they don't play ""Jeremy"". The only real surprises are when Vedder drastically changes the words to ""Immortality"", and when he brings out Mudhoney's Mark Arm for a vicious rip through the Dead Boys' ""Sonic Reducer"". (Unable to bring himself to utter the dreaded g-word, he introduces Arm as ""one of the forefathers of... uh... all the great music that everyone listens to."") It's a fine set, but it's hardly necessary. In the ensuing decade-plus after Vs. and Vitalogy, Pearl Jam have gone from utter exile to a comfortable perch on the fringes. That's where they sit now, finding refuge in their live shows, which have developed a traveling-cult aura that clearly recalls the Grateful Dead's. For the members of Pearl Jam, however, the live shows don't just bring together their faithful; they rewrite the band's own troubled history. In 2011, it doesn't matter what song they drag out in concert: ""Lukin"", the one-minute punk brain-fart from No Code? The poignant but relatively rare B-side single ""I Got Id""? The ukulele song from Binaural? No worries: The crowd knows every word and will go absolutely apeshit for it. They can thrash joyfully through ""Spin the Black Circle"" as if Jeff Ament and Mike McCready didn't grit their way through the recording session. Hell, they can even play ""Bugs"" live now if they want. These days, they have the aura of happy, weathered warriors, proud to have just made it out together. The live show remains the most optimal set of conditions to give yourself over to their ham-fisted grandeur; go see them, if you have a chance. They'll be by soon.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15263-vs-legacy-edition-vitalogy-legacy-edition-live-at-the-orpheum-theatre-boston/,"Legacy,Legacy,Legacy",2011.0
243,Queen,Queen,Rock,6.7,March 24 2011,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Fucking Queen. For all their reported bombast, pomp, and tendency to overshoot and double-slaughter any semblances of good taste, everything you've heard about them is still true. They're one of the few phenomena who deliver on the hype, regardless of how you approach them. Hate or love proggy album suites? Doesn't matter, Queen will make you feel good about your choice. Can't stand operatic drama, or can't get enough unitard-clad frontmen? Love to hate prime 1970s hard rock with arena sheen? Welcome to the greatest/most horrible band of the 20th century. They did and wanted it all. Yet, so much of Queen's music is still under-recognized even by people who know and love the hits. Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara on the British colony of Zanzibar, East Africa), guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bassist John Deacon comprised one of the most successful, effective, and productive bands of the rock era-- indeed, by some estimates, the most successful rock band of all time (having spent more time atop the UK album charts than any other act). And how did they do this? With: a gay male lead singer who specialized in operatic vocals and classically classed piano playing; an insanely talented lead guitarist who may actually have been more valuable as a songwriter or quasi-orchestral arranger of his instrument; a drummer who not only possessed the highest vocal register in the band (and this is Queen we're talking [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| about), but also arguably the greatest songwriting range; a non-singing bassist who managed to pen one of the greatest karaoke anthems of all time, ""Another One Bites the Dust"". Like the Beatles, Queen capitalized on major group synergy, and as a result, forged a career that was as varied and resourceful as any act in rock. Queen formed in late 1970, when Mercury (late of art school) joined up with May and Taylor (late of the Cream-ish band Smile). Deacon joined the following year, and the newly dubbed Queen played shows, rehearsed, and recorded their self-titled debut. Though they had to wait a couple of years for a release, Queen is quite clearly the work of an assured group of young men. May's album opener ""Keep Yourself Alive"" was an early anthem and showcase for his multi-tracked guitar. It didn't really have the operatic flair of the band's later hits, but it was catchy, well-produced, and just ridiculously easy to fist-pump along to in concert. Mercury-penned songs like ""Great King Rat"" and ""My Fairy King"" offered ample evidence where Queen's more precocious interests lie, though even then, the songs rocked way harder than their titles let on. Indeed, a song like ""Son and Daughter"" is like the lovechild of Black Sabbath and Ziggy Stardust, taking the most potent attributes of both, and refusing to tone down anything in favor of a harmonious mix. And they were just getting started. Queen II-- the first of two albums they released in 1974-- was the mini-breakthrough. Part of this was due to diving with abandon into recording experimentation, particularly the elaborate vocal and guitar overdubs that would soon become the band's trademarks. May wrote most of the music for the album's ""Side White"": the stately (if modest by Queen standards) guitar prelude ""Procession"" leads directly into the still-statelier would-be rock anthem ""Father to Son"". Sounding like a hippie-era group sing-along crammed face-first into murky, early-70s proto-metal, it's another good example of Queen's penchant for at least attempting to unite disparate musical worlds-- even if the end result was more than a bit bloated. However, Mercury's ""Side Black"" was the masterstroke, and the first real evidence of the double-decker Fabergé egg that would become Queen's career on record. ""Ogre Battle"" (a live holdover from the time of the first record) begins with a long, ominous fade into screeching vocal harmonies and flailing, backwards drums and guitars. The song busts and tumbles its way into the ""The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke"", a dry run for the kind of music-hall rock they'd perfect with the next album's ""Killer Queen"", and which should probably win a few awards as the world's most apt Queen song title. ""Nevermore"" is a piano and vocal ballad that nicely introduces the album's central epic (and direct ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" precursor) ""The March of the Black Queen"". And the people noticed: The album produced a UK hit with a remake of the up-tempo gallop ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" from the debut. Dizzying, overstuffed, and unflinching, Queen II is a die-hard fan favorite, and arguably the band's most underrated record. Sheer Heart Attack (also 1974) not only improves on every aspect of their sound suggested by the first two records, but delivers some of the finest music of their career. First off, the band had mastered the recording studio. Tracks like the hit ""Killer Queen"", ""In the Lap of the Gods"", and the hyper-vaudeville ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown"" simply could not have appeared on previous records due to the complexity of the arrangements, and the amazing job by the band and producer Roy Thomas Baker in getting umpteen dozens of overdubs and edits to sound like cohesive recordings. And they rocked! ""Stone Cold Crazy"" predates speed-metal (and was eventually covered by Metallica), ""Brighton Rock"" was May's theretofore best guitar showcase, and for heaven's sake, ""In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited"" ends the album with an explosion. Even Taylor's ""Tenement Funster"" (sample lyric: ""My new purple shoes been amazing the people next door"") and Deacon's bouncy ""Misfire"" bring good things to the table.  This is the band at the height of its powers. After ""Killer Queen"" and Sheer Heart Attack, there was no looking back. 1975's A Night at the Opera was reportedly the most expensive album ever produced at the time, and even if the only thing you knew about it was that it contained ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", you'd have a pretty good idea of the kind of record to expect. Yet the fun hardly stopped there: ""Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)"" was a heavy, hilarious kiss-off from Mercury to their former manager; ""Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon"" and ""Seaside Rendezvous"" were further entries into the band's vaudeville-rock canon; ""You're My Best Friend"" was Deacon's first big hit for Queen, while Taylor's ""I'm in Love With My Car"" was another good, slyly funny rocker. And if you're still in need of fireworks, May's ""The Prophet's Song"" features an amazing solo-through-delay vocal performance from Mercury that eventually transforms into a call-response choir, and further still into one of May's best guitar solos. No punches pulled, no expense spared: A Night at the Opera was Queen at the top of the mountain. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 1976's A Day at the Races feels a bit retread. Even down to its Marx Brothers-derived title, the album doesn't retain the same quantum-leap progression from its predecessor as the ones had before. Indeed ""The Millionaire Waltz"" borrows liberally from ""Bohemian Rhapsody""; classical piano playing, massive vocal overdubs, and a big rock breakdown-- but without much of the surprise or humor. Rather, the best tracks here are the ones where Queen is willing to go outside of their already established template: ""You Take My Breath Away"" is one of Mercury's best ballads, sung without a trace of irony or camp, and a good example of the band's perhaps underrated abilities as songwriters. ""Somebody to Love"" was the record's biggest hit, and positions Mercury as the gospel church soloist amidst walls of choral backdrop (i.e. him, May, and Taylor). Taylor's ""Drowse"" is a hazily burnt (dare I say ""chill""?) piece of psychedelia that sounds unlike anything else in Queen's catalog-- and is yet another reminder of the power in the band's democratic songwriting ethos. As much as any band, Queen commands the best audio quality money can buy, and these remasters sound great. There are lots of new bonus tracks, live versions, and B-sides-- none of which are required listening but-- particularly in the cases of the a cappella vocal tracks for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown""-- are good fun for fans. Furthermore, the Deep Cuts: 1973-1976 disc is an admirable attempt to introduce some of Queen's non-hit album tracks to folks otherwise familiar only with the band's UK #1s (all 18 of them)-- though it contains nothing previously unreleased. Still, bang for the buck has always been one of Queen's strong points: Jump in, be prepared for anything, and most of all, check your modesty at the door.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15221-reissues/,"Island,Island,Island,Island,Island,Island",2011.0
244,James Brown,"James Brown: The Singles, Volume Ten: 1975-1979",Rock,5.1,March 14 2011,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"By the time James Brown's last great band slowly collapsed in 1975, it was clear that something was going terribly wrong. Once so far ahead of all of his R&B contemporaries that every new single provoked an international scramble to figure out his new groove, he'd now settled into repeating himself-- ""Superbad, Superslick"" was a drained, brittle remake of his four-year-old single ""Super Bad""-- or, worse, imitating his imitators. The minor hit ""Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)"" was simply a hoarse JB lyric set to a note-for-note ripoff of David Bowie's ""Fame"". From the first seven tracks on this volume of Hip-O's mail-order series-- which also include a pair of wretched doo-wop covers and two tedious versions of a University of Georgia football fight song-- you might guess that Brown's career was crashing and burning. (The lengthy funk jam ""Everybody Wanna Get Funky One More Time"", the final release on his People label, sounds like a farewell for which he's rousing whatever oomph he's got left.) But Brown had long since mastered the art of throwing off his cape and rushing back to the microphone just as he was being led offstage. ""I'm back!"" he declared at the beginning of ""Get Up Offa That Thing"", the first record on which he figured out how to integrate his vamp-and-stab funk into the new disco sound. He was rewarded with a substantial hit, and followed it up with a few more dance records that were reasonably solid, if not quite groundbreaking: ""Bodyheat"", ""Give Me Some Skin"", ""The Spank"". Still, the old master wasn't quite at home in the new era-- compared to the freewheeling funk records he was making even a couple of years earlier, they were clenched-up and uncomfortable. So the fascinating stuff on Volume Ten is, for the most part, perversely fascinating. A soupy ""Love Me Tender"", recorded a few months after Elvis's death, begins with a little first-take monologue: ""You know--oh, hi, this is James Brown. The Godfather of Soul?-- I wanna talk about a good friend..."" ""People Who Criticize"" (when artists come up with titles like that, you know there's a problem) isn't good, exactly, but it's bugging out with sheer spirit, including a bungled but vehement piano solo and a minute and a half of unhinged scat singing at the end. The Gershwin standard ""Summertime"" is one of the few times Brown's longtime backup singer Martha High ever got to step into the spotlight--although, for Brown, it's an excuse to chatter about how ""I'm just so disgusted, because Mother Nature didn't intend for the things that are happenin'."" And then there's ""For Goodness Sakes, Look at Those Cakes"", the most joyful and most ridiculous of his disco records-- an ass-watcher's diary, at a much faster tempo than ""Hot Pants"". (Brown had evidently forgotten how to pull off slow funk.) When it stiffed, Polydor announced that either Brown would have to turn himself over to another producer, or they were done with trying to promote his rusty funk and soggy ballads to an audience that had moved on. The result was an album called The Original Disco Man-- an appeal to nostalgia and respect--led by ""It's Too Funky in Here"", his first single with staying power in a few years. Produced by Brad Shapiro, it sounded like no James Brown record before it, slick, modern and rubbery. The voice on top of it retained its force and rasp and pouncing sense of rhythm: nothing could take those away. But the days of his old slogan, ""A James Brown Production-- The Sound of Success"", were gone for good.

Venting about his decision to drop the record his own way, he took to Twitter on March 1: ""i. did. this. not ISLAND DEF JAM. that's why you see no label logo on the artwork that I DID. guess its my fault for trusting my dumbass lawyer and signing my career over to a failing company. fuck Def Jam & any company that goes the length of signing a kid with dreams & talent w/ no intention of following through. fuck em. now back to my day. i want some oatmeal and toast. brunch swag."" The mini-rant sums up this singer's demeanor well-- openly passionate and heartfelt, but also attractively off-center and humble. Nostalgia, Ultra finds Ocean singing over a mix of original pop-leaning R&B beats courtesy of big-ticket producers like Tricky Stewart (Rihanna's ""Umbrella"", Beyonce's ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)"") and Midi Mafia (50 Cent's ""21 Questions"", Justin Bieber's ""Down to Earth"") as well as some eclectic remakes of songs including Coldplay's underrated 2009 single ""Strawberry Swing"", MGMT's ""Electric Feel"", and, most surprisingly, the Eagles' ""Hotel California"". Ocean's experience within the major-label hit machine comes through-- his casually hook-y voice is akin to Usher or Jamie Foxx's, and at least three of the album's songs could (and should) slot in comfortably on a R&B or even Top 40 radio station near you any day now. There are distinct elements of Drake's melancholic paranoia and The-Dream's high melodrama, too. But there's also a heady surreality surrounding Nostalgia, Ultra that makes it unique. The cover-- showing a bright orange 1980s BMW (Ocean's ""dream car"") hidden in plain sight amidst lush greenery-- is perfectly indicative of what's inside. The record is held together by tiny interludes named after 1990s video games in which the unmistakable sounds of a cassette player rewinding, fast-forwarding, and stopping are heard. The old-school touch lends Nostalgia, Ultra the feel of a personal, friend-to-friend mixtape rather than one made by a name-dropping hip-hop DJ. The impressionistic, fingerprint details don't stop there. On the brief segue ""Bitches Talkin'"", a loving snippet of Radiohead's ""Optimistic"" is heard while Ocean sincerely laments how ""all bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?""-- not exactly the type of sentiment you'd expect to hear on any sort of R&B album. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman's adulterous bedroom soliloquy from Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut can be heard underneath the murderous ""Lovecrimes"", adding a sense of manic dread. The film is once again referenced on the nightmarish, Stewart-produced ""Novacane"", which has Ocean losing his senses in the company of a wannabe dentist/porn star he met at Coachella. And if that sounds kind of ridiculous, that's probably the point; the atmospheric track almost reads like a knowing parody of Kid Cudi's fame-as-drug diatribes. The shout outs to Kubrick's mysterious and lusty final masterpiece aren't just artsy braggadocio-- they make sense within Ocean's trickily complex world, too. Like on brooding highlight ""Swim Good"", where he steers his Lincoln Town Car straight into California's crashing waves. ""I'm about to drive in the ocean,"" he sings, heart-battered. ""I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me."" He lightens up on the self-reflexive pop winner ""Songs for Women"" and the MGMT-sampling Garden of Eden fuck ode ""Nature Feels"", but, no matter the mood, this songwriter is always quick to add fine particulars that make his songs his songs. At 23, Ocean is a few years older than his mostly-teenage friends in Odd Future. And his maturity is apparent not only in his vastly more laid-back style but also in how he deals with the underlying sense of abandonment and rejection that ignites much of Odd Future's bloody, cuss-laden vengeance. ""Fuck a deal, I just want my father's e-mail so I can tell him how much I hate him in detail,"" seethes crew leader Tyler, the Creator on the title track of his album Bastard. Ocean grew up fatherless too, according to his wrenching revamp of Mr. Hudson's ""There Will Be Tears"", but he handles his feelings differently. ""My friend said it wasn't so bad/ You can't miss what you ain't had/ Well, I can-- I'm sad,"" he wails, letting his guard down completely. And the fact that Tyler and Frank are smart enough to see their thematic kinship beneath all the aesthetic disparities bodes well for both.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15172-nostalgia-ultra/,Self-released,2011.0
246,Radiohead,The King of Limbs,Rock,7.9,February 24 2011,Mark Pytlik,Contributor,"Now that the music on In Rainbows has had four years to outshine its launch mechanism, it's easy to forget that the album originally came bundled with an honest attempt to solve a business problem. The pay-what you-think-is-fair system wasn't just Radiohead being magnanimous, it was using their popularity and their newly won independence to ask what might have been the single most important question facing a shaken music industry: What is an album in the download era actually worth to fans? Announced on Monday of last week and then chucked out to rabid fans like flank steak a day ahead of schedule, the band's eighth album dispenses with the honesty-box pricing model but still finds them using their influence to interrogate the terms around how we consume and relate to music. Containing a slight eight tracks across 37 minutes, The King of Limbs is Radiohead's first album to clock in under the 40-minute mark, falling into that limbo between a modern full-length and an EP. What's more, it feels like it stops short intentionally, almost confrontationally, as if Radiohead are trying to ask a new kind of question about their music. ""None of us want to get into that creative hoo-ha of a long-play record again,"" Thom Yorke told The Believer in August 2009. ""It's just become a real drag. It worked with In Rainbows because we had a real fixed idea about where we were going. But we've all said that we can't possibly dive into that again. It'll kill us."" This wouldn't be the first time that a member of Radiohead publicly fantasized about disowning the album format, but it might have been the most convincing. How better to unburden themselves of the stress of making more records in the mold of The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac, and In Rainbows than by simply changing the terms of their engagement? Radiohead's eighth record, The King of Limbs, represents a marked attempt to create a considered and cohesive unit of music that nonetheless sits somewhere outside of the spectrum of their previous full-length discography. And that's not to say that it doesn't ripple with the dazzling sonics or scenery that have become the band's stock in trade, but just that, unlike so many of their milestones, there's no abiding sense of a band defying all expectations in order to establish new precedents. Instead, we get eight songs that feel mostly like small but natural evolutions of previously explored directions. Opener ""Bloom"" announces Radiohead's return with a scattershot sequence of chewed-up drum loops and peeling horns that dissolve into a rhythmic tangle. ""Morning Mr. Magpie"" re-casts an old live acoustic ballad in a more anxious light, its once-sunny disposition frozen into an icy glare. With its crumbling guitar shapes and clattering, fizzing percussion work, ""Little By Little"" sounds dilapidated and rundown. Meanwhile, ""Feral"" contorts Yorke's voice into a reverb-infused, James Blake-like wriggle that pings around the stereo channel against a mulched up drum pattern that sounds sharper than glass. In this more rhythmic first half of the album, electronic percussion figures in heavily as usual, but also with heightened emphasis on drummer Phil Selway's uneven time signatures. The previously well-rounded band dynamic, meanwhile, feels like it's been reduced to a miniaturized version of itself. This isn't the band that ripped through ""Bodysnatchers""; these guys play with a precise, almost scientific restraint that suits the twitchy anxiety of these songs well. Things open up on the softer, dreamier second side, as rhythms recede and more traditional song structures take over. ""Lotus Flower"", the lead single presumably for having a chorus and not being a ballad, finds Yorke delivering a series of slippery hooks in slinky falsetto mode. Album highlights ""Codex"" and ""Give Up the Ghost"" follow, the former a narcotized cousin to ""Pyramid Song"" that features woozily flanged piano chords, long, plaintive horn trills, and Yorke at his most evocative; the latter an acoustic, guitar-led call-and-response that finds him piling falsettos into a gorgeously ramshackle wall of harmony. Last is ""Separator"", a clear-eyed, mid-tempo closer that mixes 1990sâ€“era Radiohead with a touch of Neil Young-inspired guitar work and ends on a sweet and easy note that's miles away from the complicated clatter it began with. Compared to such a dense first half, there's something satisfying about all the open space in the album's final stretch; before you know it, the record's breezed by. It's a nice packing trick, one that makes the album feel even lighter than its 37 minutes. So: eight tracks, each of them worth your time, and yet The King of Limbs is still likely to go down as Radiohead's most divisive record. A trawl through message boards and social networks leaves the impression that many disappointed fans are still struggling to make sense of the gap between the greatness of the thing they got and the genius of the thing they thought they might get. It's in that gap, when assessing the album overall, that it's easy to get tangled up. This is well-worn terrain for Radiohead, and while it continues to yield rewarding results, the band's signature game-changing ambition is missed.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15149-the-king-of-limbs/,"XL,TBD",2011.0
247,Johnny Cash,Bootleg Volume 2: From Memphis to Hollywood,Folk/Country,6.7,February 23 2011,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Although he had already signed with Sun Records, Johnny Cash was still struggling as a musician in 1955, taking gigs around Memphis with the Tennessee Two but not yet landing a strong hit single. To make ends meet, he worked at the Home Equipment Company selling venetian blinds, and it was his employer that sponsored his first radio show on KWEM. In May 1955, he played his first show live in the studio, and those 15 minutes are the centerpiece of the latest Johnny Cash reissue, the second in what will hopefully be a long bootleg series. Besides the fact that he sings only three songs and Luther Perkins plays a short instrumental, what's surprising about this short set is how awkward Cash comes across: As a musician, he's confident and clever with that booming voice and careful phrasing, and the Tennessee Two are just as energetic and tight as ever. Reading the ad copy for the Home Equipment Company's inventory of blinds and fencing, however, Cash speaks haltingly and stumbles a bit over his words, peppering his commendations with odd pauses and rhythms. He comes off as the exact opposite of the cool, smooth-talking peddler, and maybe that made him a much more trustworthy spokesman. That radio program is an intriguing time capsule from an era when radio was much more localized when Cash was young and unschooled, and it's almost a winking punchline that it's followed by an announcement for a concert in which Cash gets seventh billing. It's an intriguing glimpse of the artist at his most human, before he became an industry. As such it's the heart of From Memphis to Hollywood, the second volume in Columbia's bootleg series-- a reminder that Cash started out humbly before he became legendary (the radio show was also included on a bonus disc in The Legend box set in 2005). Nearly eight years after his death, it's difficult to get any critical distance on Cash, as his music is so wrapped up in his larger-than-life persona. So hearing him in this radio setting is a good reminder that there is much about him that remains unexamined and unconsidered. However, that's really the only revelatory moment on From Memphis to Hollywood, which collects demos and rarities and generally reinforces common perceptions of the Man in Black. There are 11 solo demos that he recorded from 1954 through 1957, but the only surprise is that ""I Walk the Line"" was originally written to be a dour ballad. We get acoustic versions of hits like ""Get Rhythm"" and obscurities like ""My Treasure"", most of which are performed in a necessarily stark way that seems to prefigure his American Recordings albums. Some songs sound good in this setting while others are obvious demos, but the percussive wallop of the Tennessee Two is sorely missed. It's actually refreshing that they figure so prominently in the Sun Records demos produced by Sam Phillips and Cowboy Jack Clement. It's obvious why the label signed the trio: These versions of ""Leave That Junk Alone"" and ""Big River"" percolate with prickly energy, and Cash exhibits fresh interpretive range. He and the Two rumble through an abortive take on Jimmie Rodgers' ""Brakeman's Blues"", which sounds like it's destined to fall apart, and deliver a poignant version of Leadbelly's ""Goodnight Irene"". With a sense of organizational purpose and of local music history, the first disc depicts Cash an artist hungry for success and willing to sell venetian blinds to get there. When he signed with Columbia records in 1958, he and his family moved out to Los Angeles, where Cash continued to record and dabbled in acting. There are many fine songs and many mediocre songs on the second disc, which spans 1958 through 1969. There's Cash singing a taut version of ""Five Minutes to Live"" and waxing nostalgic on ""Send a Picture of Mother"". He does story-songs about outlaws and soldiers, some of which are still wrenching (""Hardin Wouldn't Run"") and some of which have aged poorly (""Johnny Reb""). And then there's ""Shifting, Whispering Sands"", perhaps one of the most over-the-top recordings Cash ever made, complete with narration by Lorne Greene, best known as Ben Cartwright on ""Bonanza"". The portrait of Cash on this second disc is, unfortunately, fuzzy and poorly defined. It showcases everything we know about him and very little we don't know. His voice sounds just as deep and authoritative as ever, his tastes just as broad, his concerns just as grave, but we've heard him in these settings countless times. There are no discoveries to make among these songs, no secrets to untangle-- in other words, nothing that adds much detail to our understanding of the artist or his career. That's not an indictment of Columbia's bootleg series, which launched in 2006 with archival recordings that Cash made primarily for himself. That collection showed the private man away from the crowds and the cameras, when he had a few moments alone. Hopefully there are more volumes on the way, perhaps compiling his output from the late 1970s through the early 1990s-- a lost chapter of his life when he was considered old hat among Nashville hat acts and was banished to dinner club purgatory. That's a Johnny Cash we don't know very well, and a glimpse of the casual, private, work-in-progress side of those years would make him all the more fascinating.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15046-bootleg-volume-2-from-memphis-to-hollywood/,Legacy,2011.0
248,Gorillaz,The Fall,"Electronic,Rock",5.8,January 6 2011,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"""It can be anything you want it to be. This is the nearest we have got to seeing what I would call a universal machine."" That's British artist David Hockney talking about the iPad. Hockney does sketches on his, using an app called Brushes, and several of his works are already hanging this month in an exhibition at the Pierre BergÃ©-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation in Paris. Hockney is presumably drawn to the novelty as much as to the functionality of Apple's curious device, which is like a big iPhone that won't make calls, or like a small laptop without a keyboard. Rather than render it redundant or limited, those disabilities have made it as universal as Hockney attests, attracting hundreds of thousands of users ranging from my mom to Damon Albarn, who recorded the new Gorillaz album on his iPad. The Fall, released for free on Christmas, is a nice marketing gimmick and the product of Albarn's restlessness on tour. While Hockney's sketches clearly look like they were done on some kind of computer, nothing about Albarn's songs reveals their origins. Instead, The Fall possesses the crisply eccentric production value of a typical Gorillaz album, which may be a testament to the iPad's ability to manipulate and combine sound files with little loss of fidelity or complexity. On the other hand, it doesn't appear to handle hip-hop very well. The Fall contains opens stretches of loping, belching beats that are painstakingly crafted yet often sound like they've been created as backdrops for MC cameos. But there's only one guest, a barely recognizable Bobby Womack on ""Bobby in Phoenix""; otherwise, it's Albarn singing and creating songs, which gives The Fall the feel of a solo album. At times it needs other voices to liven up some of these long stretches. Even so, it's fitting that Albarn has released it under the Gorillaz moniker. For one thing, that band has always had a strong visual component that makes the cartoon/hologram characters seem like they were meant to be up- and downloaded, so it's not hard to imagine them trapped in an iPad like General Zod at the end of Superman II. Songs like ""Revolving Doors"" and ""Detroit"" have the same hazily martial beats that have marked the Gorillaz' output since ""Clint Eastwood"", which makes The Fall slot neatly into the Gorillaz catalog. It's less a proper album like Demon Days or Plastic Beach-- more an auxiliary item like that live album or that G-Sides comp or that remix album (or, in Albarn's career as a whole, like his lowkey, homemade Democrazy set.) Albarn's mode may be somber and road-weary, but there's not a whole lot of heft here, which means it sounds like a unified outtakes record rather than a major statement. Thematically, it's a tour album, leaving behind the Pacific Ocean trash island of Plastic Beach for the highways of America, evoked in songs named after Phoenix, Aspen, Dallas, Detroit, Seattle, and Amarillo. With its rangey beats and garbled transmission noises, ""The Parish of Space Dust"" imagines a Texas as expansive as the cosmos, but it's just enough to make you wish Albarn had incorporated some southwestern influences the way Plastic Beach used island rhythms to bolster its setting. Despite the emphasis on atmosphere that pervades the album and that seems like a necessary byproduct of its creative technology, The Fall may be the most earthbound Gorillaz album yet-- and at times, therefore, the most banal. At his best, Albarn manages to create an alien ambience, as if visiting America has made him feel as out-of-place as certain travelers must have felt around Roswell. Still, he's always passing through, never stopping for a visit, and as a result, The Fall is a blur. Whether as an album or as a touring document, it doesn't add up to much of a statement, which means the particulars of its creation will probably always overshadow whatever life this album may find.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14966-the-fall/,EMI,2010.0
249,J. Cole,Friday Night Lights,Rap,7.3,November 29 2010,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"It should've been J. Cole's big night: the long-awaited release of the Jay-Z protégé's Friday Night Lights mixtape on November 12. Instead, the spotlight fell to another Jay: Jay Electronica, who joined Cole on Jay-Z's Roc Nation imprint that night, being introduced by Hova himself at a media-heavy Manhattan gathering, in front of a bunch of writers who would've otherwise been home downloading Cole's mixtape. ""This 'posed to be a moment,"" Cole yells on the tape's intro, as if protesting preemptively. Beyond their first initial, Cole and Electronica have a lot in common. They're both Southerners who specialize in conscientious, Nas-Style New York rap, and devote their grainy drawls to complex rhyme patterns and even more complex introspection. But Jay Elec is an effortless enigma, a guy who can (and will) rattle off absolute nonsense and make it sound like the deepest thing you ever heard. Cole, in contrast, is the honor student who overthinks everything: Each boast or proposition comes with some sort of tortured justification. It's not enough for him to enjoy the spoils of his success; he has to spell out to us that he's doing it for everyone else who grew up poor in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He's a striver, and he sounds like one. Friday Night Lights is almost entirely a self-produced affair, and it's to Cole's credit that he knows what makes him sound good, even if he does lean too hard on the tinkly piano sound he loves. On the great summer single ""Who Dat"", Cole came off tense and purposeful, as if he were trying to elbow his way onto radio playlists through sheer force of will. Friday Night Lights finds him in a more expansive mode, getting into the minutiae of his own personal story over exclusively midtempo beats. At its best, the tape has an organic warmth that lends it an immediate approachability. At its worst-- the inevitable dragging moments that come with any hour-plus mix focusing mostly on one voice-- that organic pose fades into an all-surface gleam that doesn't really suit Cole at all. When he raps over the rippling lilt of Erykah Badu's ""Didn't Cha Know"", it's perfect. When he raps over Missy Elliott and Aaliyah's gorgeously still ""Best Friends"", it isn't. But Cole is, in the grand scheme, new to this, and there's a good chance he'll figure this stuff out. Like the TV show that shares its name, Friday Night Lights is an affecting tale of small-town people trying to figure out their paths in life. Cole, who left Fayetteville for college in New York City, explores bits of his own story that little rap music has found space to address-- like being the one college kid who made it out, then returning home to realize that many of his old friends are in prison or Iraq. Or digging into the fluidity of class, and the weird effects it can have on a kid's psyche: ""Me, I lived it all, from dirt poor in a trailer/ Worried about my mother and never trusting my neighbors/ To middle class with a backyard and my own room/ To being the only black kid in my homeroom."" In one painfully vivid moment, he finds himself jealous of the white kids whose parents sent them to school with Lunchables. In another, he wonders whether college was really the best way out: ""One year cost 'bout the same as a Mercedes/ Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby."" But those sharp moments don't make up the whole of Friday Night Lights, and Cole wanders into less convincing territory when he rants that people never buy music anymore (though he himself has barely released any music that you can actually buy) or when he talks to the ladies. Loverman songs on mixtapes rarely work, but one exception to the rule is Drake, who shows up here to breeze through ""In the Morning"", absolutely schooling Cole on his own track. Cole tries to get clever with this stuff, and it almost always turns out badly; he actually rhymes ""Rihanna"" with ""vee-gina."" Cole's restless intelligence works against him almost as much as it helps him; you end up wishing he'd just take some delight in a new car or some nice clothes without reminding us, again and again, that he used to be poor. While it's a major theme in rap-- if not the major theme in rap-- that up-from-nothing rise is implicit for most rappers, something to be touched on, not to continually fall back on.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14883-friday-night-lights/,Roc Nation,2010.0
250,Lil Wayne,I Am Not a Human Being,Rap,6.7,October 5 2010,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"Lil Wayne is not back. Not yet. As of this writing, he's due to be released from the Eric M. Taylor Center at Rikers Island on November 4. But even when he switches from inmate #02616544L to Dwayne Carter, free man, will he return as the world beater who stunned us with mixtapes like Dedication 2 and albums like Tha Carter III or will he continue to explore (um) riskier sonic territory Ã¡ la Rebirth? And, considering his penchant toward exuberant rhymes and a lifestyle blissfully unaware of the word ""no,"" will we ever see the same Wayne that stomped straight into the camera rapping ""I'd rather be pushin' flowers than to be in the pen sharin' showers,"" in the ""A Milli"" video? On July 22, 2007, just hours before he would be caught with the .40 caliber pistol that would eventually land him in jail, I saw Wayne end a triumphant NYC show at the famed, fancy Beacon Theater by blaring Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" through the speakers. That night he was funny and dangerous and unpredictable. So: Even when Wayne ends his eight months of forced containment, will that Wayne really be back? As we prepare to find out, we first get I Am Not a Human Being, an album's worth of material recorded before his jail stint and featuring some tracks originally intended for his proper return LP, Tha Carter IV. The record is supposed to act as a reminder of his existence and a precursor to his freedom. And, since it's a genuine hip-hop record with Wayne rapping most of the time, it helps to put his guitar-torturing, choke-throttling Rebirth incarnation to rest. I Am Not a Human Being is the latest in a long line of songs and videos Wayne has appeared on since entering Rikers on March 8; we've seen green-screened versions of him in clips with Eminem, along with his Young Money cohorts Drake and Nicki Minaj. These appearances are meant to show his resiliency and relevancy but oftentimes come off a little depressing-- since he's usually standing in front of an obviously phony and confined backdrop, the videos emphasize his absence more than anything else. I Am Not a Human Being draws a similarly conflicted response. He's there but he's not there. We get Wayne spouting classic Weezy-isms-- explicit sex, cartoonish gunplay, and allusions to the intricacies of the digestive system abound-- over at-least-decent original beats, several of which attempt to replicate the space-snap wallop of his biggest hit, ""Lollipop"". But there's a lingering sense that the rapper is not in top gear; his flow is often slow and static, his wordplay lively yet less energized than what we're now used to. When he says, ""I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane,"" or, ""So far ahead of them, I feel outdated"" in this context, the lines could be taken as a boasts or sighs. And while Wayne was presumably aware of his impending jail term during the recording of some of these tracks, you'd never know it. The most real-life anxiety shown is on the title Run-D.M.C.-style track, when he admits, ""Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops."" It's a far cry from his ""A Milli"" invincibility: ""Tell the coppers: 'Hahahaha!'/ You can't get him, you can't stop him."" There is one distinct upshot. The finest three songs on I Am Not a Human Being all feature the man who has quickly become Wayne's best-ever counterpart, Drake. The two rappers' contrasting qualities-- Wayne is coarse and random and hoarse while Drake is smooth and exact and clear-- bring out surprising sides of each other. On the sweet-soul track ""With You"", the Pretty Toney-style beat and Drake's croon draw out Wayne at his most human. Meanwhile, the superhero-synth track ""Right Above It"" would seemingly fit well on an idealized Tha Carter IV with Drake rhyming breathless as Wayne handles the Auto-Hook. The two have teased at a full collaborative album and, considering the tracks here-- along with worthy past collaborations like ""Miss Me"" and ""I'm Goin' In""-- it has the potential to be one of those rare dream projects that lives up to its promise. Speaking of Drake, he had this to say about I Am Not a Human Being when talking to MTV recently: ""I think it's just a lotta Wayne songs that... you know, it's just that pre-... it's that pre-... it's that stuff that people wanna hear-- but I think Carter IV is gonna be on another level."" Not really a sticker-ready quote. His hesitation is justified-- this release has neither the conceptual, lasting power of Tha Carter III nor the inspired spontaneity of Wayne's best mixtapes. And since it was recorded before such a traumatic, life-changing event, it's likely to serve more as a clearinghouse than an indication of what's to come. In one of the more lucid moments in the must-see documentary The Carter, Wayne-- then 25-- looks into his crystal ball and says, ""[When I'm] 28, 29 you'll be lookin' for a Lil Wayne album to be full of rap-- the best rap. Full of singin'-- the best songs, not the best singin'. Full of music. Not just whatever you look for now."" Wayne has already done better versions of almost every song on I Am Not a Human Being, which was released on his 28th birthday last week. It's not exactly what we're looking for now.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14711-i-am-not-a-human-being/,"Cash Money,Universal Motown,Young Money Entertainment",2010.0
251,Soundgarden,Telephantasm,Rock,5.0,October 4 2010,David Raposa,Contributor,"Unlike a fair number of their PacNW peers, Soundgarden suffered through some growing pains. The problem wasn't so much that the band was trying to find its own voice, but that Chris Cornell wasn't always sure how to best utilize his. Cornell's apocalyptic shriek is the sort of weapon of mass destruction that needs to be implemented with care and precision. Letting it run free on the sludgy metal-punk of ""All Your Lies"" or faking the funk on a cover of the Ohio Players' ""Fopp"" were baby steps. And yet, getting to hear songs like these-- and, more importantly, to hear the band hit its stride on ""Hunted Down"" (from the Screaming Life EP) or ""Beyond the Wheel"" (from their first full-length, Ultramega OK)-- alongside the alt-rock standards, is a big part of the hook for Telephantasm. This new career-spanning collection comes in a few packages-- the woefully skint single-disc version that will be packaged with copies of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, the collector-baiting 2xCD/DVD/3xLP/book-and-pictures version, and a 2xCD version that serves as a somewhat serviceable overview of Soundgarden's career. For most people, the one to consider is the 2xCD version, and if there's one thing it does better than its best-of predecessor (1997's now-deleted A-Sides), it's acknowledging that the band released a fair amount of music before signing with A&M Records. The potential displayed in their early years, coupled with the group's impeccable pedigree-- not many bands can say they released records on both Sub Pop and SST-- made that major-label jump a foregone conclusion. When Soundgarden did issue their A&M debut, 1989's Louder Than Love, they were still trying to figure things out. A track like ""Hands All Over"" has Cornell and friends striking the sort of po-faced martyrs' pose they'd later mock mercilessly, while ""Big Dumb Sex"" (the ""I wanna fuck fuck fuck fuck you"" song) seems to confuse being a parody of overblown cock rock with being the real thing. Group those two tracks with a half-decent live version of the half-decent ""Get on the Snake"" (speaking of cock rock) and a sloppy pre-Badmotorfinger take on ""Room a Thousand Years Wide"", and that's a third of Telephantasm out of the way without much of note happening. Thankfully, the Telephantasm compilers (mostly) get out of their own way when picking what to include from 1991's Badmotorfinger-- they simply run with the album's first four tracks, and it's by far the best stretch of music on Telephantasm's first disc. By now, Kim Thayil's thick yet fluid guitar leads meet up with an equally heavy and flexible rhythm section to create a menacing backdrop that's perfect for Cornell's ungodly holler. Even better, Cornell's learned that the nuclear option works just as well as an implied threat-- and that makes his shriek that much more effective when it's let off the leash. On tracks like ""Outshined"" and ""Jesus Christ Pose"", Soundgarden figured out how to balance their messianic metallic tendencies with both a sizable helping of self-awareness and a fondness for off-kilter time signatures. The addition of bassist Ben Shepherd gave the group both a strong foundation and an off-kilter songwriting voice to add to the mix. Alas, Telephantasm aims to bait fans by including a live version of ""Jesus Christ Pose"" instead of the album cut-- a pattern repeated too often on Disc Two, which (aside from the group's contribution to the Singles soundtrack, ""Birth Ritual"") covers Soundgarden's final two albums. 1994's Superunknown is, of course, the record that transformed the group into alt-rock superstars, so of course ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman"" are here. Two of the album's other singles, the surf-flavored ""My Wave"" and the fittingly pessimistic ""Fell on Black Days"", are also in the mix, though ""Black Days"" is represented by its lesser video-edit version. Down on the Upside-- Superunknown's gentler and more unfocused sibling-- has both of its most notable singles (""Pretty Noose"", ""Blow Up the Outside World"") repped by live versions, the former represented by its performance on ""Saturday Night Live"", a venue infamous for making almost every musical performer that's graced its stage sound like ass. Also here is the album version of ""Burden in My Hand"" and ""Dusty"", an unremarkable album track that gave their final record its title. Finally, as with every career-spanning compilation looking to make a buck, there's the rare or unreleased track: Where A-Sides offered an import B-side (""Bleed Together""), Telephantasm unearths a Badmotorfinger outtake, ""Black Rain"", which sounds exactly like... a Badmotorfinger outtake. Even if you're not specifically on one of the group's many wavelengths, there's plenty to enjoy on Telephantasm-- fans whose tastes lean towards heavier stuff might find something to like in the Badmotorfinger tracks, while folks whose rock sensibilities are more melodic can dip their toes in the Superunknown. That said, for one extra dollar, curious iTunes shoppers can bypass the middle man and just buy copies of Badmotorfinger and Superunknown-- those albums' deep cuts are much better than most of the tunes on Telephantasm, and you'll get studio singles rather than cut-rate bootlegs. Telephantasm was an opportunity to redefine Soundgarden's somewhat disparate career: to better illustrate the stylistic throughlines that connect Screaming Life to Down on the Upside; to take cuts from their neglected albums and place them in a more forgiving context; to breathe new life into well-known singles. It's a trick the band itself managed to turn with its first post-reunion gig. Performing as Nudedragons, the group took the stage at the Showbox in Seattle this past April and played a set that showed as much love to Louder Than Love and Ultramega OK as any other album in their catalog, giving each portion of their career equal respect without resorting to simply playing just the hits. Succeeding at this sort of task is easier said than done, but it would've been nice if Telephantasm at least tried.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14706-telephantasm/,A&M,2010.0
252,David Bowie,Station to Station [Deluxe Edition],Rock,9.5,September 29 2010,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"When rock stars do too much cocaine, they tend to do ridiculous things, like drive cars into motel swimming pools, or hire hit men to snuff out their bassist, or make Be Here Now. David Bowie, on the other hand, produced Station to Station, an album he allegedly doesn't remember making, but which, ironically, stands as his most immaculately constructed album, and the most important tactical transition in a career built upon aesthetic reinvention. Arriving in the wake of 1975's glam-rock-shunning, Philly-soul-fetishizing Young Americans, Station to Station offered proof that Bowie's fascination with American funk and disco was no one-off lark. But if Young Americans often felt like a studied genre exercise, Station to Station filtered that rhythmic influence through some of Bowie's other obsessions at the time: the austere Krautrock of Neu! and Kraftwerk, the occult, Nazism, and, yes, a whole lotta blow. And yet, for all the tales of late-night black-majick ceremonies and Hitler-salute scandals that surrounded its release, perhaps the most bizarre thing about Station to Station is that an album of such sinister orgin would turn out to be Bowie's highest charting album ever in the U.S., peaking at No. 3. By the mid-70s, it was customary for pop stars to sing of their disillusionment with fame (see: John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, Neil Young's On the Beach) but they usually did so in an insular, introspective fashion, after they had gained some distance from the storm. By contrast, Station to Station finds Bowie expressing his weariness while the party was still rages on around him; even in the midst of his ""Golden Years"", he's yearning to ""run for the shadows."" In essence, the album is a cry for help from the champagne room: On the hymn-like piano-ballad ""Word on a Wing"", the career chameleon decries this ""age of grand illusion"" (tellingly, this LP's Thin White Duke persona would be the last character Bowie introduced), while the title track's momentous prog-disco suite-- with references to Aleister Crowley and Kabbalism-- charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening. ""It's not the side effects of the cocaine,"" Bowie declares as the song hits its funky, 4/4 stride, ""I'm thinking that it must be love."" Rarely have delusions been rendered with such grandeur. This repackaged 3xCD Station to Station arrives as part of an ongoing campaign of deluxe Bowie reissues, and this one's primary selling point-- a remastered version cut from the original analog tapes-- should pique the interest of more than just ardent audiophiles. For all its futurist intimations, Station to Station's most integral elements are acoustic-- E Street Band member Roy Bittan's luxuriant piano rolls, drummer Dennis Davis' dexterous grooves, and Bowie's sax-squawking, which meld to glorious, otherworldly effect on ""TVC15"". The new master perfectly mediates between the album's surface elegance and underlying menace. And in lieu of any studio outtakes or rarities, we get a complete, two-disc version of Bowie's famed March '76 Nassau Coliseum concert, a long-time bootleg that also provided bonus-track fodder for Rykodisc's 1991 Station to Station issue. The need for another mid-70s Bowie live album may seem minimal given the relatively recent reissues of David Live (1974) and Stage (1978), but the Nassau concert is a rousing document of the Station to Station-era line-up (with Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye subbing in for Bittan and Stacey Hayden in the place of Earl Slick) eagerly applying its slick, polyrhythmic panache to glam-rock warhorses like ""Suffragette City"" and ""Panic in Detroit"", and compacting ""Life on Mars?"" and ""Five Years"" into Broadway-scaled medleys. In retrospect, the Nassau show represents something of a last lap around the arena for Bowie as the show-stopping, populist entertainer, before he laid his early-70s material to rest for a while and delved into the more experimental terrain of Low, ""Heroes"", and Lodger. To paraphrase another enigmatic pop icon who had a conflicted relationship with stardom: first he took Long Island, then he took Berlin.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/,Virgin,2010.0
253,Miles Davis,Bitches Brew [Legacy Edition],Jazz,9.5,September 10 2010,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"There's a passage in Miles Davis' notorious 1990 autobiography where he's talking about how much quality music he recorded in the mid-to-late 1960s with his current quintet-- the group featuring Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams. ""I made six studio dates with this group in four years,"" he says. ""And there were some live recordings that I guess Columbia will release when they think they can make the most money-- probably after I'm dead."" I can remember chuckling at that line when reading the book the year of its publication, but it would have been difficult to imagine just how extensive and sustained the Miles Davis reissue program would actually be after his death in 1991. The anniversary sets; the complete studio sessions boxes; the boxes collecting the boxes. It goes on and on and every new gift season brings another new offering. And now here's the latest, from a couple of years after the period Davis mentioned: two re-releases of the legendary 1970 2xLP set Bitches Brew. One is a 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition gathering together the original album on one and a quarter CDs, along with studio outtakes, another CD containing a previously unissued set recorded at Tanglewood, in Lenox, Mass., in August 1970, and a DVD containing a previously unissued concert in Copenhagen from November 1969. The other version of the album is part of Columbia's Legacy Edition and contains the first two CDs from the 40th Anniversary set along with the Copenhagen DVD. There's a reason Bitches Brew is getting this kind of treatment, even after the release of the 4xCD Complete Bitches Brew box set 12 years ago. It is, after all, one of the three or four most important albums of Miles Davis' career. And coming nine months after In a Silent Way, it is also one of founding texts of jazz fusion. It's a Big Deal Jazz album that's been tapped as being an essential part of any collection. Which unfortunately is something that tends to obscure the actual music. Putting on Bitches Brew and then straining to [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| hear why it mattered so much is a pretty lousy way to go about enjoying this music. Which is not to say there isn't a lot here to puzzle over and listen for-- the music on Bitches Brew is so variable and hard to pin down it rewards any amount of close listening. But Bitches Brew is also pretty accessible as electric Miles goes, and it's something you can put on and let wash over you for now, figuring out what it means and what everyone was doing later. The first thing that Bitches Brew made clear is that Miles was keenly interested in expanding the idea of what his music could be, and was starting to stretch it way out. The title track runs 26 minutes, which then and now is at the extreme end of what a side of vinyl on an LP can hold; the opening ""Pharaoh's Dance"" also breaks 20 minutes. And these pieces weren't lengthy compositions or single jams, but were assembled by Miles and producer Teo Macero through editing-- unrelated tracks could become one piece through the miracle of the razor blade and magnetic tape. For an improvisatory art form that was founded on the idea collective expression in the present moment, the idea of stitching together pieces into a new whole was radical enough on its own. But Miles was changing his approach in several ways simultaneously as the 1960s came to a close. He was processing his trumpet with echo, working with electric keyboards and electric guitar, adding new percussion colors, experimenting with rock rhythms, doing away with chord changes, and building long tracks from riffs and vamps. And, as the liner notes from Greg Tate included with these sets illustrate, he was hanging out with Betty Davis, who was introducing him to new music, and along the way he had become a fan of Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and James Brown. All of these elements swirled together into a record of brilliant and fascinating contradictions. The psychedelic cover art and long electric jams on the one hand anchor the music in Age of Aquarius, but the connections to earlier jazz tradition and unmoored, floating quality of music also lend it a timeless feel. It sounds very much like a bunch of dudes jamming in the room, but some of the abrupt edits serve as a reminder that it owes a lot to technology. It finds Miles distancing himself from his musical past, but it sounds equally far from the dense abstraction his music would take on a couple of years later, especially in a live setting. It was long and hard to get a handle on, but it was also a huge commercial success. Ultimately, Bitches Brew seems mostly like a single beautiful frame from a jarring film filled with jump-cuts. The amount that Miles Davis' music changed from the early 60s to the early 70s is astonishing. His sound was constantly on the move, and this is what it sounded like on those August days in the studio. The bonus material illustrates just how quickly Davis' music was changing, and how much his music could vary given the context. Three months after Bitches Brew was recorded (but before it was released), he performed in Copenhagen with a five-piece band that included Wayne Shorter. Chick Corea's electric piano aside, the music is acoustic, though several tunes from Bitches Brew are included (the video is exceptional in quality in terms of both sound and image). In this setting, Davis' music sounds like what most people would identify as ""jazz,"" and is less challenging than the cerebral and harmonically complex music he'd made just a few years earlier with his quintet. But by the August 1970 set included with the 40th Anniversary edition, the raging funk maelstrom that would epitomize his live shows in the next four years was on the rails. What a difference nine months made for Miles Davis as 1969 turned into 1970. The two sets sit at opposite ends of the value scale. Listing at about $19, the Legacy Edition seems to me a very good buy-- the original album is a 2xCD set, the outtakes are reasonably interesting, and the Copenhagen DVD is a vital addition to the Davis canon. Also included on the second disc are four tracks edited down for release as 7"" singles, and they are interesting curios good for one play but not much more-- three-minute edits are the opposite of what this music is about. The 40th Anniversary Set, on the other hand, goes for over $100 and is obviously geared toward Davis completists-- for them, it actually delivers pretty well as these sets go, since the 1970 live set is excellent, there are some extra visual goodies, and it's not padded out with a promotional film masquerading as a documentary (it also comes with two 180 gram vinyl discs-- I'll never quite get why someone wants both CD and LP sets.) How much is left in the vault? We'll see, maybe when the album turns 50.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14623-bitches-brew-legacy-edition/,"Sony,Sony",1970.0
254,The Budos Band,The Budos Band III,"Global,Pop/R&B",7.6,August 18 2010,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Predictability is underrated. Just about every band we love eventually undergoes a transformation-- sometimes it excites us, sometimes it pisses us off. And when a band covers the same ground repeatedly on their first few albums, sometimes that's a blessing, especially if what they were doing on their debut was invigorating right out the gate. The Budos Band are one of those groups. Their 2005 debut plied a particularly up-front take on retro funk, one that compacted Afrobeat, Latin soul, and James Brown into brief but highly danceable instrumentals. So did their second album. And so does their third. You could throw The Budos Band III in with the band's previous two LPs-- titled, with a convenient uniformity, The Budos Band and The Budos Band II-- and come up with 32 songs that all sound like they could have been cut in the same session. Fortunately, that theoretical session makes up one of the more ferocious bodies of old-school funk revivalism in the last few years. Maybe it's the stark imagery of their album artwork at play here-- this is their second sleeve in a row featuring a creature name-checked in Five Deadly Venoms-- but the Budos' music often has this undercurrent of cinematic martial artistry to it. They keep everything tight, showing brutal knockout efficiency that thrives on limber call-and-response riffs and unceasing percussive motion. If you're out walking and you throw on a cut like ""Unbroken, Unshaven"" or ""Golden Dunes"" you'll find yourself stepping up your pace to meet it. And then you might find yourself wanting to do something with your hands-- attempting to punch through marble, for instance, or carrying 50-pound jugs of water up six flights of stairs. This is a band so tight and in tune that they've basically become this telepathically-communicating instrumental hydra that ambushes you into moving your body on its terms. It's a fine balance between playing to your strengths and recklessly charging ahead on familiar instinct. A couple of tracks wind up sounding like vague rewrites; ""Nature's Wrath"" in particular has a marked melodic similarity to The Budos Band II highlight ""Origin of Man"". But other times, they come up with something even more interesting when they go back to their idea well. There was an inside-out twist of the Temptations' ""My Girl"" on II that turned a breezy love song into a minor-chord skulk that rode on tension, moodiness, and implicit jealously (hence the new title-- ""His Girl""). Here, they pull the same stunt with ""Reppirt Yad"" (read it backwards), though turning circa-1965 Beatles into weaselly, blade-flashing kingpin theme music makes for a tweak that's both kind of funny and completely badass. Besides, what would you change in a sound like this? Sure, it'd be interesting to hear the Budos push their terse jams further toward the eight-minute mark. And saxophonist Jared Tankel's admission that the band's initial intent was to make a ""psychedelic, doom-rock record"" hints at something stealthily metallic lurking under the surface; imagine these guys adapting their approach to something in the vein of King Crimson's ""Red"" or Hawkwind's ""7 By 7"". (""Black Venom"" is a hell of a hint; once you find out it was partially inspired by and named after Black Sabbath and Venom-- their trumpeter's idea!-- it's almost impossible not to hear the metal in it.) Still, this is one of those cases where you'll like this album if you liked the last one, and for all the same reasons, so long as you're willing to forgive the occasional bout of déjà vu. This album's predictability isn't the same thing as complacency, and if this music catches you unawares, it'll strike you right where you're vulnerable.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14535-the-budos-band-iii/,Daptone,2010.0
255,James Brown,"The Singles, Vol. 9: 1973-1975",Rock,7.7,August 4 2010,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"In the Watergate era and its aftermath, James Brown was like a heavyweight champion fighting blindfolded. When he hit, he hit hard enough to shatter bone: this volume in Hip-O's mail-order series includes three consecutive #1 R&B hits (the murderously heavy, slow funk grooves of ""The Payback"", ""My Thang"", and ""Papa Don't Take No Mess""), and a few other spectacular jams. But when Brown missed, he flailed just as hard. Sometimes he realized it in time. Volume Nine begins with three scheduled-and-canceled singles, including several awkward duets with Lyn Collins (one of them a bizarre Latin version of ""Let It Be Me""). ""I Got a Good Thing (And I Ain't Gonna Let It Go)"" is a pro forma jam with Brown double-tracked-- playing his own Bobby Byrd, effectively, since Byrd had left his revue. The canceled single was replaced by a new recording less than two weeks later: ""Stoned to the Bone"", more casual but distinctly superior, and a solid hit. This period also saw Brown developing a bizarre weakness for scattering his records with overdubbed sound effects and drop-ins. Adding bits of Jesse Jackson's ""I am somebody"" speech to the Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s single ""Same Beat Pt. 1"" was a great idea. Adding a disc jockey announcing ""This is for Atlanta!"" and ""This record is too much!"" all over ""The Payback"" was not-- the familiar mix, without Hank Spann's interjections, was actually a promotional version demanded by radio. Lyn Collins' smoking ""Rock Me Again & Again & Again & Again & Again & Again"" is not so much a duet with Brown as the boss staring over her shoulder and butting in on almost every line, then dumping in some extra sound effects and grafting the first minute of the track on again at the end. It's pretty amazing anyway. Brown was an aging, eccentric king, but he was still the king: ""Funky President (People It's Bad)"" was easily the hottest pop response to the American politics of the 1970s. And then, all of a sudden, disco was king. For the first time in years, R&B was dominated by rhythms way outside Brown's own idiom, and the last four singles here are the sound of Brown hitting the wall. First, there's a sloppy remake of his 1970 breakthrough ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"". That's followed by a halfway-there J.B.'s instrumental that Brown decided to grace with the title (and chant) ""Thank You For Lettin' Me Be Myself, and You Be Yours""-- was he claiming that Sly Stone had ripped him off, or just ripping off Sly Stone? ""Dead On It"" is one of the strangest records Brown ever released: it opens with two beatless minutes of belching synth noises and occasional sour guitar chords, over which the Godfather rambles about how he's not as good as he used to be but demands respect anyway, before finally breaking into a cautious combination of some riffs he'd been flogging for years. Brown almost immediately withdrew it and replaced it with the similar-only-in-name ""Hustle!!! (Dead On It)""-- a carbon copy of Cameroonian musician AndrÃ©-Marie Tala's 1973 record ""Hot Koki"", and a bald-faced attempt to cash in on the success of Van McCoy's ""The Hustle"". It's not a bad piece of music, but it was a thoroughly embarrassing gesture. Over the course of 1975, drummer Jabo Starks, trombonist/arranger Fred Wesley and saxophonist Maceo Parker all quit working with Brown, effectively dissolving his last classic band. He still had dozens of major and minor hits ahead of him, but he'd never again rule R&B the way he had for a decade.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14508-the-singles-vol-9-1973-1975/,Hip-O Select,2010.0
256,The Roots,How I Got Over,Rap,8.1,June 25 2010,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Above everything else that defines them, the Roots are capital-P Professionals. That's why they're perfect for their ""Late Night"" job. They don't fit there because, as critics would say, they're easily digestible; they fit because they're versatile and consistently operate at a high level. They're encyclopedic music scholars who're proud of their chops but don't flash them at the expense of an accessible hook. They never compromise, even though they're refined enough to help set the standards for grown-man class in hip-hop. And it's possible to listen to their last few albums without being reminded they're big-idea concept records, even though their themes leave an impression fairly quickly. So after all the delays and discarded material (whatever happened to that ""Peaches En Regalia"" cover?), How I Got Over has emerged as a particularly efficient album. It's the Roots' shortest (a lean 42 and a half minutes), one of their most lyrically straightforward, and a work of strong stylistic cohesion. A decade's worth of personnel changes notwithstanding, it's clear that this is the same braintrust that made ""The Next Movement"" sound so vibrant 11 years ago; the two most prominent instrumental components remain ?uestlove's in-the-pocket drumming and the Ahmad Jamal/Donny Hathaway resonance of Kamal Gray's keyboards. And on the mic, Black Thought maintains his usual level-headed authority, continuing to come across at his best like a down-to-earth version of Rakim. But what makes How I Got Over work is its sense of purpose. After the jaw-clenching stress rap of their last two excellent Def Jam releases, Game Theory and Rising Down, this record operates as a slow-build mission statement on how to overcome. Everything hinges on the title track, a stirring anthem built from a congas-and-organ backbone that sounds like a funkier, livelier inversion of Steely Dan's ""Do It Again"". As a showcase for Dice Raw and Black Thought's unexpectedly tender singing voices-- as well as the latter MC's ability to elevate simple sentiments with his delivery-- it feels like the group's usual rigorous standards being met. But it isn't exactly an accurate indication of how the album itself turns out sounding. Instead, it's a pivot point, where everything before its halfway-mark appearance is the tunnel and everything afterwards is the light. How I Got Over is sequenced with a distinct idea of mood progression, changing from defeated, malaise-stricken piano-ballad dirges to defiant statements of survival and resilience. Black Thought's tough lamentations on early tracks ""Walk Alone"" and ""Radio Daze"" pick up where the more introspective moments of Rising Down left off. And even if he pushes a few metaphors past the breaking point or coasts on stating the obvious for a line or two, he doesn't suffer from a lack of relatability. Once ""How I Got Over"" breaks through the first half's well-crafted melancholy and transitions into its more resolute second half, the sound shifts from glowing downtempo neo-soul to something more energized. ""Right On"" pits Joanna Newsom's lilting voice and harp against one of the most commanding drum breaks on the album; John Legend is artfully deployed as both a ghostly sample (the cathedral-sized ""Doin' It Again"") and an intense live vocalist (""The Fire""); ""Web 20/20"" upends the minimalist snare-driven charge of its Tipping Point namesake and mutates it into a jury-rigged, elastic-ricochet revamp of snap music. Black Thought ups his mood over the course of things as well, and by the time they reach the record's unlikely final hook-- ""Hustla""'s Auto-Tuned crying-baby-- he's turning struggles into strengths for the sake of his next generation. A lot has been made of the indie rock collaborations on this album, particularly the appearances by Newsom, the Monsters of Folk on ""Dear God 2.0"", and the wordless a cappella chorus from Amber Coffman, Angel Deradoorian, and Haley Dekle of the Dirty Projectors on the intro track ""A Peace of Light"". But their crossover efforts land firmly on the Roots' side of the equation, integrating into their Soulquarian aesthetic instead of nudging them the other way. Meanwhile, the guest MCs do just as much to round out How I Got Over's personality. The recurring satellite members that bolstered the ranks on Rising Down reprise their roles here (an on-fire Dice Raw, the low-key sharpness of Truck North and P.O.R.N., the obligatory show-stealing Peedi Peedi appearance). ""Right On"" and ""Hustla"" make for a couple of good showcases for promising Philly-via-ATL up-and-comer STS, who's molded his semi-drawl into an agile flow. And there's a couple of fine verses from Little Brother's Phonte and some absolute revelations from L.A. phenom Blu, both of whom sound vital even when they spend most of their time describing their anxiety. How I Got Over has its title for a reason. It alludes to the gospel standard popularized by Clara Ward, and has a similarly spiritual-minded cast to it as its namesake's tribute to the power of belief in helping people reach the promised land. Maybe it's not as explicitly religious, but it regularly alludes to some form of higher power, whether it's God or a more secular sense of things that are simply out of civilization's control. And that's the compelling thing about the Roots on this album: They're not afraid to show humility and frustration when confronted with struggle, operating on the same level of humanity as the people who listen to it. For all the Roots' tight professionalism and clockwork consistency, for all their late-night TV exposure and their status as alt-rap icons, they're not superhuman. But the fact that they know this, that they can make a whole album about coming to terms with it-- that makes them powerful.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14386-how-i-got-over/,Def Jam,2010.0
257,Sia,We Are Born,Pop/R&B,6.6,June 18 2010,Liz Colville,,"Originally from Adelaide, Sia Furler moved to the UK in the mid 1990s to launch her career as a downtempo R&B artist, gaining attention first as the voice of Zero 7 and then as a solo artist with the odd hit single. But over 10 years and four studio albums, Furler has slowly moved away from the effervescent ballads associated with songs like Zero 7's ""Destiny"" and her biggest solo hit, 2006's ""Breathe Me"". And according to Furler, We Are Born is the album she's wanted to make since 2006's Colour the Small One. Instead of catering to fans of that slow, sultry earlier work, she's brought in old and new songwriting partners to help her craft a fast-paced, upbeat pop album. Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Ke$ha, Natasha Bedingfield) produced the album, and there are glimpses of his recent work-- specifically Allen's It's Not Me, It's You-- on the record's hits. But there is also a lot of the jangly, beat-led pop of more arena-sized British acts like Keane, perhaps credited to co-writer Dan Carey, who has worked with the likes of Franz Ferdinand, La Roux, and Hot Chip. Those hits-- ""Stop Trying"", ""Clap Your Hands"", ""You've Changed"", ""Bring Night""-- are well-tailored to UK radio and club remixes. (Diplo has already put his stamp on ""Clap Your Hands"".) They also happen to be the best songs on the album. But some move too far away from Sia's wheelhouse: ""Hurting Me Now"" uses the bubbly vocal harmonies and disaffected delivery peculiar to Allen, to the point that it could be an It's Not Me track that didn't make the cut. Many of the songs succeed because the stories sound like Furler's. ""Stop Trying"" has the vocal chants, clap-driven rhythm, and cutesy keyboards of an Alphabeat song, and the chorus-- ""We like you""-- is insistent without being cloying. In her new video for ""Clap Your Hands"", she plays several Jim Henson-inspired neon creatures with Sia heads that dance and chant encouraging lines like, ""Take a chance on romance/ We only get one chance at this."" The music is sunny and more sociable, and it feels driven by the goofy personality that has gradually blossomed out of the brooding vocalist Sia was once pegged to be. A cover of Madonna's ""Oh Father"" is one of few appearances of the lounge-ready music that dominates her other albums. Soft drums and even softer keyboard twinkles decorate Furler's inimitable tone and impressive twist-and-turn phrasing. But the instrumentation is too thin and the melodies are boring, which is also true of the waltzing ""Be Good to Me"" and ""I'm in Here"". All are examples of the old Sia, tucked discreetly into corners of the album. Furler and her team are certainly going for it, but they don't reach for the boisterous electronics of pop stars like Lady Gaga, Ke$ha, and Katy Perry, which would be an unbelievable stretch. Instead, the electric guitar, played by the Strokes' Nick Valensi, is the instrumental linchpin of the album. It appears on many of the strongest tracks, underscoring melodies and driving momentum, and it suits Furler's voice. On ""Big Girl, Little Girl"", it introduces some of Charlotte Hatherley's jerky, acid-tinged rock, and Furler's flirty acrobatics mimic it, turning a catchy song into an infectious one.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14296-we-are-born/,"Jive,Monkey Puzzle",2010.0
258,The Black Keys,Brothers,Rock,7.7,May 19 2010,Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,"When it was announced that Danger Mouse would be working with the Black Keys on their 2008 album,Â Attack & Release, it seemed like a fresh start for a band that had run out of ideas. While DM indeed brought some psychedelic side dishes to Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney's meat-and-potatoes blues-rock table-- a little pan flute here, some spaghetti Western guitar licks there-- Attack & Release had its share of samey-sounding midtempo cuts, suggesting that the duo were content to write variations on the same theme. Subsequent side projects (both worked in Damon Dash's not-disastrous rap-rock experiment Blakroc, and Carney formed Drummer) suggested that they probably felt this creative stagnation, too. As for Auerbach's basically-a-Black-Keys-album solo effort, Keep It Hid: guy's gotta get it out of his system somehow. New challenges, as well as time apart from their main outfit, have served these guys well. Brothers is the loosest they've sounded since 2004's Rubber Factory. The Keys haven't undergone a drastic sonic shift or anything-- at this point, no one is going to mistake them for anyone else, especially if they keep putting out songs like Brothers' first two singles, ""Next Girl"" and ""Tighten Up"". The former is boilerplate Black Keys, complete with a burned-barn riff for a chorus and lyrics about wayward women; the latter, the only Danger Mouse-produced cut on the record, features a whistle-heavy melody that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Attack & Release. But you don't come to the Black Keys for reinvention. Instead, Brothers finds Carney and Auerbach augmenting their sound with some new stylistic tics, suggesting that they might've learned something from working with Danger Mouse. ""Too Afraid to Love You"" feels spooked-out thanks to Auerbach's distanced vocals and some haunted harpsichord, while the Jock Jams beat on ""Howlin' For You"" and ""Black Mud""'s winking nod to CCR's ""Green River"" find the Keys in an uncharacteristically playful mode. Most striking on Brothers is Auerbach's incorporation of falsetto. The man has honed his speaker-blowing howl for so long now, it's genuinely surprising to hear him try another vocal style. Even more surprising is how good he is at it, too: he's controlled and natural on ""Everlasting Light"", vibing with high-pitched restraint and turning the tune into a lo-fi T. Rex stomper, while on penultimate track and Jerry Butler cover ""Never Gonna Give You Up"", he lets loose over a shimmering Motown melody. If there's one thing that keeps Brothers from jumping the gap between a ""very good"" album and a ""great"" album, it's the running time. When it's all said and done, the 15-track set runs almost an hour long, causing one to think that the Keys might have done the best material here a disservice by shoving so much onto one album when they could've easily saved some up for their next release. It makes a skeptical fan like myself wonder if the Keys spent themselves creatively here, and if the next record will just be more back-to-basics trad-blues mediocrity. If the next Black Keys record builds on Brothers, though, they still have some good music ahead of them.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14222-brothers/,Nonesuch,2010.0
259,The Rolling Stones,Exile on Main St. [Deluxe Edition],Rock,10.0,May 19 2010,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"Despite an absence of the band's best-known songs, the sweaty, grimy Exile on Main St. has grown into the Rolling Stones' most universally acclaimed record. Despite dozens of hits, putting together a cohesive album often seemed to be beyond the Stones, tripped up by either manager Allen Klein's publishing-rights parasitism or the band's 1970s hubris. That leaves a catalog in which only Exile is built not on hits but on vibe and: the album's singularly sleazy sound and making-of legend. To create Exile, the band escaped Britain as tax exiles, decamping to a French villa. Paradoxically, the posh surroundings created the band's rawest effort. They were a heroin-ragged band, jamming late into the night with calloused fingers and vocal cords in a stale basement with sweaty walls. So the best thing a remastered reissue of the record can do is not give the production a bath, a shave, and a haircut. Happily, this new cleanup job doesn't Photoshop out the flaws and flubs, with the band's loose performances still presented in all its debauched glory. Of course, like most treasured nuggets of rock history, that story is undermined by pesky facts. In Stones in Exile, the documentary released with this 38th anniversary reissue, producer Jimmy Miller talks about isolating each band member in a different room of the villa to make the impromptu studio work. That's a fitting image for the Rolling Stones at the time-- while the band was musically at its peak, it was in practice at its most fractured, with singer Mick Jagger and bassist Bill Wyman barely involved for the bulk of the recording. The Exile we know and love is actually the hybrid product of two sessions, two bands really: the Keith Richards-led material from Nellcôte shotgun-wed to the Los Angeles gospel dabbling of Jagger and co-conspirator, keyboardist and former Beatles collaborator Billy Preston. In a way though, Jagger's lack of involvement may have been the key to Exile's success (and probably explains his oft-voiced dislike of the record). With Richards at the helm, the record sounds closest to the American roots music the band relentlessly name-dropped. Vocally, Richards' nasal whine fights for space with Jagger more than anywhere else in their history, adding thrillingly imperfect harmonies. The rest of the supporting cast also gets more of the spotlight: the brilliant barrelhouse piano of Nicky Hopkins singlehandedly defines ""Loving Cup"" and ""Torn and Frayed"", Mick Taylor adds counterpoint leads and the toodling bassline of ""Tumbling Dice"", Al Perkins' pedal steel and Bobby Key's sax contributes soul and country cred. But despite his relative absence, Jagger's contributions on the back half of the record give Exile its dramatic arc. Though the album's concept record status has always been somewhat oversold, the plot does chart a rough path from drunken late-night revelry to next-day regret: The last third of the record looks back on the first two-thirds with a wince and a headache. ""I Just Want to See His Face"", ""Let It Loose"", ""Shine a Light""-- there's a profound need for redemption here unique to the Stones, an odd moment of guilt for a band known for consequence-free sexual bluster. As the last complete sentence of the album says, ""you're going to be the death of me."" Unlike the album proper, the bonus tracks are given a clean scrubbing, and it's blatantly obvious in places that Jagger's vocals are circa 2009, not 1972. That added grooming offers the experimental results of an Exile sans Nellcôte-- still a band in the zone, but more Jagger-dominant and sterilized. Still, many of the unreleased songs work: ""Plundered My Soul"", wins on the merits of its falsetto backing vocals, and ""So Divine (Aladdin Story)"" is like a pastiche of Aftermath-era Stones played by an older, saltier band. If allowing Jagger to touch up those vocals was the price to pay to allow Exile receive the tribute it deserves, it's still a bargain. All the same, it's a bit strange to see the Stones, somehow still alive, on the talk show circuit celebrating the product of their darkest years, treating their addictions, tax evasion, and near-breakup as just a colorful set piece on Rolling Stones: The Ride. The true thrill of Exile on Main St. is that it doesn't require all that backstory to be dramatized and Ken Burns-ed-- all the pain, fun, joy, and regret of being the biggest rock band on Earth, kinda loving it and kinda hating it, is right there in the filthy grooves of the record. Oh, what a beautiful buzz.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14264-exile-on-main-st-deluxe-edition/,Interscope,2010.0
260,Laura Marling,I Speak Because I Can,Folk/Country,8.1,April 2 2010,Joshua Love,Contributor,"Reviewing Laura Marling's Mercury Prize-nominated debut album, Alas, I Cannot Swim, in 2008, I worried that the then-18-year-old might too quickly shed the teenage guilelessness that contributed so greatly to the record's appeal. Marling possessed an undeniable knack for writing about young love with directness and authentic feeling, but at times her pseudo-profound poetics suggested the young folkie was in too much of a hurry to be a serious adult. Clearly, I significantly underestimated Laura Marling's capabilities. Her sophomore effort, I Speak Because I Can, finds Marling, still only 20, shrugging off virtually all traces of girlishness and wide-eyed charm, instead delving into darkly elemental, frequently morbid folk. And yet, astonishingly, the expected growing pains never come. To say Marling evinces wisdom beyond her years on I Speak would be a criminal understatement, considering she's created a haunting, fully flowered gem of an album despite being younger than two-thirds of the Jonas Brothers. These are folk-rock songs, but Marling doesn't lazily trade on it like so many other would-be old souls. Instead, like Fairport Convention or Nick Cave or Cat Power, she uses folk as an archetypal form to get at the essential realities of love, sex, heartbreak, and death. Sometimes she does it with heart-stopping quietness, her voice dropping to conversational tones on ""Made by Maid"" and ""What He Wrote"". Just as often, Marling sets herÂ allegories to raucous musical accompaniment, an especially impressive feat considering the calm of her debut. The bluesy jig of opener and first single ""Devil's Spoke"" might elicit a few less-than-ideal comparisons with KT Tunstall, but Marling blows that kind of politely insistent stuff out of the water on the soaring, thunderous ""Rambling Man"" and the gypsy-ish breakdown of ""Alpha Shallows"" (which makes up for that song's momentary slip into sub-Dylan poetic doggerel). It would have been all too easy for an album like this, so grimly fixated and coming from someone of such tender age, to be written off as the work of a morose young Romantic. However, Marling seems to have a great deal of self-awareness of her melancholic bent, lightly skewering herself on ""Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)"" for writing an ""epic letter"" to an estranged lover that's ""22 pages front and back/ But it's too good to be used."" And yet, she's not playing dress-up. She's a wholly developed artist in full command of gifts that may not yet be finished arriving.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14075-i-speak-because-i-can/,"Astralwerks,Virgin",2010.0
261,Gorillaz,Plastic Beach,"Electronic,Rock",8.5,March 10 2010,Sean Fennessey,Contributor,"Forget the cartoon characters. Damon Albarn andÂ Jamie Hewlett's animated misfits have always been mainly interesting as a concept, and on much of the third Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach, it feels like Albarn and co. are ditching the idea of writing pop songs a cartoon band might front anyway. The one-time Blur frontman has transcended some of the post-modern artifice of this project, and created the group's most affecting and uniquely inviting album. Joke's over, Gorillaz are real. So why make this a Gorillaz album in the first place? It wasn't meant to be one. Hewlett, the celebrated Tank Girl co-creator, told The Observer last July, ""Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters anymore-- it's more like an organization of people doing new projects."" The project was to be called Carousel, presented by, but not performed by, Gorillaz. It never panned out. So Albarn devised Plastic Beach, a loose enviromental-song cycle warning against disposability. It's a noble conceit, if a transient one. Along with a typically diverse band of collaborators, Albarn dips into Krautrock, funk, and dubstep, as well as the weary, more melodic music he's been perfecting for much of last decade-- sort of an electronic take on baroque pop. Albarn also sounds more comfortable as a leader here than he has in some time. On the standout ""On Melancholy Hill"", he recalls the swooning strains of one of his heroes, Scott Walker. And when he shares or cedes vocals, he has the good sense to turn things over to luminaries like Lou Reed (magnificently dry-throated on ""Some Kind of Nature"") and Bobby Womack (good on first single ""Stylo"", better on the twangy ""Cloud of Unknowing""), while effortlessly integrating them into the sound. Handling most of the production himself, Albarn has reversed the good fortune of the first two Gorillaz albums. With Dan the Automator on their 2001 self-titled debut and Danger Mouse on 2005's Demon Days, the group was adept at fusing giddy pop with hip-hop, inserting De La Soul, Del the Funky Homosapien, or a yippy Miho Hatori into some of their best songs (""Clint Eastwood"", ""Dirty Harry"", ""Feel Good Inc."", ""19-2000""). Those songs crashed in from all places with little mind to sequence or balance, and the result was two fairly unfocused records saved by some decent alt-rap. On Plastic Beach, things are the other way around. The rap moments here feel almost needlessly idiosyncratic amidst the lusher treatments. Snoop Dogg's appearance on ""Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach"" is an incongruous introduction to an album that has nothing to do with Snoop Dogg. De La repeat themselves on the faux jingle ""Superfast Jellyfish"". Grime MCs Kano and Bashy compellingly play pass-the-baton on ""White Flag"", but only after disrupting an absorbing intro and outro by the Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. Only on ""Sweepstakes"" is Mos Def able to assimilate into the production. Albarn is more natural when working in the kind of ornate Village Green Preservation Society-style pop that dominates Plastic Beach. His collaborations with Little Dragon, ""Empire Ants"" and ""To Binge"" are two of the most arresting things here-- they're airy, elusive, and amazingly beautiful. It's been years since Albarn has written anything as blatantly gorgeous. If he had to work past the animated pretense to rediscover it, all the better. Why be a cartoon when you can be a real person?",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14008-plastic-beach/,Virgin,2010.0
262,Johnny Cash,American Recordings VI: Ain't No Grave,Folk/Country,5.7,February 25 2010,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Johnny Cash recorded most of the tracks for the fifth and sixth installments of his American Recordings series between his wife June Carter Cash's death in May 2003 and his own just four months later. He was in poor health, and the effects of Shy-Drager syndrome prevented him from working most days. But when he felt up to it, he recorded; when he felt too weak, he wished he were recording. The able-bodied A Hundred Highways, released in 2006, was the first product of all that working and wishing, and Ain't No Grave is now the second. It doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know about Cash in his final months, nor does it sound like an attempt to re-brand an icon or re-shape a legacy. Instead, it plays like a desperate means of keeping Cash alive just a little longer. As such, it may say more about producer Rick Rubin, who has guided this series for 16 years, than it does about Cash himself. Rubin comes across as deeply sentimental and fashions Ain't No Grave-- rumored to be the final installment in the series-- as a tearjerker. Listen as Cash ponders the delicate seam separating life from death on his own arrangement of ""I Corinthians 15:55"". Listen as he reminisces sweetly about life and love on Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"". Listen as he realizes he has a long past and little future on Tom Paxton's ""Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound"". It can be manipulative and obvious: Just the title of ""I Don't Hurt Anymore"" looms ominously on the tracklist. Cash's weak but determined performance aside, it's meant as a beyond-the-grave pronouncement, a consolation from the afterlife. The song itself was never about heaven. It's about numbness as a salve for heartache, so in this context it feels like a great tune that cannot carry such a heavy conceptual burden. Between that and all the other tracks about mortality, Ain't No Grave has the feel of a séance-- morose and possibly even staged. And yet, we want to believe. We want Cash to go out on top, with a strong batch of songs created in the interval between hardship and grace. Even so, it's hard not to question some of the choices made in assembling and arranging these new songs. The album begins with its two clumsiest tracks: Cash's vocal is strong on the title track, weaker on Sheryl Crow's ""Redemption Day"", and here's where Rubin shows his influence over the project. He overloads both with goth-country instrumentation meant to recall ""The Man Comes Around"" and ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"", but the nail-in-coffin percussion, the eerie organ, and the blues guitar playing through an old radio all sound like clichés by now. The Old Testament ambience has lost its impact, contrasting sharply with the hands-off approach that defined the first and still best American Recordings album. When Rubin leaves the fire and brimstone behind, Ain't No Grave picks up considerably, revealing itself as a personal rather than preacherly album. Even in those final days, when his spirit was strong but his voice weak, Cash remained a charismatic and commanding singer, with an easy gravity and a friendly, grandfatherly presence. He draws out the long syllables and sustained vowels of Bob Nolan's ""Cool Water"" gracefully and even joyfully, and sounds particularly invigorated on Joe ""Red"" Hayes and Jack Rhodes' ""A Satisfied Mind"" (given the relative robustness of his voice, the track actually seems like it's from a different session altogether). And of course, it wouldn't be a final American Recordings album without a weepy send-off. No one, not even Cash, could pull off Ed McCurdy's ""Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream"" without sounding sappy, and Queen Lili'uokalani's ""Aloha Oe"" is the studiously unsentimental sentimental send-off we all knew was coming. Ain't No Grave isn't really Cash's farewell as much as it is Rubin's memorial mixtape.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13938-american-recordings-vi-aint-no-grave/,American,2010.0
263,Mumford & Sons,Sigh No More,Rock,2.1,February 19 2010,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"That band name derives from singer/guitarist Marcus Mumford, but the band members aren't actually his sons. Rather, it's a play at quaint family businesses run by real people in real small towns, trades passed down through generations: both independent (yes, as in indie) and commercial. It's a shallow cry of authenticity, but this West London quartet really does sound more like a business than a band, supplying value-added products at discount prices. Their debut, Sigh No More, is stocked with group harmonies straight from the Fleet Foxes warehouse, exaggerated earnestness on consignment from the Avett Brothers, some of the same rock ""real""-ness that built the Kings of Leon brand, second-hand drama from that run on Keane a few years ago, and some insistent Gomez rusticisms gathering dust in the back room. It's not spot-the-influence if they're pushing them on you with a salesman's insistence. Mumford & Sons take an emporium approach, with an inventory that's broad but never deep. By spreading their attention around so many different trends, they aim to do many things adequately-- perhaps to distract you from an inability to do any one thing especially well. They love big moments and acoustic instruments, so you might call what they do hoedown pop, although that might be giving them too much credit: Every hoedown on Sigh No More-- every rush of instruments in rhythmic and melodic lockstep-- conveys the same sense of hollow, self-aggrandizing drama. And they pull that shit on every track. Among the predictable crescendos, there are some unexpected textures, mostly courtesy of some guy calling himself Country Winston playing banjo and dobro. And they contain hints of Celtic melodies in songs like ""Roll Away Your Stone"" and ""Thistle & Weeds"", like they might be trying to update Fairport Convention and Pentangle. But none of these ideas is fully developed or explored, the gestures fleeting at best. For music that ostensibly prizes the appearance of honesty and confession, Sigh No More sounds surprisingly anonymous, giving a sense of the band as engaged music listeners but not as real people. Mumford paints himself a sensitive guy put upon by insensitive lovers: ""Tell me now where was my fault in loving you with my whole heart,"" he whines on ""White Blank Page"", as the music swells and ebbs to exonerate him of any misdeed or misunderstanding. Worse is ""Little Lion Man"", which is already a hit in Britain but sounds overly self-absorbed in its insistent mea culpas, as if admitting wrongdoing is a noble gesture: ""I really fucked it up this time, didn't I, my dear?"" When Mumford & Sons stray from their tales of romantic martyrdom, the results are actually worse. Late in the album, ""Dust Bowl Dance"" kicks up some American Gothic ambience with what sounds like the least believable stab at a murder ballad ever set to record. ""I'll go out back and I'll get my gun,"" Mumford sings, like a man who had never handled a firearm in his life. ""I said, 'You haven't met me, I am the only son.'"" When the Sons' electric guitars finally kick in, the song descends from ill-advised to downright embarrassing. Live, it's probably their closer, but ""Dust Bowl Dance"" hints that Mumford & Sons are in the costume business. They're playing dress-up in threadbare clothes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13906-sigh-no-more/,Glassnote,2010.0
264,Lil Wayne,Rebirth,Rap,4.5,February 4 2010,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"It could be worse. ""Everybody say they just do it, well, I just don't,"" claims Lil Wayne on Rebirth, his unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album. And he's speaking the truth: This album is not the logical official follow-up to 2008's best-selling Tha Carter III. At all. In any way. For that, he deserves credit. Considering Wayne is a man whose artistic aims apparently involve 1) Collecting oil-tycoon cash, 2) Having sex with several women at once, and 3) Concocting the world's finest excrement-related rhymes, Rebirth is most definitely a flop, terribly unsexy, and contains surprisingly few shit jokes. Wayne is playing against type here. ""When I play sick, I'm Jordan with the flu,"" he boasts on the album, referring to Jordan's classic game against the Jazz. And in general, that's true; but here Wayne is like Mike with pneumonia and a broken leg... playing baseball. In the mid 1980s, Run-D.M.C. used distorted guitars and stadium-rock drums to help break hip-hop into the mainstream. Now, one of the world's biggest rappers is using the same tools to make a niche record only a diehard could truly love. That flip says as much about hip-hop's current state of evolution (shaky) as it does about Lil Wayne's current commercial predicament. Although his recent mixtape was dubbed No Ceilings, the pressure of success and the idea that he'll never top the million-in-a-week phenomenon that was Tha Carter III is naturally weighing on Wayne. He may never have a single as big as ""Lollipop"" or reach the level of universal relevancy to warrant another prime time interview with Katie Couric. He seems to realize this on Rebirth. ""Call me crazy, I've been called worse/ It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?"" asks Wayne on ""Paradice"", a Miltonian epic about the trappings of super stardom that aims for Axl Rose, Use Your Illusion-style heights. The closest he comes to an answer to that question is on ""Drop the World"", where he combats paranoia by threatening to ""pick the world up and drop it on your fuckin' head!"" It's a hilarious image that would serve as an incredible exaggerated parody of Linkin Park angst if the song wasn't dead serious-- a fact confirmed by a martyr-me guest shot from Eminem, who himself still sounds like he's coming to grips with the fact that he'll never be as famous as he once was. ""Drop the World"" also contains another key lyric from Wayne: ""The spot get smaller and I get bigger/ Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga."" The lines hint at the notion of Rebirth being something of a cop-out, i.e., if he can't top himself, he's just going to scratch away everything that makes him great. So instead of rapping we get gurgled Auto-Tune chirps and squeals that often nullify his one-in-a-billion elastic croak. Instead of next-level clever punchlines-inside-of-punchlines we get pure high-school inanity or swear parades deserving of a soapy mouthwash. According to Wayne, rock music combines the coked-out idiocy of Sunset Strip hair metal with the processed rage of Bizkit-ed headbanging. Understandably, the combination can be abhorrent. The choice to cannibalize two of rock's least respectable styles against each other makes zero sense, and is especially surprising from someone obsessed with André 3000, whose similarly risky 2003 genre switch up, The Love Below, wisely borrowed from Prince more than Evanescence. But even with Rebirth's crushing lows-- and Wayne's imminent jail sentence thanks to a guilty plea on attempted gun possession charges-- there is little reason to doubt the 27-year-old's future as an enterprising, Grammy-highlighting superstar of the most esteemed set. ""Confidence is the stain they can't wipe off,"" he says on the record, and he's right. A big part of his magnetism relies on unpredictability and his willingness to reside in a personal realm where trends, gimmicks, and gravity are of little concern. In that more ideological and less critical mindset, Rebirth is an oddball win. His still-impressive productivity rate also cushions the blow-- thanks to No Ceilings, we know the guy's rapping abilities are still sharp. And, on the same day Rebirth saw release, Wayne also put out a brand new non-album cut called ""Fuck Today"" that combines rap and rock with more aplomb than anything on the new LP. The track is diabolical and political, recalling Ice Cube in his early-90s prime. And it makes you think the proposition of a Rebirth II might not be so awful. I mean, it could be better.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/,"Cash Money,Universal Motown,Young Money Entertainment",2010.0
265,James Brown,"The Singles, Vol. 8: 1972-1973",Rock,8.4,January 5 2010,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"In the early 1970s, James Brown wanted more badly than ever to be important. He re-entered the political arena on the wrong foot, pissing off his fan base by endorsing Richard Nixon for president in 1972; he tried to get in on Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield's blaxploitation-soundtracking action, putting together music for Black Caesar and Slaughter's Big Rip-Off. He attempted to position himself as a crossover-minded mainstream entertainer, as a hardcore funk iconoclast, as an anti-drug humanitarian, and as a swinging party dude, all at the same time. Amazingly, he got away with most of it, and oversaw an expanding business at the same time-- People Records, a showcase for members of his revue, had recently launched. (Brown's name was plastered all over every People label's singles.) It helped that, as usual, even some of his moves that looked terrible on their face worked out just fine. Anyone else would have thought twice about releasing a dramatic reading, with strings, of a poem about heroin written by a waiter at the Godfather's favorite deli. (""King Heroin"" became a massive hit.) It also wasn't an obvious gesture to cover the ""5"" Royales' ""Think"" with a slick New York studio crew rather than his touring band in 1973-- especially since he'd already covered it as a single three times in the 60s-- or to pair it with a scenery-chewing soul version of the Beatles' ""Something"". (Shortly thereafter, he re-recorded his vocal for ""Think"", this time beginning with a little spiel about ""Soul Train"", and released it again as his next single; it hit the charts both times.) And it definitely seemed like a bad idea to bring saxophonist and former bandleader Maceo Parker back into his band without telling the rest of the group before they showed up at the recording studio, to release the result under his trombonist's name rather than his own, and to give its two parts separate titles that appear nowhere in its lyrics rather than naming it after the hook. ""Doing It to Death"", credited to Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s and released on People, became a #1 R&B single anyway. The one musical desire Brown still couldn't gratify was his longing for another ballad on the order of ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"", which had been in his set for eight years (and would stay there for the rest of his life). ""Mama's Dead"" and the ghastly two-part ""Woman"" are both lugubrious rewrites of the real thing; ""Nothing Beats a Try But a Fail"" never even made it to the racks. The hard funk masterpieces, on the other hand, still flowed freely. ""There It Is"" is one of the hottest tracks he ever cut, a jubilant piece of cross-chatter whose fraction-of-a-second silences are like splashes of cold water. ""Get on the Good Foot"", ""I Got a Bag of My Own"", a jubilant strut through Bill Doggett's ""Honky Tonk"", the perfectly titled ""I Got Ants in My Pants (And I Want to Dance)"": the man was on a roll. Well, the man and his band, rather. Trombonist/bandleader Fred Wesley had been Brown's secret weapon for a while; by 1973, he was practically the co-star, the guy in charge of translating the boss's grunts and whims into hits. The soundtrack numbers on this set's second disc obviously bear his imprint, and even beyond ""Doing It to Death"", Wesley and the J.B.'s get off a bunch of great, slinky funk singles under their own name. Soul Brother #1 chants along for most of them, and even sits in on drums for a not-bad-at-all instrumental cover of Herbie Hancock's ""Watermelon Man"". Brown was starting to recapitulate his past hits more and more (""Sexy, Sexy, Sexy"", a substantial 1973 hit, is a note-for-note reprise of 1966's ""Money Won't Change You""), but for at least a few more years, his group's momentum was still pulling him into the future.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13774-the-singles-vol-8-1972-1973/,Hip-O Select,2009.0
266,The Doors,Live in New York,Rock,7.0,November 20 2009,Chris Dahlen,,"So I'm 13, and I'm slouching through Harvard Square on my way to get Pink Floyd boots at the used record store. I'm just starting to grow my hair long-- which never really worked out-- and I'm wearing a grey t-shirt sporting the hundred-yard-stare of Jim Morrison of the Doors. From across the street, a guy three times my age shouts: ""Fuck! Yeah! The Doors!"" And for that moment, we are brothers. *The Kids in the Hall'*s Bruce McCulloch argued that Doors fans are born, not made. But he ducks the question of why we're not making them anymore. Today, one of the first standard-bearers of rock is less hip than Journey. Let's review the case against the band: First we have Morrison himself, who's been blown into a caricature by his super-sexual persona, his wifty poetry, and his early death in a Paris bathtub. The music sounds like a weird cross between shit-kicking blues-rock and brain-spraining acid-jams, and it's easier to get your avant-garage fix from the Velvet Underground, your rock shaman verse from Patti Smith (or not at all), or your psychedelic extravagance from countless Nuggets bands. As dead 1960s rockers go, Jimi's legacy has left Janis and Jim in the dust. It may be a strange way to put it, but the problem with the Doors is that they were not efficient. Let's say that's where you are with this band. So here's how this set might change your mind. Rhino has reissued all four sets from their gig at the Felt Forum in January 1970, right before the release of Morrison Hotel-- and still in the shadow of Morrison's drunken, obnoxious, and allegedly obscene performance in Miami, which threatened him with jail time. Many tracks from these shows have been released before, but on this box you can listen to them bootleg-style, with all the repeated songs, tuning breaks, and banter with the audience. The Live in New York set sounds like an unedited performance, but in fact, the tapes had been so worked-over for other live albums that the team had to meticulously reconstruct it from 8-track and 2-track source tapes, using fan tapes as reference. Guest John Sebastian's harmonica wasn't even captured in the original mix; producer Bruce Botnick brought him back to the studio this year to replay the solos, based on what they got from tape bleed. Why go to the trouble? Because this is the truth. It's what the Doors sounded like, without the heavy hand of an Oliver Stone looking for the juicy parts-- and without the impatience of the iPod generation trying to trim it down. As you listen to the set, Morrison doesn't come off as a self-absorbed mystic: He's far more like the troubled kid in school who couldn't sit still and didn't fear anything. He demands and rewards attention. He's petulant with the audience, even barking at them or pleading to ""give the singer some"" when they won't stop talking. The vibe from the crowd may explain why the fourth show starts rough: After scolding the crowd, Morrison sounds disengaged or mocking as he wanders through the first few songs. But then he suddenly rewards the audience with a rare performance of his rock suite/poetry slam, ""Celebration of the Lizard"". The piece isn't exactly a lost classic-- it's not his most powerful verse, and musically it doesn't gel like ""The End""-- but the best thing about this recording is how into it Morrison gets, from the quiet couplets to the screams. It's easy to see how people fell in love with the poet no matter the poetry, although some of his verse is still dangerous: The ""Horse Latitudes"" poem that he interjects in ""Moonlight Drive"" boasts his strongest imagery, and the contrast between that and the seaside groove is still striking. The rest of the band is here to support the star, and it never lets him down: The Doors were a loose, groovy, and ferocious combo, here playing a setlist that sticks to rock and blues and skips all the winsome and folky stuff that cluttered up Waiting for the Sun and The Soft Parade. Organist Ray Manzarek played the hooks that turned songs like ""Hello, I Love You"" into pop hits, but here he's focused on driving the rhythm section. Even his legendary solo on ""Light My Fire"" changes in concert from a melodic improvisation to a jam that climaxes in frustration, as you can hear him stabbing the keys with all ten fingers and wishing he had another ten besides. On the other hand, guitarist Robby Krieger is ferocious right from the riff of ""Roadhouse Blues"", and he makes their cover of Bo Diddley's ""Who Do You Love"" one of the best recordings the Doors ever made. History hates this band for its excess, but so what? The Doors thrived on excess. When Morrison gears up the crowd with his groin and his ego and roars, ""gonna have a re-al, good time,"" no excess, no overdose, no scream is big enough for the good time he's got in mind. And that's the way to remember him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13721-live-in-new-york/,Rhino,2009.0
267,David Bowie,Space Oddity [40th Anniversary Edition],Rock,6.7,November 17 2009,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Through the 1970s, David Bowie built his legend on a parade of changing persona and shrewd stylistic shifts. But his initial, late-1960s forays into the music industry illustrate that there's a fine line between ""chameleonic"" and ""indecisive""-- in his early years, Bowie tried make his name variously as a mod bluesman, a traditional folksinger, an Anthony Newley-schooled theatrical raconteur and, on his 1967 self-titled debut, a music-hall dandy. Ironically, it was a song seemingly most susceptible to a brief, novelty-tune shelf life that would prove to be his first enduring work: the 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", which, of course, riffed on the similarly titled Stanley Kubrick blockbuster of the day, and was fortuitously timed to court a space-crazed populace still abuzz from that summer's lunar landing. The ploy didn't quite pay off-- though the ""Space Oddity"" single cracked the UK Top 5, the sophomore album on which it appeared flopped, as the efforts to establish the David Bowie brand resulted in a confusing release strategy. His UK label, Phillips, issued the album in Britain as David Bowie (making it his second self-titled album), while his U.S. benefactors at Mercury christened it with a title that begged to have it relegated to the folk-section cut-out bin: Man of Words/Man of Music. But rather than prompt another career about-face, the album's prog-folk hymnals (complete with guest keyboard wizardry from Rick Wakeman of Yes) helped point the way to the artful glam-rock that would make Bowie a superstar-- upon which he would reissue the album in 1972 and rename it after its most famous song. As such, this 40th-anniversary reissue of Space Oddity does not so much commemorate a great album-- it doesn't even rank among Bowie's 10 best-- but rather the true first chapter in an often brilliant career (not to mention the dawn of Bowie's fruitful collaborative relationship with producer Tony Visconti). Tellingly, the title track has opened pretty much every Bowie greatest-hits compilation of note, and rightfully so-- not only does its still-thrilling rocket-launch structure anticipate Bowie's own supernova ascent, the song's themes of splendid isolation and uncertain futurism would prove ever-present motifs in his work up through 1980's Scary Monsters. But if the song dramatically reinvents Bowie as a sci-fi folkie-- serving as the middle-man between late-60s hippie idealism and early-70s disillusionment-- with few exceptions, the rest of Space Oddity isn't quite as eager to thrust forth into the great unknown. Instead, we hear a young dude who's still back home with his Beatles and his Stones (see: the perfunctory ""Hey Jude"" group-chorus coda of ""Memory of a Free Festival"" for the former; the extended blues boogie of ""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed"" for the latter), with a well-worn copy of Love's Forever Changes close at hand-- all that's missing from the mellotronic psych-folk serenade ""An Occasional Dream"" is an Arthur Lee co-write credit. So amid these stately surroundings, side-one closer ""Cygnet Committee"" stands out not just by virtue of its nine-minute length, but for its strident disavowal of hippie platitudes (""[we] stoned the poor on slogans such as 'Wish you could hear!' 'Love is all we need!' 'Kick out the jams!' 'Kick out your mother!'""); likewise, Bowie's voice overpowers the song's languid folk-rock sway as if it were a shackle, introducing his signature technique of intensifying and accelerating his delivery to break free of the verses' pre-established cadences. It's the birth of the classic David Bowie Affectation-- the one that's been embraced/lampooned by everyone from the Frogs and Ween and Destroyer to Flight of the Conchords-- making ""Cygnet Committee"" as important a breakthrough for Bowie as Space Oddity's more celebrated title track. Comparatively, Space Oddity's other epic set pieces-- the over-orchestrated fable ""The Wild-Eyed Boy From Freecloud"" and hippie-dream requiem ""Memory of a Free Festival""-- are too baroque in their presentation to fully transcend the status of time-capsule curios. But they're still historically significant for introducing Bowie's future foil Mick Ronson, who makes an uncredited appearance on the former, while contributing some six-string muscle to the improved, two-part single version of ""Free Festival"", included on this set's 15-track bonus disc. A handful of these rarities have surfaced previously-- namely on the 1989 Sound+Vision box set, the 1990 CD reissue of Space Oddity and the 2000 Bowie on the Beeb radio-sessions compilation-- and the set feels excessively padded with (not-so) alternate mixes. But taken together, they illuminate the rapidity of Bowie's evolution between the album's conception and its promotion, from an embryonic demo version of ""Space Oddity"" (sung in a higher register and different meter) to the superior, stripped-down versions of ""An Occasional Dream"" and ""Freecloud"", the Marc Bolan-backed single version of eventual Aladdin Sane track ""The Prettiest Star"" and the proto-Spiders From Mars swagger of ""London Bye Ta-Ta"". And throughout it all, Bowie even found the time to learn another language, cutting a lyrically revised Italian version of ""Space Oddity"" (""Ragazza Solo, Ragazza Sola"") to compete with a wave of successful cover versions in Italy. It 's hardly the most flattering portrait of a man who would go on to sell the world, but still a quaint keepsake from a time when he was just trying to blag his way through mainland Europe.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13610-space-oddity-40th-anniversary-edition/,EMI,2009.0
268,Lil Wayne,No Ceilings,Rap,7.7,November 16 2009,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"No Ceilings. Nice title. Nice concept, too. Here's Wayne explaining it, on one of his new mixtape's blessedly few skits: ""I would love for you to look up into the building and understand that there is no ceilings; there is only the sky."" And in his case, it's true; Wayne's potential greatness seems to have no limit-- or if it does have a limit, it's difficult to say what it might be. Wayne's tough to evaluate because he's so very rarely operating at peak capacity. Whereas a classically great rapper (Ready to Die-era Biggie, say) might hammer his concepts straight on until he's bludgeoned them into atoms, Wayne barely ever has any concepts, hopscotching frantically but lazily between ideas and chasing digressions down gopher holes. Wayne's digressive, distracted spirit is a huge part of what makes him great; even at his Carter II peak, he was always slippery and unpredictable and defiantly weird. But ever since he indisputably became the most popular rapper in the world last year, he's been in a strange zone, trusting his instincts to the point where he's now preparing to drop a whole album of somebody's idea of rock on us. And his instincts are, more often than not, bad. Add that to his purportedly staggering drug use and his upcoming prison sentence, and it's tough to tell just how far he could fall. Wayne's got no ceilings, but he's got no floors either. And given the increasingly scattered nature of his post-Carter III work, the existence of No Ceilings is just a tremendous relief. After last year's wildly disappointing Dedication 3, Wayne's finally back to something like his Dedication 2/Drought 3 fighting shape and doing what he does best, swiping beats from all the songs on rap radio and rendering the originals obsolete. Pity F.L.Y. and Dorrough after what Wayne did to ""Swag Surfin'"" and ""Ice Cream Paint Job"". Beats like those are where Wayne traditionally comes off best; those cheap, tense, springy synthetic tracks make Wayne's berserk rasp sound something like catharsis. Wayne's got no compunctions about snatching up a middling regional dance-rap mini-hit, and that appetite serves him well. When you throw him on something busier and bigger-budget like Jay-Z's ""D.O.A."" or ""Run This Town"", he doesn't sound quite as at home. So it's fortunate that Wayne still has a bug up his ass about Jay. On those two tracks, he just goes absolutely ripshit, throwing slick subliminals at Jay or just laughing Jay's barbs off. At least on mixtapes, Wayne doesn't have Jay's drive to build eternal monuments to his own importance; he's free to just spazz out. So, on ""Run This Town"": ""New Orleans Coroner, his name is Frank Minyard/ Fuck with me wrong, you'll be waking up in his yard."" (A Google search confirms that New Orleans' Coroner is indeed named Frank Minyard. Wayne: Backing up his insane threats with verifiable facts!) In some intriguing ways, the rise of Gucci Mane presents an interesting challenge to this sort of Wayne mixtape. Gucci represents an evolution of Wayne's free-associative style, one simultaneously spacier and more focused. Gucci has none of Wayne's cursory desire for acceptance from NY true-schoolers, and he favors the kind of dinky, catchy budget beats that Wayne loves stealing on tapes like these. Wayne raps over three Gucci tracks on No Ceilings, as well as one from Gucci associate Waka Flocka, but he doesn't treat these tracks like challenges the way he does with the Jay songs. He probably should, since the Gucci songs are the rare mixtape tracks where Wayne can't erase the memory of the originals. And No Ceilings certainly has its problems. Wayne might never again sound as flat-out committed as he did on Dedication 2. His punchlines don't always carry the same impact, and he's more likely to laugh at his own jokes. He shares valuable mic time with tolerable nonentities like Lucci Lou and Gudda Gudda. He picks a few tracks like the Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling"", songs that just aren't conducive to great rapping. He swipes a few terrible sex-rap tracks and makes slightly less terrible sex-rap tracks out of them, though even those will dependably include a few appealingly loony lines (""I get it wetter than bass pussy"" is supposed to be seductive?). He's not quite the animal he was. But No Ceilings once again finds Wayne in total control of beats, motivated and sliding freely between ideas. He pronounces ""alps"" and ""stealth"" and ""milf"" like they all rhyme with each other. He's scatological: ""I'm on some shit ain't even been out the ass yet."" He's haughty: ""Elevator in my crib cause it's five floors/ I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours."" He's on his half-sensical pop culture shit: ""I get big chips; you get Alvins."" He's capable of coming up with lines that get stuck in your head for no conceivable reason: ""I'm flyer than the highest flying bird around this ho."" He's frankly disgusting: ""I made the pussy gleek."" And with the twin trials of prison and Rebirth looming, it's just enormously gratifying to hear that he still knows how to rap, that he loves doing it. After all, nobody does it like him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13672-no-ceilings/,Young Money Entertainment,2009.0
269,The Rolling Stones,Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert [40th Anniversary Deluxe Box Set],Rock,5.4,November 13 2009,Joshua Love,Contributor,"If the Rolling Stones really were the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band for the better part of the 1960s and 70s, then surely somewhere along the line they must've released one of the great live albums of all time too, right? This rationale is the only way I can account for the fact that the Stones' best-regarded live release, 1970's definitely pleasurable but less-than-transcendent Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, routinely places highly on lists of the best concert documents in rock history. It feels like the kind of perfunctory acknowledgment that virtually all of the other typically high-ranking sets (for instance, Neil Young's Live Rust, the Who's Live at Leeds, and the Allman Brothers Band's At Fillmore East) don't need, seeing as how they're genuinely awesome. Live performance never seemed as intrinsic to the Rolling Stones' essence as it did for most of 60s and 70s rock's other heavy hitters. Sure, as soon as playing basketball arenas became a viable rock-star option the always-avaricious Stones rushed to embrace the financial potentialities, but the group's music never cultivated the kind of epic, transformative breadth that best fills an enormous space like Madison Square Garden, where Ya-Ya's was recorded. Big venues demand that everything else be larger than life as well, but outsized song lengths (think the Grateful Dead, Allmans, Led Zep), outsized emotions (the Who, U2), and outsized spectacle (KISS, David Bowie) have never been indispensable components of the Stones' music. It's not for nothing that some of the band's most cherished officially sanctioned live work happens to be the El Mocambo club stuff from 1977's Love You Live as well as 1995's intimate Stripped. Nonetheless, Ya-Ya's persists as the Stones' go-to concert recording, so it's hardly a surprise to see the band now putting out a deluxe, 3xCD/DVD reissue of the two-night event. Unfortunately, as a purchasable product, this $60-retailing set ($41.99 on Amazon) is damn near felonious. Disc One is the original album itself, remastered, though keep in mind it was already given the SACD treatment in 2002. Disc Two is a grand total of five tracks-- recordings of the tracks the Stones played those two nights that didn't make the album proper. Disc Three is material from opening acts B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner, and ironically enough it may the part of the box that's most worth getting excited about-- particularly the devastating way Tina digs into Otis Redding's classic ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"". Disc Four is a DVD, which seems pretty enticing until you realize it only captures performances of the same five songs that were on Disc Two. Why, at the very least, a disc couldn't have been assembled that put the songs in the order in which they were actually originally played is beyond me. Now, by denigrating this Ya-Ya's reissue as a commodity and by questioning the album's canonization in general, I don't mean to imply this set doesn't cook. Even if it's not larded with 20-minute workouts, Ya-Ya's is manna for guitar freaks, thanks to the fiery interplay between the immortal Keith Richards and inarguably the greatest lead guitarist the Stones ever boasted, Mick Taylor. ""Under My Thumb"" and ""Live with Me"" feature wondrously rejiggered riffs, while ""Love in Vain"", ""Street Fighting Man"", and ""Sympathy for the Devil"" soar with brilliant solos (two solos in the case of ""Sympathy""). Rhythmically, the whole set (aside from a two-song acoustic blues interlude) coagulates into one long, sweaty, irresistible throb. All that said, the fault for Ya-Ya's falling just short of the Pantheon must then lie at the feet of Mick Jagger. In the studio, Jagger has always had time and takes to work a wealth of subtle ironic nuances into his readings, but Madison Square Garden isn't the place for nuance. As the Stones became less sexy and stylish in the 80s, Jagger's routine grew more goofily athletic, and the gigantic football stadiums the band preferred were perfect conduits for his crowd-pleasing mugging and gymnastics. In 1969, however, image and venue failed to mesh, and Jagger just seems to lack fire and imagination, aside from lasciviously dropping the age of the sexually uncaged teenage girl in ""Stray Cat Blues"" from Beggars Banquet's 15 to the Roman Polanski-approved 13. For the most part, however, Jagger fails to recognize that this was the band's moment, and that unawareness of Ya-Ya's epochal promise is the primary thing that keeps the album from truly belonging alongside the preeminent aural snapshots in rock history.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13675-get-yer-ya-yas-out-the-rolling-stones-in-concert-40th-anniversary-deluxe-box-set/,ABKCO,2009.0
270,Nirvana,Bleach [Deluxe Edition],Rock,8.5,November 11 2009,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"The line between cool and uncool has never been less defined: We live in a world where Hall and Oates have become as influential to emergent indie-rockers as Joy Division, and Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"" has become as much of a hipster-bar last-call anthem as ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"". And yet, even in an era of omnivorous musical consumption and boundless genre tourism, the sight of a computerized Kurt Cobain belting out Bon Jovi's ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" in a recent Guitar Hero 5 demo reel was enough to revert the good/bad taste divide back to 1988 borders. For Nirvana fans, the Guitar Hero scandal was more than just a case of a dead rock-star's visage being exploited for the sake of peddling product. Few artists treated record collections as an extension of personal politics quite like Cobain; having him sing a hair-metal hit is not just contrary to his musical taste, but his entire value system. (Though one can't help but wonder what a guy who once skewered alpha-male behavior in a song called ""Mr. Moustache"" would make of indie's current facial-hair fetish.) And yet, Cobain was no stranger himself to challenging accepted notions of cool. When it first emerged 20 years ago, Nirvana's debut album, Bleach, represented an equally heretical notion to some indie aesthetes: Flipper-grade sludge-punk molded into Beatles-schooled pop schematics. By 1989, indie rock was already making a rightward shift across the radio dial-- Dinosaur Jr. had covered Peter Frampton, the Butthole Surfers were dropping in not-too-subtle Black Sabbath and Zeppelin references-- but rather than using post-hardcore noise to desecrate their traditional FM-radio influences, Nirvana used it to give their dinosaur rock more teeth. In Cobain, they had a frontman with uncommonly melodic instincts, but shot through a voice that sounded like it was coughing up blood; in Krist Novoselic, a bassist who could hit the heretofore untapped sweet spot between Paul McCartney and the Melvins. But unlike most rock bands who divided pop history between before and after, Nirvana's impact was not immediate. Upon its release, Bleach was a modest indie rock success at 40,000 copies sold, and the album's low-budget legend-- it was recorded for a scant $600, footed by the band's temporary second guitarist, Jason Everman-- often overshadows the music within. At that point, Nirvana had yet to divest itself of its Pete Best: drummer Chad Channing, whose scrappy style wasn't fully suited to the band's growing propensity for crater-inducing stompers. (Three Bleach tracks-- ""Floyd the Barber"", ""Paper Cuts"", and ""Downer""-- were actually helmed by Melvins thud-master Dale Crover, and you can really tell.) And the album's first single-- a cover of 1960s Dutch-popsters Shocking Blue's ""Love Buzz""-- is more emblematic of the dementoid new wave that Nirvana would indulge in on their future B-sides than the metallic Pixies-punk that would turn them into stars. But rather than unfairly compare it to the platinum sheen of sophomore release Nevermind, Bleach is best appreciated today as a snapshot of a specific time and place, of a Seattle scene bubbling up before it turned into a media adjective: In the Aero Zeppelin grind of ""School"" and the Mudhoney-quoting scum-bucket thrash of ""Negative Creep"", you have the perfect audio manifestation of the stark, exhilarating black-and-white Charles Peterson photos that captured late-80s Seattle like a series of strobe-light flickers (and which populate much of this reissue's 52-page photo booklet). Original producer Jack Endino's new remastering job gives Bleach a much-needed boost in fidelity, but there's an intrinsic, primordial murkiness to this album that can't be polished-- while Axl was welcoming the masses into the Sunset Strip jungle, Nirvana dragged the Sub Pop set into the bleak, chilly backwoods from which they came. Though briskly paced, Bleach is a front-loaded record, the maniacal/melodic contrasts of its stellar first half-- anchored by the epochal anti-love song ""About a Girl""-- ceding to the more period-typical grunge of its second. The bonus live performance included here (recorded in 1990 at Portland's Pine Street Theater) suggests as much, mostly ignoring Bleach's side B to showcase important transitional tracks: the scabrous pop of ""Sappy"" (later to emerge as ""Verse Chorus Verse"" on the 1993 No Alternativecompilation); ""Dive"", a blueprint for Nevermind's plutonium-grade rockers; and ""Been a Son"", which bears the influence of Cobain's beloved Vaselines (whose ""Molly's Lips"" is covered here). It's a testament to both Endino's live-in-the-room production style and Nirvana's raucous onstage energy that Bleach and the bonus concert set sound like they were cut in the same session. But the concert also presents Nirvana in a light that the band's subsequently troubled and tragic story so rarely affords them: a simple, playful power trio who could lay waste to a drunk club crowd on a Saturday night. Two years and one Dave Grohl later, the circumstances couldn't have been more different for Nirvana. Amid rumors of Kurt'n'Courtney drug problems and inter-band acrimony, the trio took to the stage for their headlining Sunday-night appearance at the Reading Festival, effectively cementing their status as the biggest-- and most gossiped about-- rock band in the world. If Bleach contains just trace evidence of the band that would, almost overnight, force radio stations to flip formats and record stores to open up ""alternative"" sections, the Live at Reading CD/DVD provides formidable evidence of perhaps the last rock'n'roll band to transform the monoculture in its own image. And yet, despite Cobain's cheeky show-biz entrance-- rolled onto stage in a wheelchair by music journalist Everett True, singing a line from Bette Midler's ""The Rose"", and then mock-collapsing-- the Reading set shows a band that hadn't changed all that much fundamentally from that Pine Street Theater gig two years previous. Cobain's newly acquired, generational spokesmen duties didn't make him any more fond of engaging the audience with stage banter, ceding emcee duties to the jovial Novoselic during guitar changes. And even when playing to the biggest audience of their career, Nirvana blast through the 25-song setlist with a barrel-down, no-bullshit intensity that suggests it didn't matter if they were playing to 100 people or 100,000. And most pertinently, both concerts capture the band at crucial, between-album turning points: where the Pine Street Theater set shows a band burnishing its pop appeal, Live at Reading betrays Cobain's eagerness to tear it down, dispensing with the obvious Nevermind hits by the mid-set point, while reserving the encores for seething covers of 80s California punks Fang's suitably sardonic ""The Money Will Roll Right In"" and the Wipers' ""D-7"". In retrospect, the concert crystallizes the moment when Cobain stopped serving his servants and started serving himself, pointing the way to 1993's notoriously caustic In Utero. Given its long-standing popularity as a bootleg, you can't help but wonder why Live at Reading wasn't officially released back in the mid-90s instead of the live compilation From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah; certainly, Reading makes for a more appropriate, electrified complement to the band's other career-defining performance, 1994's Unplugged in New York release. And for the sake of squeezing the entire set (save for ""Love Buzz"") on a single disc, the Reading CD excises pretty much all of the DVD's between-song interactions (most notably, the goof on Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"" that precedes the similarly riffed ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"") and key contextual interludes that reveal the tumult leading up to this triumphant performance (e.g., a heartfelt plea from Cobain to have the crowd shout a conciliatory ""We love you Courtney"" in the wake of her receiving the Yoko treatment from the British tabloids). But the CD's career-spanning tracklist-- touching on the best of Bleach, most of Nevermind, choice singles and B-sides (""Sliver"", ""Aneurysm""), three In Utero previews (""Tourette's"", ""Dumb"", ""All Apologies""), and the aforementioned covers-- actually makes it a far superior, more comprehensive introduction for Nirvana newbies than the band's 2002 greatest-hits compilation. Like the Who's Live at Leeds or Cheap Trick's At Budokan, it's an indispensible document of a legendary band at their most invincible. And even if you're the sort of Nirvana die-hard who's been sitting on an audio bootleg of this gig for the past 17 years,you really need the DVD-- for a band whose visual legacy mostly amounts to a handful of stylized videos and the lowkey Unplugged special, Live at Reading effectively grants you side-stage access to the band in their mosh-pit-stoking, drum-set-toppling prime, putting you as close to the action as the band's mysterious friend Tony, who's seen flailing onstage throughout the show like an epilpetic Bez. Like the Bleach reissue, the Live at Reading packaging is heavy on photos and other scrapbook visuals, but entirely bereft of liner-note reminiscences and analysis-- because lord knows we don't need another essay-length rumination about Nirvana's cultural import and Cobain's conflicted relationship with stardom. The most lasting images on the Live at Reading DVD-- from the 60,000-strong pogo pit, to the blood sprayed on Cobain's pick guard at set's end, to the awkward but poignant post-show meeting with a young, leukemia-stricken fan-- tell you everything you need to know.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13686-bleach-deluxe-edition-live-at-reading/,"Sub Pop,Interscope",2009.0
271,Isaac Hayes,Shaft OST [Deluxe Edition],Pop/R&B,8.5,November 2 2009,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"It's not often that a musician gets a chance to initiate a massive shift in two different fields of entertainment at the same time. Things were different before Isaac Hayes made the leap to scoring movies: you had your Beatles vehicles and your concert documentaries, your ripped-from-the-charts soundtracks (Easy Rider) and your film scores that became pop hits (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). But there was nothing quite like the convergence of popular and cinematic music in Shaft, at least not since Duke Ellington was tapped to soundtrack Anatomy of a Murder 12 years previous. With Shaft, Hayes didn't just break through with a #1 pop album, #1 pop single, and Academy Award, he changed the musical directions of Hollywood and R&B simultaneously. Within two years, damn near everybody in soul had a soundtrack in their discography, resulting in career-defining classics (Curtis Mayfield's Super Fly) as well as creative transitional experiments (Marvin Gaye's Trouble Man). And it hit hard in the other direction, too: by 1973, Bruce Lee and James Bond alike were busting heads to Lalo Schifrin and George Martin scores that threw in the same serpentine wah-wahs and supple funk percussion that nabbed Hayes his Oscar. And yet most people have a hard time looking past that first song. For all the ""baaaad mother--/ Shut yo' mouth"" rapport and whocka-chicka style that provoked a thousand deconstructions of 1970s attitude, ""Theme from Shaft"" was an intricate overture doubling as a character-establishing theme that made a title card all but redundant, and it proves how easy Hayes' transition from songwriter to film-score composer actually was. The liner notes to Stax's new, remastered Deluxe Edition reissue of the Shaft soundtrack make note of Hayes' previous foray into the field (the semi-obscure Norman Mailer film Maidstone) and the advisement of jazz composer Tom McIntosh to ""just do your thing"" instead of worrying about taking cues from the score to an epic like Doctor Zhivago. But despite his non-traditional approach-- The Isaac Hayes Movement was said to have recorded ""headwise,"" without the use of sheet music-- Hayes reached an ideal midpoint between film scoring convention and R&B auteurism, and Shaft is full of cinematic cues and motifs that came naturally to a musician who'd already pushed the boundaries of symphonic soul two years before on Hot Buttered Soul. The majority of Shaft is instrumental, with lots of incidental music that runs between a minute to four and change; it's best experienced in the original filmic context but still has a certain appeal on its own. Aside from being a rich vein of sample material (the agitated cricket-chirp guitars in ""Walk From Regio's"" and the simmering, brassy strut of ""No Name Bar"" being two of the richest), these tracks are also an illuminating cross-section of what Hayes and his musicians-- the Bar-Kays, the Movement, and the Memphis Strings & Horns-- were capable of. The Hammond-driven ""Bumpy's Lament"" is the most distinctive nod to Stax as it existed in both the mid 60s and the early 70s, combining the grittiness of gospel roots with opulent strings and flutes. ""Ellie's Love Theme"" and ""Shaft Strikes Again"" take it even further, grafting Burt Bacharach/Hal David light-pop melodies into the mix to add an undercurrent of upscale sophistication. And the nods to jazz (the Wes Montgomery-esque guitars in ""CafÃ© Regio's"") and blues (""Bumpy's Blues"", one flying-V and raspy-smooth drawl away from being an Albert King single) were, if anything, emblematic of how versatile the Stax/Enterprise ""house style"" had actually become. There are still a couple moments of Isaac Hayes as we know him in a more traditional, non-cinematic sense, even though one of them isn't just montage-ready but a sort of montage in itself. ""Soulsville"" is one of the quintessential 70s slice-of-life-as-protest songs, and while its travelogue-style breakdown of ghetto strife is a now-familiar theme, it's also clearly written as an entreaty for otherwise-oblivious whites to sympathize with Black America's troubles (""The chains that bind him are hard to see/ Unless you take this walk with me""), and its mournful sax might be the most iconic moment outside the title theme. Then there's Hayes as marathon runner: the simmering funk of ""Do Your Thing"" takes vamping to a staggering extent, starting with a slinky backbone and working its way into a manic, wailing-guitar frenzy that seems calculated to top the already-intense climax of Hayes' own ""Walk on By"". It's that rare 19 1/2-minute song that's so propulsive and energetic that it goes by like it's five, though the band does get so exhaustively thorough with wringing every last drop of sweat and power out of its groove that eventually one of the guitarists just starts riffing off the three-note NBC theme for no apparent reason. (Left on the CD/digital version: the sudden, hilariously meta ""fuck it, we're out of time"" needle-scratch ending.) Within a couple of years of Shaft, Hayes had become so much of a soundtrack celebrity that it briefly threatened to eclipse his other work, and by 1974's Tough Guys and Truck Turner he was able to knock out an entire album's worth of soundtrack-ready funk so easily that he had more than enough time to star in the movies themselves. But while his music never really regressed-- Truck Turner, soundtrack or no, might be his best album of the 70s-- Shaft is where Hayes' meteoric popularity peaked. And for damn good reason: he created a theme song that was both ubiquitous and game-changing. But, as the liner notes reveal, it was the last thing he wrote for the score-- making it a song whose strengths were simply the culmination of an already extensive and finely-crafted soundtrack.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13629-shaft-ost-deluxe-edition/,"Stax,Stax",1971.0
272,Devendra Banhart,What Will We Be,Folk/Country,4.0,October 30 2009,Grayson Currin,Contributor,"Within one five-month span during 2004, Devendra Banhart-- a hirsute, multilingual, 23-year-old enigma with a wanderer's tale to tell and a sprawling, intriguing debut to his name-- released two 16-song albums: the near-flawless Rejoicing in the Hands and its less cohesive though memorable follow-up, Niño Rojo. He sang about human fragility and little yellow spiders, about old folk songs and with old folk singers, about the beauty of beards and the wealth of the world. With a versatile warble and a graceful touch to the guitar, Banhart seemed slightly manic yet strangely endearing, the rare eccentric who could turn the lightest of larks into irresistible bits of tunes. That winter, the magazine Harp likened him to Van Morrison, John Lennon, and Jeff Buckley, saying he possessed ""a deeper connection to the cosmos than most of us share."" By year's end, Banhart had emerged as the preeminent songwriter and personality of what was generally dubbed New Weird America, or freak-folk. He was bound, it seemed, for some bigger glory. Banhart pursued that career in the most expected fashion: In 2005, he left Young God Records and Michael Gira, the small independent label and producer that had served as his guide, for XL, an international imprint of the label group that controls 4AD, Matador, and Rough Trade. Two subsequently guest-heavy records followed and looked to expand beyond those fundamental early works. Disjointed psychedelia concerned with seahorses, nothing tunes about Chinese children, smeared ballads about the war, the Beatles, and the slow burn of memory: Altogether inconsistent but often interesting, those albums seemed to find Banhart pursuing a global vernacular he'd yet to define. His audience grew, certainly, but, with these experiments, real fame still seemed beyond his grasp. He began dating a Hollywood starlet, hired Neil Young's manager, Elliot Roberts, and landed a big-time booking agent. A spotty supergroup with some friends and a New York rockstar followed, as did a bit role in a teenage romance and songs doled out to soundtracks and commercials. And, earlier this year, he signed to Reprise Records, home to Young, among many others-- a platform, it would seem, for [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| that bigger glory. So one might assume that now is the time for Banhart to complete that cliché ascendance-- to make a levelheaded album of straightforward songs that stands a chance of selling. Well, maybe next time... At first glance, What Will We Be-- Banhart's sixth album and his first for Reprise-- does feel a bit like the kind of record that might break him to an audience on the right side of an FM dial or using WiFi at Starbucks. ""16th & Valencia, Roxy Music"", after all, is an agile, escapist folk-disco rave about ""ridin' six white horses"" and ""free dancin'."" ""Rats"" is a Led Zeppelin-baiting anthem with a midsection about, again, dancing, kissing, and general merriment. And from the bright-eyed opener ""Can't Help But Smiling"" through the whispered, pale country boogie of ""Goin Back"", the album's first quarter offers a rather sunny, upbeat initiation. Banhart's writing seems normalized, too: ""Love is the only thing truly worth needing,"" he posits at one point. ""Every kiss that we miss is another life we don't live,"" at another. Love, drinks, drugs, colloquialisms, creation myths: What Will We Be could be a great big common lawn for aged hippies, album-rock veterans, and college-rock kids alike. But across its 14 tracks and 50 minutes, What Will We Be again sounds like Banhart's attempt to prove he can take risks and sound interesting without his acoustic guitar. A mess of scrambled styles that ostracizes more often than it charms, at least one-third of this record plays like a batch of covers cribbed from one of those Putamayo world-music collections at Whole Foods. ""Angelika"" veers left from its Brazilian-cum-bluegrass lilt to show it can samba and Banhart can twist and yowl in Spanish. ""Foolin'"" splices reggae with the Beatles and succeeds in sounding just slightly less milquetoast than Eric Clapton's turn at island music. Meanwhile, first single ""Baby"" gets goofy about romance (which makes you say ""holy moly"" and feel like a bow-tied kangaroo, apparently) over a flimsy highlife trot. And every time Banhart lands something genuinely agreeable, he finds a way to hamstring it: ""Walilamdzi"", one of the most wistful tunes in Banhart's catalog, is a simple fingerpicked reverie. Sung in the mostly lost language of Northern California's Pit River Indians, though, it comes with an inherently off-putting defense. And it's not enough that ""The First Song for B"" is the latest in a series of sublime Banhart piano ballads. No, it meanders into the acoustic morass ""The Last Song for B"", where Banhart listlessly intones, ""A movement/ Attunement/ A new dream/ Beyond dream."" Who knew it was so easy to sound more vague than Akron/Family? In 2004, Banhart sang, ""It's like finding home in an old folk song/ That you've never ever heard/ Still you know every word/ And, for sure, you can sing along."" And that's how those early records felt-- familiar yet foreign, as if Banhart had found and reshaped something we didn't know we'd lost. Favorable reviews of What Will We Be will likely toss off adjectives like multicultural or eclectic and epithets like polyglot or plunderer. ""He's only exploring,"" they'll say. But Banhart's third album of unhinged stylistic exploration feels more like a reach than a quest-- a timid attempt to distract with a grab bag of forms rather than to engage any one idea with vigor and innovation. We're left with songs afraid to stake interesting artistic claims (""Goin Back"" puts the Flying Burrito Brothers in an autoclave) or defend them (see the needlessly circuitous ""Chin Chin & Muck Muck"") for very long. More focused on offering Banhart's international and oddball bona fides than crafting songs that feel at all like home, What Will We Be finds Banhart in need of direction and editing. Or, as Banhart sings on that awful dance tune of his, ""We don't know what to do."" Here's hoping that, someday soon, he may figure it out.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13645-what-will-we-be/,Warner Bros.,2009.0
273,Pearl Jam,Backspacer,Rock,4.6,September 22 2009,Joshua Love,Contributor,"If you're between the ages of, say, 25 and 35, chances are you either significantly overrate or underrate Pearl Jam. Either you carry a certain nostalgist's sentiment for one of your early rock touchstones (I fall into this camp), or you view them as the root of all that was overwrought and evil about mid-to-late-90s guitar music. Sure, everyone knows PJ sold eleven trillion albums between 1991 and '94, but still I imagine it's difficult for relative young'uns to reconcile how strong an opinion so many people in a specific demographic have about a group that hasn't been commercially or critically relevant for over a decade. Backspacer, the group's ninth studio album, seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster. Virtually the whole record settles into the same formula the band's been dutifully churning out since the dawn of the millennium-- lively but almost utterly hookless riff-driven hard rock. Lather, rinse, repeat. And when I say ""riff-driven"" I really mean ""almost entirely riff-dependent,"" because musically the riffs themselves are typically the only things worth your attention. PJ's long-dormant punk and hardcore proclivities (ugh, ""Lukin"") have been rising to the surface with greater regularity in recent years, and I'll admit in short bursts this bulldozing approach can be somewhat satisfying. The opening four songs kick-start and then keep up a certain pleasing level of propulsiveness, with the goofily fast-and-loose ""Gonna See My Friend"" (hey, is that an actual bassline I hear?) and Thin Lizzy-ish double entendres of ""Johnny Guitar"" being particularly listenable. Sooner or later, however, you remember these guys wouldn't know a melody if it bit them in the ass. What's worse, this chugging blitzkrieg negates the power of the band's greatest weapon, Eddie Vedder's voice, which can display its craggy richness and masculine grace only when the band isn't trying to break land-speed records. (I know some folks hate Ed's singing, but it mostly seems like they're reacting to the fact that his voice launched a thousand Nickelbacks, which is like hating ""The Simpsons"" because of ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad"".) The gentle ""Just Breathe"" might seem like the perfect opportunity for Vedder to finally dust off those resonant pipes, but instead he sings the tune with a distractingly country-ish catch in his voice, plus the tune is numbingly syrupy and the lyrics, after a promisingly pointed start (""I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love"") devolve into tedium. The same hit-or-miss sensitivity marks ""The End""-- Vedder inexplicably finds it necessary to remind us he's ""just a human being"" on one song and ""just another human being"" on the other-- but at least ""The End"" manages to land on the right side of affecting thanks to its painfully honest depiction of romantic dissolution (""This is not me/ You see/ Believe/ I'm better than this/ Don't leave""). Still, we have to rely on ""Amongst the Waves"" to deliver anything remotely resembling the soaring anthemics that used to be a PJ trademark (what I wouldn't give for a ""Light Years"" even). The back half of the album sure isn't inclined to help, largely abandoning even the modest steamrolling enjoyment of the record's initial jolt in favor of thoroughly forgettable mid-tempo dreck, save for ""Supersonic"", which nonetheless sounds like a band trying to be the Ramones minus the fun. It's an extremely odd thing to say about a band that for three or four years was the biggest rock megalith on the planet, but nowadays Pearl Jam are the very definition of anonymously workmanlike, seemingly plugging along with their heads down from one colorlessly unimaginative album to the next. Once upon a time this was a group that was on top of the world and yet still took all kinds of bizarre chances, recording shit like lengthy tape experiments and songs about bugs-- often ridiculously self-indulgent, sure, yet always surprising. Now, paradoxically, with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13480-backspacer/,"Interscope,Monkeywrench",2009.0
274,The Beatles,Past Masters,Rock,9.2,September 10 2009,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"Past Masters is the ugly but brilliant sibling of the Beatles discography. Originally released as two separate discs in 1988, it's a catchall for all the stuff the Beatles officially released during their existence that wasn't intended for their albums (and didn't end up on the after-the-fact album Magical Mystery Tour). It's slapped together chronologically, so it begins with an unprepossessing alternate take of ""Love Me Do"" and ends with the ludicrous doodle ""You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)"". And, between them, it includes some of the best pop songs ever recorded-- scratch that: some of the best pop singles ever recorded. It can be hard to grasp the way it used to work if you've grown up with the basic unit of pop music as the album or the individual song, but the model the Beatles grew up with-- and arguably broke-- was the 45 RPM single: two songs sold together, one of them aspiring to popular success and the other one a sort of lagniappe. They treated their own singles not just as hit-plus-filler but as an often-complementary pair: the massive humanist crescendo of ""Hey Jude"" paired with the corrective political fireball of ""Revolution"", the frantic urgency of ""Paperback Writer"" paired with the dreamy involution of ""Rain"", John Lennon's bitter, betrayed ""Day Tripper"" paired with Paul McCartney's hopeful, clear-eyed ""We Can Work It Out"". For that matter, their singles weren't simply teasers for an album: Of the 22 singles (and two EPs) the Beatles released in the UK between 1962 and 1970, more than half weren't initially part of a bigger unit. Their first non-album single, ""From Me to You"", came out all of three weeks after Please Please Me; ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" emerged a week after With the Beatles. ""Day Tripper""/""We Can Work It Out"" was actually released-- as a double A-side-- the same day as Rubber Soul, on which neither side appeared. By that point, they were basically just showing off. Most of the first disc of Past Masters is the product the Beatles were being pushed to crank out over the first three years of their recording career: The three-covers-and-a-leftover Long Tall Sally EP, German recordings of a couple of hits, a version of Larry Williams' ""Bad Boy"" that filled out an American LP. It also features the two phenomenal, headlong late 1963 singles that transformed them from a perfectly nice Liverpool band to The Goddamn Beatles: ""She Loves You"" and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". It's a testament to the Beatles' gamechanging originality that the opportunistic American bands who tried to make a few bucks by covering those songs over the following few months couldn't even play them right-- the harmonies of ""She Loves You"" and the delicious rhythmic trick that introduces ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" flummoxed every one of them. The astonishing stuff continues on the second disc: seven A-side/B-side pairs, plus an alternate version of John's devotional ""Across the Universe"". ""Paperback Writer""/""Rain"" was the single where they moved away from their great subject of love, and where Ringo Starr perfected his uncanny ability to shift the beat just enough that the band seemed to be hovering a few inches above the ground. George Harrison's ""The Inner Light""-- a spaced-out setting from the Tao Te Ching, on which he's backed up by Indian musicians-- is a momentum-killer in the context of an album (as it is here), but it made sense as part of a yin-and-yang pair with Paul's earthy Fats Domino homage ""Lady Madonna"". ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"", rushed out seven weeks after ""Get Back"", looked like a colossal act of vanity on its surface-- John messing with the Lennon/McCartney copyright juggernaut by reporting so literally on what he'd been up to for the past couple of months that the result was basically impossible to cover, and getting Paul into the studio to bang it out with him, even though Ringo and George were due back in town just a few days later. It's a triumph, anyway. As usual with their singles, there's something new and ear-catching jumping out of the speakers every few seconds (the shaker that doubles the rhythm right after the bridge, Paul's improvised-sounding last-word-of-each-line harmonies, John singing ""Gibraltar near Spain"" at a moment when that was a political assertion), and honestly Lennon had been having a pretty interesting spring. And then there's their biggest-selling single and deepest pairing of songs, ""Hey Jude""/""Revolution"". McCartney is singing about Lennon's son, Lennon is shouting about the system and culture about which they're embedded; ""Jude"" wraps its arms around the world and gets everyone to join in its mantra, ""Revolution"" pushes the idiots away with the nastiest noise the Beatles had ever made. It was also the first release on the Beatles' own label, Apple Records-- or, rather, one of two singles that came out the same day. (The other was Mary Hopkin's ""Those Were the Days"", which knocked it off the top of the British charts after a couple of weeks.) As a seven-minute song on an album of three-minute songs, ""Hey Jude"" inevitably overpowers its context; as a free-floating sound file without ""Revolution"", it's missing the sting that tempers its sweetness. But if you find yourself taking advantage of the reissue-and-""Rock Band"" frenzy to sit down and really listen to the magnificent recordings that have spent the last four decades or so as inescapable background music, remember the way much of these two discs were meant to be heard and understood: two by two.

275,The Beatles,Let It Be,Rock,9.1,September 10 2009,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"As the 1960s wound down, so did the Beatles. The symmetry was perfect: youthful energy, optimism, and camaraderie had given over to cynicism, discord, and looking out for number one. As the decade's final year began, the White Album was still riding high on the charts and the Yellow Submarine soundtrack was days away from release. But the Beatles were in serious trouble. Nothing about being in the band was enjoyable or easy. The power vacuum left by the death of manager Brian Epstein a year and a half earlier had never been satisfactorily filled; Apple Corps, the multi-media company started by the band a year earlier, was bleeding money; and toughest of all, the once-Fab Four didn't generally enjoy being in the same room together. All were either married or close to it, closing in on 30, and tremendously weary of all they'd been through. Paul McCartney, the most devoted of the gang to the notion of the Beatles (Ringo Starr called him the ""Beatleaholic""), thought that the group needed a special project to bring it together. Another White Album-style scenario, with the songwriters in the band working alone in separate studios, enlisting each other to serve as a de facto backup band, was bound to fail. Too much good will and trust had been lost. They needed something big they could all submit to. Several ideas were proposed, most involving a return of some kind to live performance: perhaps a live album of new songs or a huge show in a remote place; maybe the band would charter an ocean liner and make an album on it. Ultimately, it was decided that the band would be filmed on a soundstage rehearsing for a show and developing material for a new album-- a document of the Beatles at work. The theme for the project would be back-to-basics, a return of the group as a performing unit, sans overdubs, emphasizing their inherent musicality. Working title: Get Back. It was an awful idea. First, no one was sure exactly what he was supposed to be doing. Glyn Johns was there, a new presence behind the boards, but he never quite figured out if he was producing or just engineering. Regular producer George Martin was technically on board, but his participation was minimal. While Let It Be was initially meant to be a return to simplicity, Phil Spector's later involvement (he was brought in to ""reproduce"" the tracks, adding extra voices and instruments to thicken arrangements and remix the record, a decision made without McCartney's input) killed that angle. Organizational chaos aside, the sessions were painful. We all know what it feels like to be around people we don't like for days on end; if reality television has taught us anything, it's that a camera crew in a room full of such people does nothing to ease tension. The time the Beatles spent recording and filming was described by all as supremely unpleasant, despite a later uptick when they'd returned to finish up at Abbey Road. And when they finished, no one really liked what they'd laid down on tape. So not surprisingly, the essential nature of Let It Be is that it feels incomplete and fragmented; it's a difficult album to peg because the Beatles were never sure themselves what they wanted it to be. So the best way to approach it is as a collection of songs by guys who still were churning out classics with some regularity. It may not succeed on the level of the Beatles' previous albums, but there's enough good material to make it a worthy entry in their canon. Outside of the title track, there's little here that feels consequential to the Beatles' legacy. The easy acoustic shuffle of the John Lennon and Paul McCartney duet ""Two of Us"" has appeal, though, as do the prickly rhythmic drive of George Harrison's ""For You Blue"" and the bubbling Booker T-isms of McCartney's ""Get Back"". The swampy ""I've Got a Feeling"", possibly reflecting McCartney's recent interest in Canned Heat, is intriguing because it sounds so classic rock 70s. And Lennon's ""Across the Universe"", recorded during the White Album sessions and sounding like it was beamed in from somewhere else, has a certain ringing brilliance. For balance, there's ""Dig a Pony"" and the boogieing ""One After 909"", the latter actually written by Lennon and McCartney as kids in the fifties. Still, for plenty of good bands, the best of these would be career highlights. Recorded without joy, set aside for months while a better album was assembled, and finally remixed in a way that enraged one of the band's principals, Let It Be finally saw release in May 1970. But by that point, the Beatles break-up had been official for several weeks. There's since been a live album, compilations, digitization, trolls through the archives, and an ocean of ink spilled about this little band that made it very big. And now there are these CD issues, done beautifully. But there never was a proper reunion, and we can assume that there will never be another Beatles.

276,The Beatles,Abbey Road,Rock,10.0,September 10 2009,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"One more ""like we used to"" was how Paul McCartney framed it to producer George Martin; a chance to make a ""good album"" was George Harrison's take. They were hoping to bounce back after the serious downer that had been the Get Back sessions, which, months after they wrapped, had yet to yield an album anyone was happy with. But what ""like we used to"" meant, exactly, was rather hard to pin down: The Beatles' life as a band was so compressed, with such a massive amount of music and change packed into a short time, that there was never a single moment that could be used as a reference point for what a Beatles record was supposed to be. So when they returned to the EMI studios on Abbey Road in summer 1969, it wasn't clear how it would go. They still weren't getting along; their musical interests continued to diverge; John Lennon didn't really want to continue with the Beatles; Paul McCartney did, but on his own terms, which meant that he set the pace and got what he wanted. Though it was unspoken, they all had a good idea that this could really be the end. So what now? One more, then. And what a finish. The Beatles' story is so enduring in part because it was wrapped up so perfectly. Abbey Road shows a band still clearly in its prime, capable of songwriting and recording feats other groups could only envy. Working for the first time exclusively on an eight-track tape machine, their mastery of the studio was undeniable, and Abbey Road still sounds fresh and exciting 40 years on (indeed, of the 2009 remasters, the improvements and sonic detail here are the most striking). Even if it's ultimately the Paul McCartney and George Martin show, as demonstrated on the famous second-side medley, everyone brought his A-game. Where Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band strained for significance, The Beatles was schizophrenic, and Let It Be was a drag streaked with greatness, Abbey Road lays out its terms precisely and meets them all. There's not a duff note on the damn thing. This applies even if, like me, you've never quite understood the attraction of John Lennon's ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and sometimes find yourself skipping ahead to George Harrison's second-side lead-off ""Here Comes the Sun"". ""I Want You"" is certainly a singular item in the Beatles discography, with its extreme repetition, stark simplicity, and epic three-minute coda, but it requires a certain kind of mood to appreciate. Yet, along with album-opener ""Come Together"", it also shows how Lennon finally found a way to square his latter-day interest in leaner and edgier rock'n'roll with trippy studio experimentation. Lennon's two big songs on the first side are raw, direct, and biting, but they're also lush studio creations, in keeping with the spirit of the album. And the sophisticated sheen laid over top has the effect of making them seem more like ""Beatles songs"" compared to, say, Lennon's White Album output. Abbey Road feels like one thing. Paul McCartney's ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" and Ringo Starr's ""Octopus's Garden"", two silly, charming, childlike songs in a long tradition of silly, charming, childlike Beatles songs, round out side one. But then, oh: side two. The suite that runs from ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" through ""Her Majesty"" finds the Beatles signing off in grand fashion. Gathering scraps of material that had piled up, McCartney and Martin pieced together a song cycle bursting with light and optimism, and this glorious stretch of music seems to singlehandedly do away with the bad vibes that had accumulated over the previous two years. From the atmospheric rip of Fleetwood Mac's ""Albatross"" that is ""Sun King"" to the sharp pair of Lennon fragments, ""Mean Mr. Mustard"" and ""Polythene Pam"" (the former given a line about ""sister Pam"" to join the pieces), and on through the explosive, one-climax-after-another run of ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window"", ""Golden Slumbers"", and ""Carry That Weight"", the nine fragments in 16 minutes add up to so much more than the sum of their parts. The music is tempered with uncertainly and longing, suggestive of adventure, reflecting a sort of vague wisdom; it's wistful, earnest music that also feels deep, even though it really isn't. But above all it just feels happy and joyous, an explosion of warm feeling rendered in sound. And then, the perfect capper, finishing with a song called ""The End"", which features alternating guitar solos from John, George, and Paul and a drum solo from Ringo. It was an ideal curtain call from a band that just a few years earlier had been a bunch of punk kids from a nowheresville called Liverpool with more confidence than skill. This is how you finish a career. The Beatles' run in the 1960s is good fodder for thought experiments. For example, Abbey Road came out in late September 1969. Though Let It Be was then still unreleased, the Beatles wouldn't record another album together. But they were still young men: George was 26 years old, Paul was 27, John was 28, and Ringo was 29. The Beatles' first album, Please Please Me, had come out almost exactly six and a half years earlier. So if Abbey Road had been released today, Please Please Me would date to March 2003. So think about that for a sec: Twelve studio albums and a couple of dozen singles, with a sound that went from earnest interpreters of Everly Brothers and Motown hits to mind-bending sonic explorers and with so many detours along the way-- all of it happened in that brief stretch of time. That's a weight to carry.

277,The Beatles,Yellow Submarine,Rock,6.2,September 10 2009,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Hey, nobody's perfect. The only truly minor album in the Beatles' catalogue isn't really an album at all. Yellow Submarine, released in January 1969, is the soundtrack to the feature-length cartoon of the same name, a project with which the Beatles had little involvement. The idea of an animated film stretched back to 1965, but these were busy years for the band, and the project was pushed to the backburner. Once the movie finally got underway in 1967, the Beatles had no real interest in the details. In one sense, the Yellow Submarine project is the opposite of Magical Mystery Tour. While the latter film was derided as pretentious and incoherent, the Yellow Submarine feature was well-received. And while the record releases associated with Magical Mystery Tour are of staggeringly high quality, the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered. Brian Epstein had died in August, and with him gone, there was little motivation for the Beatles to participate in any meaningful way. So actors mimicked their voices, their input into the story consisted of a meeting or two with the filmmakers, and when it came time to assemble the soundtrack, they combed through the vault to see what was left over. Of the six tracks by the Beatles on the album's first side, two, ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""All You Need Is Love"", are already familiar from their original contexts (as part of Revolver and as a single, respectively). The other four were holdovers from sessions in 1967 (Paul McCartney's ""All Together Now"", George Harrison's ""It's All Too Much"" and ""It's Only a Northern Song"") and 1968 (John Lennon's ""Hey Bulldog""). They never found release during the time they were recorded because, well, they weren't good enough. Granted, we're talking about a time when the Beatles were making some of the finest pop albums of all time, so the question of what constitutes ""good enough"" is relative. But even setting aside their exceedingly high standards, this lot is pretty middling, if certainly still enjoyable. Neither of Harrison's songs ranks with his best. ""Only a Northern Song"" and ""It's All Too Much"" are filled with swirling psychedelic production-- tooting horns, backward instruments, shimmering percussion-- but beneath the din there's not much else interesting going on. ""Only a Northern Song"" at least has a good joke going for it, simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' Lennon-McCartney-dominated publishing company (i.e., no matter what Harrison wrote for this particular number, it belonged to Northern Songs, Ltd.). But ""It's All Too Much"" stretches on for an endless six and a half minutes, the constipated production in fruitless search of a tune. For McCartney's part, ""All Together Now"" is a cheery and pleasant sing-along befitting an animated soundtrack, and Lennon's ""Hey Bulldog"" is a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, by a good margin the best song here. They might be second-rate Beatles songs, but still. To round out the album, the second side of Yellow Submarine is filled with George Martin's score for the film. Pieces like ""Pepperland"", ""Sea of Holes"", and ""March of the Meanies"", however they were received at the time, function now primarily as garish kitsch, lushly orchestrated orchestral music that could have come from anywhere. Personally, I can enjoy this stuff when I'm in the mood. The blandly anonymous but beautifully recorded swoop of strings, self-consciously ""exotic"" percussion, and recurring thematic motifs serve as an intriguing sort of time capsule of a time when light ""beautiful music"" still commanded the ears of a sizeable listening pubic. But it's very easy to forget that the music has anything to do with the Beatles, or even popular music of the last 50 years, at least until the ""Yellow Submarine"" melody returns in ""Yellow Submarine in Pepperland"". As a souvenir of the film, Yellow Submarine has its place, and in fairness, it was never intended as a major release. But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise.

278,The Beatles,The Beatles,Rock,10.0,September 10 2009,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"In his review of the Beatles' 1963 LP debut, Please Please Me, Tom Ewing pointed out that whether or not you consider them to be the best band of the rock'n'roll era, they certainly have the quintessential pop band story. Everything they did is deeply embedded in rock's DNA, and the band's offhand and ad-hoc gestures have long been established parts of pop music mythology. And of the Beatles' albums, none-- not even Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band-- rivals The Beatles as a rock archetype. The phrase, ""It's like their White Album""-- applied to records like Prince's Sign o' the Times, Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade, the Clash's Sandinista!, and Pavement's Wowee Zowee, among many others-- has long been accepted critical shorthand. To use the expression is to conjure a familiar cluster of associations: The work in question is large and sprawling, overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences, and filled with a hugely variable array of material, some of which might sound great one day and silly the next. A band's White Album is also most likely assembled under a time of great stress, often resulting in an artistic peak but one that nonetheless scatters clues to its creator's eventual demise. The Beatles, the band's complex and wide-ranging double album from 1968, is all of these things. It's a glorious and flawed mess, and its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs. People love this album not because every song is a masterpiece, but because even the throwaways have their place. Even so, for the Beatles, being all over the place was a sign of trouble. The disintegration of the group as one ""thing"" is reflected in every aspect of the record, from its recording history (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison sometimes worked in separate studios on their own songs) to its production (generally spare and tending to shapeshift from one song to the next) to the arrangements of the songs (which tend to emphasize the solo voice above all). Visual changes were also apparent. Until The Beatles, the group's album artwork tended to depict the band as a unit: same haircuts, same jackets, same costumes, same artist's rendering. But The Beatles was packaged with separate individual color photos of John, Paul, George and Ringo, and they now appear almost forebodingly distinct. All of a sudden, the Beatles neither looked nor sounded like a monolith. So soon after Pepper and the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, the writing was on the wall. But the backstory of The Beatles, while fascinating, is inessential to the album's appeal. Yes, they wrote most of it in India on acoustic guitar, while on a pilgrimage of sorts in early 1968 to see the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Some of Lennon's songs, including ""Sexy Sadie"" and ""Dear Prudence"", are based directly on the group's disillusioning experiences there. But it's the spectral, floating mood of ""Prudence"" and Lennon's playful, faintly condescending vocal in ""Sadie"" that stay with you. And while we know that Lennon's new love, Yoko Ono, was a regular presence during the session, much to the rest of the band's chagrin (McCartney has claimed that she would sometimes sit on his bass amp during a take, and he'd have to ask her to scoot over to adjust the volume), and that her influence on him led to the tape collage ""Revolution 9"", the more important detail is the final one, that the biggest pop band in the world exposed millions of fans to a really great and certainly frightening piece of avant-garde art. In one sense, ""Revolution 9"" almost seems like The Beatles in microcosm: audacious, repetitive, silly, and intermittently dull, but also pulsing with life. If the individual Beatles hadn't been on such a songwriting roll during this time or if the album hadn't been sequenced and edited so well, The Beatles could easily have been an overlong slog, a Let It Be x2, say. But somehow, almost in spite of itself, it flows. The iffy jokes (""Rocky Raccoon"", ""The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill"", ""Piggies"") and genre exercises (Lennon's aggro ""Yer Blues"", McCartney's pre-war pop confection ""Honey Pie"") are enjoyable, even without knowing that another gem is lurking around the next corner. If The Beatles feels more like a collection of songs by solo artists, they've also each got more going on than we'd realized. John is even more hilarious than we'd imagined, wanting nothing more than to puncture the Beatles' myth (""Glass Onion""), but he's also displaying a disconcerting willingness to deal with painful autobiography in a direct way (""Julia""). Paul's getting disarmingly soft and fluffy (""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"", ""I Will""), while simultaneously writing the roughest, rawest tunes in his Beatles oeuvre (""Back in the U.S.S.R."", ""Helter Skelter""). George is finding a better way to channel his new Eastern-influenced spiritual concerns into a rock context, while his songwriting toolkit continues to expand (""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Long Long Long""). And even Ringo Starr writes a decent song, a country & western number with weirdly thick and heavy production (""Don't Pass Me By""). Listening as the tracks scroll by, there's a constant feeling of discovery. But ultimately, the thing about this record is that the Beatles sound human on it. You feel like you're really getting to know them, just as they're starting to get to know themselves. Their amazing run between the latter part of 1965 through 1967 made them seem like a band apart, infallible musical geniuses always looking for another boundary to break. Here, they fail, and pretty often, too. But by allowing for that, they somehow achieve more. White Albums come when you surrender to inspiration: you're feeling so much, so intensely, that you're not sure what it all means, and you know you'll never be able to squeeze it all in.

279,The Beatles,Rock Band,Rock,9.5,September 9 2009,Chris Dahlen,,"Here's the story of the Beatles, as told by the intro to The Beatles: Rock Band. They started as four lads in a basement club, covering Chuck Berry for hours at a stretch. Girls screamed, and the band got bigger and bigger 'til it stormed the world (specifically, America). Tours and celebrity and more screaming girls followed, until suddenly the world was a drag-- and they ascended a magic escalator to the sky, where they rode the giant elephant god Ganesha up to the edge of the creation. They became saints, or gods, or something just as sacred, and on a tablet it was written: ""You don't mess with the Beatles."" That was Harmonix's mantra going into the project. The developers knew if they were going to handle one of the biggest properties in popular culture, they would take excruciating care to make it loyal, even worshipful. The visual design is warm and adoring, and each Beatle looks gentle and kind-- especially John Lennon, who's so beatific you almost forget that George Harrison has died, too. And the Beatles dominate the game.  They're the only people on the virtual stage: Eric Clapton never plays guitar and Billy Preston and Yoko Ono are expunged. More importantly, the Beatles ignore you. Every song is shown with period dress and setting: You can't play ""Helter Skelter"" in the Cavern in Liverpool or ""Boys"" at their 1969 rooftop concert. When you screw up, the screen just fades to black. In the first few clubs, the camera regularly cuts to those girls in the audience, screaming, in love. But they're not screaming for you. You, the player, are the disciple. You're here to study the music: To play as fast and loud as the band did in its youth, to finish the delicate ""Dear Prudence"" without a single bum note, to master Paul McCartney's bass line to ""I Saw Her Standing There"" on expert. The challenge is moderate compared to other music games, and harmony vocals are the only new feature: While the Beatles used strings, tape loops, and other effects, these are all channeled through the standard four instruments (guitar, bass, drums, and mic), and playing the strings for ""I Am the Walrus"" with the guitar controller works better than you might expect. But the harmony vocals make it a far better party game than previous Rock Band editions.  I've played with two additional singers, a guy who likes to belt Rush and a woman who's in a choir, and listening to them chant ""GUTEN MORGEN GUTEN MORGEN GUT"" was worth the price right there. The 45-track setlist balances better-known Beatles songs (""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", ""Day Tripper"") with deep cuts chosen for gameplay.  (The loping, sad ""Dig a Pony"" is an instant favorite.) The game even bends the canon, reaching out to the Love soundtrack's mix of ""Within You Without You"" with ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", which gives you the melody of the first with the drums of the second. Many songs also cut off before their fade-outs-- which was the right call, but it sounds strange on a song as burned in your brain as ""Yellow Submarine"". The first chapters take place in concert settings in front of screaming crowds. But after the Beatles quit the road in 1966, the game segues to the Abbey Road studio, where each song gets a ""dreamscape."" These vignettes recycle well-worn references for each song, and none of them would make the creators of Yellow Submarine lose sleep. Covering the band's psychedelic period, they're a thin metaphor for the fact that the band was well off their tits, but they also reinforce what an insular and magical place these recordings seem to emerge from-- especially if you skip the turmoil behind the scenes. That's not to say the game ignores their history. Good scores unlock rare photos dug from the archives, as well as clips of sound and video. You get their 1963 Christmas fan club record, a rough rehearsal for ""Ed Sullivan"", and a promotional film for ""Get Back"" edited out of outtakes from the Let It Be film. And there are clips of the band just chatting or goofing around.. They're candid, but the candidness doesn't make the band seem more human; rather, you feel like you're eavesdropping on a whole new level of divinity. The storytelling is at its finest in the last act, the rooftop show in London in 1969. The audience has aged and the band is tired. We never watch them fight, but the break-up is implied in the climax of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", where the camera jitters until the song cuts off. But encore ""The End"", the unannounced 45th song, is the proper send-off: Ultimately, the band was judged by the love they made. The word ""love"" sums up the entire vision for the game. Where past Rock Band and Guitar Hero titles emphasized the thrills and the grinds of rock, The Beatles: Rock Band feels completely different: it's soothing and cozy, and the songs keep luring you back not just because they're excellent and fun, but because the familiar recordings, the nostalgic visuals, and the Beatles' smiling faces make a peaceful, loving place. As a painstakingly crafted piece of fandom, it's a bullseye. But all this worship has a drawback. Discussing Rock Band 2, which doesn't use the likeness of any real stars, Harmonix's Helen McWilliams once told me, ""We want it to be about you, and your rock star fantasy... You're there with your band, for each other, and you're fulfilling your rock star dream together, and the audience is there for you."" The Beatles: Rock Band is the total opposite. The ""characters"" are untouchable, and the tracks don't even toss you a freestyle section. Your only choices are to get the song right, or not. Sure, it's a cliché that most videogames make you save the world, but at least in those games, you know you're needed. I've never felt less important in a game than this one. But I'll let 'em get away with it. After all, they're the Beatles.

280,The Beatles,Magical Mystery Tour,Rock,10.0,September 9 2009,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"After the death of manager Brian Epstein, the Beatles took a series of rather poor turns, the first of which was the Magical Mystery Tour film. Conceived as a low-key art project, the Beatles were oddly nonchalant about the challenges of putting together a movie. They'd assembled records, they'd worked on A Hard Day's Night and Help!-- how hard could it be? Without Epstein to advise, however, things like budgeting and time management became a challenge, and this understated experimental film turned into a sapping distraction. Musically, however, the accompanying EP was an overwhelming success. The EP format apparently freed the band to experiment a bit, not having to fill sides of a 45 with pop songs or make the grand statements of an album. The title track is a rousing set piece, meant to introduce the travelogue concept of the film. The remaining four songs released exclusive to the EP are low-key marvels-- Paul McCartney's graceful ""The Fool on the Hill"" and music-hall throwback ""Your Mother Should Know"", George Harrison's droning ""Blue Jay Way"", and the percolating instrumental ""Flying"". Few of them are anyone's all-time favorite Beatles songs, only one had a prayer of being played on the radio, and yet this run seems to achieve a majesty in part because of that: It's a rare stretch of amazing Beatles music that can seem like a private obsession rather than a permanent part of our shared culture. As a more laid-back release, the EP suggested the direction the band might have taken on the White Album had it remained a full band, happy to shed the outsized conceptualism and big statements and craft atmospheric, evocative pieces. In the U.S., the EP was paired with three recent double-sided singles, ballooning Magical Mystery Tour into an album-- the only instance in which a U.S. release, often mangled by Capitol, became Beatles canon. With only the EP's title track married specifically to the film's themes, the overall effect of a title track/album sleeve as shell game was in line with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Of the three singles, the undisputed highlight is ""Strawberry Fields Forever""/ ""Penny Lane"", John Lennon and Paul McCartney's tributes to their hometown, Liverpool. Slyly surreal, assisted by studio experimentation but not in debt to it, full of brass, harmonium, and strings, unmistakably English-- when critics call eccentric or baroque UK pop bands ""Beatlesesque,"" this is the closest there is to a root for that adjective. There is no definitive Beatles sound, of course, but with a band that now functions as much as a common, multi-generational language as a group of musicians, it's no surprise that songs rooted in childhood-- the one experience most likely to seem shared and have common touchpoints-- are among their most universally beloved. The rest of the singles collected here are no less familiar: Lennon's ""All You Need Is Love"" was initially completed up for an international TV special on BBC1-- its basic message was meant to translate to any language. Harrison's guitar solo, producer George Martin's strings, and the parade of intertextual musical references that start and close the piece elevate it above hippie hymn. Its flipside, ""Baby You're a Rich Man"", is less successful, a second-rate take on John Lennon's money-isn't-everything theme from the considerably stronger ""And Your Bird Can Sing"". It's the one lesser moment on an otherwise massively rewarding compilation. Much better from Lennon is ""I Am the Walrus"", crafted for the Magical Mystery Tour film and EP but also released as a double-sided single with McCartney's ""Hello Goodbye"". One of Lennon's signature songs, ""Walrus"" channels the singer's longtime fascinations with Lewis Carroll, puns and turns of phrase, and non sequiturs. ""Hello Goodbye"" echoes the same contradictory logic found in the verses of ""All You Need Is Love"", a vague sense of disorientation that still does little to balance its relentlessly upbeat tone. McCartney excelled at selling simplistic lyrics that risk seeming cloying, though, and he again does here-- plus, the kaleidoscopic, carnival-ride melody and interplay between lead and backing vocals ensure it's a much better record than it is a song. In almost every instance on those singles, the Beatles are either whimsical or borderline simplistic, releasing songs that don't seem sophisticated or heavy or monumental (even though most of them are). In that sense, they're all likeÂ ""All You Need Is Love"" or childhood memories or Lewis Carroll-- easy to love, fit for all ages, rich in multi-textual details, deceptively trippy (see Paul's ""Penny Lane"" in particular, with images of it raining despite blue skies, or the songs here that revel in contradictions-- ""Hello Goodbye""'s title, the verses in ""All You Need Is Love""). More than any other place in the band's catalogue, this is where the group seems to crack open a unique world, and for many young kids then and since this was their introduction to music as imagination, or adventure. The rest of the Magical Mystery Tour LP is the opposite of the middle four tracks on the EP-- songs so universal that, like ""Yellow Submarine"", they are practically implanted in your brain from birth. Seemingly innocent, completely soaked through with humor and fantasy, Magical Mystery Tour slots in my mind almost closer to the original Willy Wonka or The Wizard of Oz as it does other Beatles records or even other music-- timeless entertainment crafted with a childlike curiosity and appeal but filled with wit and wonder. On the whole, Magical Mystery Tour is quietly one of the most rewarding listens in the Beatles' career. True, it doesn't represent some sort of forward momentum or clear new idea-- largely in part because it wasn't conceived as an album. The accompanying pieces on the EP are anomalies in the Beatles oeuvre but they aren't statements per se, or indications that the group is in any sort of transition. But if there was ever a moment in the Beatles' lifetime that listeners would have been happy to have the group just settle in and release songs as soon as possible, it was just before and after the then-interminable 10-month gap between the Revolver and *Sgt. Pepper'*s. Without that context, the results could seem slight-- a sort-of canonized version of Past Masters perhaps-- but whether it's an album, a collection of separate pieces, or whatnot matters little when the music itself is so incredible.

281,The Beatles,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,Rock,10.0,September 9 2009,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"Finally free of touring, the Beatles next sought to be free of themselves, hitting on the rather daft concept of recording as an alias band. The idea held for all of two songs, one coda, and one album sleeve, but was retained as the central organizing and marketing feature of the band's 1967 album *Sgt. Pepper'*s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Hailed on its release as proof that popular music could be as rich an artistic pursuit as more high-minded media such as jazz and classical, the record's reputation and sense of ambition ushered in the album era. Its influence was so pervasive and so instructional regarding the way music is crafted and sold to the public that this is still the predominant means of organizing, distributing, and promoting new music four decades later, well after the decline of physical media. The concept, of course, is that the record was to be recorded by the titular fictional band, a washed-up rock'n'roll group on the comeback trail. (This was actually the second concept earmarked for the Beatles' next LP; the original, a record of songs about Liverpool, was abandoned when its first two tracks were needed for the group's next single, ""Strawberry Fields Forever""/ ""Penny Lane"".) Probably for the best, little of the fictional-band vision for the record made it through; what did last from that conceit are a few tangential ideas-- a satirical bent on popular entertainment and a curiosity with nostalgia and the past. The record opens with a phony live performance by the Lonely Hearts Band, a sort of Vegas act-- the sort of thing that, in 1963, people thought the almost certainly soon-to-be-passÃ© Beatles would be doing themselves in 1967. Instead, the Beatles had completed their shattering of the rules of light entertainment, even halting their own live performances, which they'd never again do together for a paid audience. Even as they mocked this old version of a performing band, ironically *Sgt. Pepper'*s and its ambitions helped to codify the rock band as artists rather than popular entertainers. In the hands of their followers, the notion of a pop group as a compact, independent entity, responsible for writing, arranging, and performing its own material would be manifested in the opposite way-- rather than holing up in the studio and focusing on records, bands were meant to prove in the flesh they could ""bring it"" live. Notions of authenticity and transparency would become valued over studio output. (To be fair, upstart bands had to gig in order to get attention and a reputation, while the Beatles, of course, could write, break, and rewrite their own rules; they had the luxury and freedom to take advantage of a changing entertainment world and could experiment with different, emerging models of how to function as a rock band in much the same way that Trent Reznor or Radiohead can today.) The freedom from live performance didn't necessitate that Beatles songs now sounded practiced or rehearsed, and indeed they weren't. Instead, they were studio creations assembled in sections and pieces. As the band splintered, this practice would spill over into releasing song sketches on the White Album and inspire, in part through necessity, the lengthy song cycle at the close of Abbey Road. On Sgt. Pepper's, the most rewarding manifestation of this shift was the record's most forward-looking piece, ""A Day in the Life"". Complex in construction and epic in feel, ""A Day in the Life"" nevertheless seems enveloping and breezy to listeners. Indeed, the sustained, closing ringing chord of the song comes a mere 4:20 into the track. ""A Day""'s only best-in-show competitor was McCartney's ""She's Leaving Home"". (As on Revolver, the peaks here were a mold-breaking closer and classically inspired story-song). ""A Day in the Life"" has only grown in estimation, rightfully becoming one of the most acclaimed Beatles tracks. ""She's Leaving Home"", by contrast, has slid from view-- perhaps too maudlin to work on classic rock radio and too MOR for hipster embrace, it was nevertheless the other headline track on Sgt. Pepper's when it was released. The story of a runaway teen, it misses as a defiant generational statement in part because it's actually sympathetic to the parents in the song. In the second verse, McCartney defies expectations by not following the young girl on her adventure but keeping the track set in the home as her parents wake to find her goodbye letter. In the end, we learn ""She"" left home for ""fun""-- a rather churlish reason, and when paired with McCartney's simplistic sentiments in ""When I'm 64"" (the aging couple there will be happy to ""scrimp and save""), the young girl seems more selfish than trapped. In fact, for a group whose every move was a generational wedge, and for such a modern record, the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper'*s is oddly conservative in places: ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" takes inspiration from a Victorian-era carnival; ""When I'm 64"" is a music-hall parody that fantasizes about what it would be like to be the Beatles' grandparents' age; ""Fixing a Hole"" has a rather mundane domestic setting; the fantasy girl in ""Lovely Rita"" is a cop. Lyrically, it's an atypical way to usher in the Summer of Love, but musically, the record is wildly inventive, built on double-tracking, tape effects, and studio technology. The dream-like haze of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", the fairground, sawdust feel of ""Mr. Kite"", and the cavalcade of sound effects at the end of ""Good Morning Good Morning"" were the most demonstrative sounds on the record, but otherwise benign passages were also steeped in innovation, whether recording from the inside of a brass instrument or plugging instruments directly into the sound board instead of capturing them through mics. Almost everything done on Sgt. Pepper's turned out to be new and forward-thinking, from the iconic record sleeve to the totemic ending to ""A Day in the Life"". There are very few moments in pop music history in which you can mark a clear before and after, in which almost everything changed. In the UK, it's arguably happened only five times, and on just four instances in the U.S. (Thriller here; acid house and punk there, and Elvis everywhere, of course); in both nations, the Beatles launched two of those moments. In retrospect, it almost seems like this time the band itself was taken aback by its own accomplishments, not only shying from directly living up to Revolver via the smoke and mirrors of the Lonely Hearts Club Band but then never again throwing themselves into their work as a collective unit. *Sgt. Pepper'*s, possibly as a corrective to the hushed tones with which it's been received for decades, has slipped in estimation behind a few of the band's other records, but it's easy to hear how it achieved that reputation in the first place. Even if John, Paul, George, and Ringo would arguably go on to best a handful of its moments, the amazing stretch of music created in 1966-67 was the peak of the Beatles as a working band.

282,The Beatles,Revolver,Rock,10.0,September 9 2009,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"Like any band, the Beatles' recording career was often altered, even pushed forward, as much by external factors as their own creative impulses. The group's competitive drive had them, at times, working to match or best Bob Dylan or Brian Wilson; their drug use greatly colored the musical outlook of John Lennon and George Harrison in particular; and the death of former manager Brian Epstein ushered in a period of distracting and poor business choices and opened the door for individuals such as the celebrity guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Yoko Ono, and businessman Allen Klein to penetrate, alter, and, some would say, disintegrate their inner circle. The most important of these external shifts in the Beatles narrative, however, was a series of changes that allowed them to morph into a studio band. The chain of events that ushered in the band's changing approach to studio music began before Rubber Soul, but the results didn't come into full fruition until Revolver, a 35-minute LP that took 300 hours of studio time to create-- roughly three times the amount allotted to Rubber Soul, and an astronomical amount for a record in 1966. Longtime Beatles producer George Martin, justifiably upset that EMI refused to give him a raise on the back of his extraordinarily profitable work with the Beatles, quit his post with the label in August 1965. Martin used his clout to create his own company, and the group and producer used theirs to effectively camp out at Abbey Road Studios for whatever length of time suited them rather than being forced to comply to the rigid and economically sound schedules demanded by labels at the time. The Beatles could now work both in and out of the studio, taking full advantage of new advancements in sound recording that allowed them to reflect upon and tinker with their work, explore new instruments and studio trickery, and refine their music by solving problems when they arose. This new approach not only greatly altered their work environment, but drove the Beatles to value the flexibility of emerging technology. They also cashed in some of their commercial capital to abandon the mentally and physically sapping practice of touring-- and the glad-handing and public relations requirements that went with it. Exceptionalism became the watchword for the band, and it responded by using its freedom to push forward its art and, by extension, the whole of pop music. Musically, then, the Beatles began to craft dense, experimental works; lyrically, they matched that ambition, maturing pop from the stuff of teen dreams to a more serious pursuit that actively reflected and shaped the times in which its creators lived. Revolver was also the first record in which the impression of the Beatles as a holistic gang was disrupted. The group had taken three months off prior to Revolver-- easily its longest break since the start of its recording career-- and each band member went his own separate way after years of moving around the world as a unit. Even without the break, it's possible that the group would continue to explore individual concerns: After starting to do just that on Rubber Soul, it was only natural that the Beatles wished to continue to highlight their individual strengths on its follow-up, and they did by listing each song's lead singer on the record sleeve. The first, surprisingly, was George Harrison, who kicks off the record with another stab at politics on ""Taxman"", and then later offers philosophical musings on ""I Want to Tell You"" and the Indian-flavored ""Love You To"". Over the next year or two, Harrison's guitar played a more background role in the group's recordings-- fortuitously, then, that time also corresponded with the years in which the Beatles were pleased to bunker down in the studio and most explore the dynamic tension between their individual interests and their final stretch of camaraderie and mutual respect. Lennon's primary interest throughout much of this time was himself, something that continued throughout his career-- he was always suspicious, even dismissive, of Paul McCartney's character songs, but once he and Yoko Ono joined forces, her Fluxus-rooted belief in art-as-subjectivity became orthodoxy in his mind. Lennon's early explorations of self and mind that began on Rubber Soul continued on Revolver, as the suburbanite spent much of his time at home indulging his zest for the exploratory powers of LSD. He contributes five songs to Revolver, and, indeed, each is concerned with drugs, the creative mind, a suspicion of the outside world, or all three. Each is also uniformly wonderful, and together they provide a tapestry of Lennon's burgeoning art-pop, which, along with Martin's inventive arrangements and playful effects, would peak the next year with the triumphs of ""I Am the Walrus"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", and ""A Day in the Life"". The gauzy ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and rollicking 1-2 of ""She Said She Said"" and ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" aren't nearly as demonstrative as the songs he'd write in their wake-- as a result each remains oddly underrated-- but they function as some of Lennon's most purely satisfying pop songs. ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" is another thing entirely. While ""Doctor Robert"" or ""She Said She Said"" touched on drug culture playfully or privately, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" was a full-on attempt to recreate the immersive experience of LSD-- complete with lyrics borrowed from Timothy Leary's *Tibetan Book of the Dead-*inspired writings. Remarkably, though, much of it due to Martin's experimental production, tape loops, and musique concrète-inspired backdrop, the song is lively and giddy instead of self-serious or preachy. Even Martin's primitive psychedelia could have been thudding and ponderous, and yet more than four decades later the entire thing seems less a clear product of its time than not only most art or experimental rock, but most Beatles records as well. Despite that triumph, however, Revolver was McCartney's maturation record as much as Rubber Soul was for Lennon. While Harrison was learning at the feet of sitar master Ravi Shankar and Lennon was navigating heavy use of psychotropic drugs, McCartney was refining his compositional chops by exploring classical music, training an eye for detail and subtlety in his lyrics, and embracing the orchestral work of Brian Wilson. McCartney's optimism and populism resulted in the most demonstrative songs he created for Revolver-- the brassy ""Good Day Sunshine"" (which delightfully toes the line between schmaltz and heartwarming) and ""Got to Get You Into My Life"", and the children's music staple ""Yellow Submarine"", an inventive and charming track too often derided as camp. (It's also an early indication that it would be McCartney who would hold tightest to the impression of the group as a unit-- the image of the band all living together here was, for the first time in years, untrue.) The understated qualities of McCartney's lyrics began to be misconstrued as simplistic in his ballads, but he provides three of his best here: ""For No One"", all the more affecting because it's slight and difficult to grasp, ""Here, There and Everywhere"", a model of sepia-toned sentimentality, and ""Eleanor Rigby"", which in its own way was as groundbreaking and revolutionary as ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". Virtually a short story set to music, ""Rigby"" and its interwoven descriptions of lonely people was and is a desolate and altogether mature setting for a pop song. Revolver in the end is the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence. The Beatles had been transformed into a group not beholden to the expectations of their label or bosses, but fully calling the shots-- recording at their own pace, releasing records at a less-demanding clip, abandoning the showmanship of live performance. Lesser talents or a less-motivated group of people may have shrunk from the challenge, but here the Beatles took upon the task of redefining what was expected from popular music. Lest we forget it, the original flashpoint of Beatlemania remains the most influential and revolutionary period in the Beatles career, but the creative high points of 1966-67 aren't far behind. It's worth remembering as well that what had been demanded or expected from them as entertainers and popular musicians was something they'd challenged from their first cheeky, flippant interview, but just a few years later they were no longer mere anomalies within the world of pop, no longer potential fads; they were avatars for a transformative cultural movement.

283,The Beatles,Rubber Soul,Rock,10.0,September 9 2009,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"To modern ears, Rubber Soul and its pre-psychedelic era mix of 1960s pop, soul, and folk could seem tame, even quaint on a cursory listen. But it's arguably the most important artistic leap in the Beatles' career-- the signpost that signaled a shift away from Beatlemania and the heavy demands of teen pop, toward more introspective, adult subject matter. It's also the record that started them on their path toward the valuation of creating studio records over live performance. If nothing else, it's the record on which their desire for artistic rather than commercial ambition took center stage-- a radical idea at a time when the success of popular music was measured in sales and quantity rather than quality. Indeed, at the time the Beatles did need a new direction: Odd as it seems today, the lifespan of a pop band's career in the early 60s could often be measured in months, sometimes in years, rarely in three-year increments. And by 1965, the Beatles were in danger of seeming lightweight compared to their new peers: The Who's sloganeering, confrontational singles were far more ferocious; the Rolling Stones' ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" was a much more raucous, anti-ennui cry than the Beatles' ""Help!""; and the Kinks beat the Beatles to both satirical, character songs and the influence of Indian music. By comparison, most of the Beatles music to date was either rock'n'roll covers or originals offering a (mostly) wholesome, positive take on boy-girl relationships. Above all, Bob Dylan's lyrical acumen and the Byrds' confident, jangly guitar were primary influences on John Lennon and George Harrison, respectively (and the Byrds had been influenced by the Beatles, too-- Roger McGuinn first picked up a Rickenbacker 12-string after seeing A Hard Day's Night). Dylan and the Byrds' fingerprints had been left on Help!-- Lennon, the group's biggest Dylan acolyte, played an acoustic rather than electric guitar throughout most of that record. Even Paul McCartney's ""Yesterday"" found him strumming an acoustic. (All this at a time when Dylan was beginning to move in the other direction and fully enter his electric period.) Harrison was growing more serious on the political ""Think for Yourself"", while ""If I Needed Someone""-- his other contribution to Rubber Soul-- is practically a Byrds pastiche and his chiming, sure-footed solo on ""Nowhere Man"" also displays a debt to that band. His deft touch is all over the record in subtle ways-- appropriate for an album full of finesse and small wonders (the ping at the end of the ""Nowhere Man"" solo, Lennon's exhalation in the chorus of ""Girl"", the ""tit-tit-tit"" of the backing vocalists in the same song, the burbling guitar in ""Michelle""). The most lasting influences of Dylan and the Byrds on the Beatles, however, were likely their roles in introducing the group to recreational drugs: Dylan shepherded the quartet through their first experience with pot, while the Byrds were with three-fourths of the Beatles when they first purposefully took LSD. (McCartney sat that one out, avoiding the drug for another year, while Harrison and Lennon had each had a previous accidental dosage.) Marijuana's effect on the group is most heavily audible on Rubber Soul. (By the time of their next album, Revolver, three-fourths of the group had been turned on to LSD, and their music was headed somewhere else entirely.) With its patient pace and languid tones, Rubber Soul is an altogether much more mellow record than anything the Beatles had done before, or would do again. It's a fitting product from a quartet just beginning to explore their inner selves on record. Lennon, in particular, continued his more introspective and often critical songwriting, penning songs of romance gone wrong or personal doubt and taking a major step forward as a lyricist. Besting his self-critical ""I'm a Loser"" with ""Nowhere Man"" was an accomplishment, and the faraway, dreamy ""Girl"" was arguably his most musically mature song to date. Lennon's strides were most evident, however, on ""Norwegian Wood"", an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison's first dabbling with the Indian sitar, and the mature, almost fatalistic heart-tug of ""In My Life"", which displayed a remarkably calm and peaceful attitude toward not only one's past and present, but their future and the inevitability of death. Considering Harrison's contributions and Lennon's sharp growth, McCartney-- fresh from the success of ""Yesterday""-- oddly comes off third-string on Rubber Soul. His most lasting contributions-- the Gallic ""Michelle"" (which began life as a piss-take, and went on to inspire the Teutonic swing and sway of Lennon's ""Girl""), the gentle rocker ""I'm Looking Through You"", and the grinning ""Drive My Car"" are relatively minor compared to Lennon's masterstrokes. McCartney did join his bandmate in embracing relationship songs about miscommunication, not seeing eye-to-eye, and heartbreak, but it wouldn't be until 1966 that he took his next great artistic leap, doing so as both a storyteller and, even more so, a composer.

284,The Beatles,Help!,Rock,9.2,September 8 2009,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"In A Hard Days Night, after throwing a sarky George Harrison out of their studio, a fashion-maven TV producer and his assistant try and make sense of him. Such a rude young man-- but is he ""an early clue to the new direction""? They consult the calendar: no, the new trend isn't due for another three weeks. It's a gag, and not an original one, but born of truth: the fashion watcher's assumption was that things ran on a two to three year cycle. As 1965 began, the Beatles obviously weren't going away, but being pop's aristocracy didn't necessarily make you pop's leading edge. The kids were coming up from behind. Commentators like Nik Cohn had noted sections of the pop audience looking to R&B clubs for their harder-edged, bluesier sound, and this was bleeding into the mainstream. The Animals could claim a no. 1, the Stones had two. So did London's Kinks, and if the Who didn't it was only because their routines were too extreme. And so, two years and four albums into their career, the Beatles at last had rivals. Serious ones, who'd rampaged through the door the Beatles opened and blithely ignored the showbiz conventions the Beatles were contractually tied to. While the Rolling Stones recorded ""Satisfaction"", the Beatles were being trotted around the world shooting the ambitious, ridiculous Help!. Its soundtrack album is as haphazard as Beatles For Sale, but lacks that record's glowering intensity. Luckily, it replaces moodiness with curiosity and a much-expanded instrumental palette. They'd been intermittent experimenters from the start, but Help! is where the band's interest in sound and arrangement really starts to flower, and this remastered version is a particular feast of new timbres and ideas: the percussion on ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"", Indian instrumentation appearing on ""Ticket to Ride"", the weary woodwind on ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"". All this is put into the service of some of the band's best pop songs. The title track, for instance, where Lennon's as confused and angry as he was on ""I'm a Loser"", but now the music doesn't follow suit-- its briskness blanks his pleas, and his bandmates sound more mocking than sympathetic. Paul gets similar finger-wagging backing on ""The Night Before"", a wonderfully jaunty song about being dumped after a one-night stand. ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"" is another song happy to marry beauty to venom-- its words an explicit threat, its harmonies an example of the seemingly effortless loveliness that makes people go gooey and mystical when the Beatles are mentioned. Obviously, their new interest in texture wasn't wholly distinct from their new interest in drugs. The ""reference"" in ""It's Only Love"" is played for laughs, but ""Tell Me What You See"" falls halfway between romance and mysticism and is rather awkward despite its marvelous period percussion. The album has other murky spots-- Harrison's songs are fine, but ""Act Naturally"" suggests that finding a tune for Ringo every album was becoming an issue. And the closing version of ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"" is a farewell to the ""end it with a rocker"" formula that drags despite Lennon's best efforts to rouse it. It doesn't help ""Dizzy"" that it's placed just after two personal breakthroughs for McCartney. ""I've Just Seen a Face"" and ""Yesterday"" are both love songs, rich with feeling but never overwrought, with the deceptive lightness that would become trademark and millstone for their writer. ""Face"", a folksy country song, demonstrated the gift for pastiche that would help give the rest of the Beatles' career such convincing variety. ""Yesterday"" went further, demonstrating that you could arrange a pop song orchestrally in a way that might deepen it, not just turn it into kitsch. Of all their tracks, ""Yesterday"" is surely the one that's hardest to listen to with new ears. This remaster, capturing its preternatural serenity, is a terrific opportunity to do exactly that. Help! is almost the last twitch of the Beatles as a working, gigging beat group. It's a great but confusing record, and no wonder contemporaries felt they might at last be losing direction. With hindsight confusion looks like transition, and the remasters-- issued all at once and linked to a game designed to present the band's story as a story-- can't help but invite that hindsight. But the story could have turned out differently, and these early records are still so fierce and alive. Taking the Beatles one disc at a time lets us recover their precariousness, the risks they took, what they lost as well as what they gained.

285,The Beatles,Beatles For Sale,Rock,9.3,September 8 2009,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"The Beatles faced the same pressures every teen sensation has since-- fatigue, frustration, being bounced into recording substandard material. ""It isn't a pot-boiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-Christmas mixture,"" claimed Derek Taylor on the Beatles For Sale sleeve. This pre-emptive strike looks more than a little defensive, especially when the cover versions are back in force, and one of them is the notorious and oft-detested ""Mr. Moonlight"". The workrate expected of early-1960s pop stars is one of the hardest things for modern listeners to get their heads around. We're used to bands making a record, touring in support, searching for inspiration, trying out new ideas, maybe two years later making another. Because our experience of the early Beatles is structured around their albums, we tend to think of them as doing something similar, except at a much more rapid pace. As Ian Macdonald's superb Revolution in the Head makes clear, this wasn't true: albums, singles, EPs, tours tumbled over one another with hardly a break-- a firehose of almost continuous activity. There were two reasons for this workload. Firstly the music industry simply hadn't worked out yet how to extend a record's shelf life-- singles weren't taken from albums after all. Secondly the lifespan of acts wasn't expected to be long, so it made sense to get the most work possible out of them. The famous hotch-potch of their early American catalogue was one result. The Beatles themselves were changing how the business worked, but Beatles For Sale, of all the British records, bears the stamp of these business realities. It's a mess. But it's a really good mess. Taylor's sleevenotes are also interesting because they go out of the way to reassure listeners that everything they're hearing can be reproduced live. Studio experimentation was becoming more important to the band and producer George Martin, but clearly someone viewed it with a little nervousness. You can understand why: The Lennon-McCartney originals on Beatles For Sale are often full of curious arrangements, drones, jagged transitions, and lashings of aggression. Blame pot, or the inspiration of Bob Dylan, or just the pressure-cooker environment the group was in, but the record hits a seam of angry creativity. This is particularly true of Lennon's amazing first three songs. ""No Reply"" shatters itself with waves of jealous rage, taking the menace that had flecked Beatles music and bringing it up in the mix: his dangerously quiet ""that's a lie"" is the most chilling moment in their catalogue. ""I'm a Loser"" turns that anger inward with just as much brutality. And ""Baby's in Black"" curdles a nursery rhyme, transforms the group's crisp pop sound into an off-kilter clang, and uses John and Paul McCartney's double vocal to thicken the soupy sound even further. This run of tracks marries the direct attack of their earliest material and the boundary-pushing of their later albums, and stands with the best of both. Even so it's a relief when ""Rock and Roll Music"" breaks the tension, especially when you notice that the band are playing their best rock'n'roll since ""Twist and Shout"". Perhaps the workrate had pushed them back into the Hamburg hot zone, but the uptempo covers on Beatles For Sale are fiercely good-- as ragged, loud and immediate as the songs needed to be. Even ""Mr. Moonlight"" fits the aggressive mood, the ugliness of its organ solo surely deliberate. McCartney's songs on Beatles For Sale are more thoughtful than moody, though on his splendid ""Every Little Thing""-- given melodramatic thrust by Shangri-Las-style piano and bass drum-- he's distinctly melancholy, his ""yes, I know I'm a lucky guy"" sounding like an attempt to convince himself of that. But Lennon's anger and the band's rediscovery of rock'n'roll mean For Sale's reputation as the group's meanest album is deserved, even if it has ""Eight Days a Week"" as its breezy centerpiece. The lumpiest and least welcoming of their early records, it's also one of the most rewarding.

286,The Beatles,A Hard Day's Night,Rock,9.7,September 8 2009,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"Pop in 1964 was part of showbiz: Once the Beatles hit a certain level of box office, there would never have been any question over making a film. Pop music meant teenagers, which meant fads, which meant the clock was running on the band's fame. The jazzman George Melly, who was writing about pop in the UK press at this time, remembered being convinced several times that the Beatles had hit a peak and their fans would soon desert them. I doubt this was an unorthodox opinion. A film career might extend the fame a little, and smooth the band's inevitable transition to light entertainment. If the film was an enjoyable romp, so much the better-- John Lennon asked for A Hard Day's Night director Richard Lester on the basis of a comedy short he'd made (later referenced in the film's famous ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence), but Lester had also helmed 1962's It's Trad, Dad!, a snapshot of the British pop world just pre-Beatles (Tagline: ""The newest, most frantic fad!""). He knew how to mix music and feelgood filmmaking to commercial effect. A Hard Day's Night, in other words, is a crucial inflection point in the Beatles' career. Coinciding with their leaving Liverpool and moving to London, this could easily have been their first step on a road of crowd-pleasing predictability: Instead, both film and this soundtrack album are a testament to how fabulous pop can be when you take care over doing it. The album is most famous now for being the first all-original record the band put out-- and their only all Lennon-McCartney LP. Formidably prolific at this point, the pair had been creating songs-- and hits-- for other performers which must have given them useful insight into how to make different styles work. There's been a particular jump forward in ballad writing-- on ""And I Love Her"" in particular, Paul McCartney hits a note of humble, open-hearted sincerity he'd return to again and again. His ""Things We Said Today"" is even better, wintry and philosophical before the surprising, stirring middle eight. But the dominant sound of the album is the Beatles in full cry as a pop band-- with no rock'n'roll covers to remind you of their roots you're free to take the group's new sound purely on its own modernist terms: The chord choices whose audacity surprised a listening Bob Dylan, the steamroller power of the harmonies, the gleaming sound of George Harrison's new Rickenbacker alongside the confident Northern blasts of harmonica, and a band and producer grown more than comfortable with each other. There's detail aplenty here-- and the remasters make it easy to hunt for-- but A Hard Day's Night is perhaps the band's most straightforward album: You notice the catchiness first, and you can wonder how they got it later. The best example of this is the title track-- the clang of that opening chord to put everyone on notice, two burning minutes thick with percussion (including a hammering cowbell!) thanks to the new four-track machines George Martin was using, and then the song spiraling out with a guitar figure as abstractedly lovely as anything the group had recorded. John Lennon's best songs on the record-- ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Tell Me Why"", ""When I Get Home"", ""You Can't Do That""-- are fast, aggressive, frustrated and spiked with these moments of breathtaking prettiness. The Hard Day's Night film itself was also a triumph in its way-- Lester's camerawork capturing the frenzy of Beatlemania and the way the group's music was feeding off it. It had the happy effect of introducing the group's millions of new global fans to their world-- the fire escapes, boutiques, bombed-out spaces, and well-preserved salons of 60s London. In fact the film's knowing dialogue and pop-art cinematography has a level of surface sophistication that the Beatles' records don't approach for another year or two (though they were already far more emotionally nourishing). Watching the film you're reminded that what the Beatles had set in motion was pop music's catching up with the rest of British popular culture: In art, in TV satire, in film and fashion and literature, the 60s were already a boom time. Pop had been left behind-- tastemakers looked instead to jazz and folk to soundtrack this creativity. What the Beatles had-- accidentally-- unlocked was pop music's potential to join, then lead, the party-- though it wasn't yet a given that they'd be the band to realize said potential. A Hard Day's Night is an album of an era when pop and showbiz were inseparable-- and if it doesn't transcend that time, it does represent its definitive peak.

287,The Beatles,With the Beatles,Rock,8.8,September 8 2009,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"Would that today's PRs had the honesty of Beatles pressman Tony Barrow. On the original sleevenotes for With the Beatles he cheerfully admits that the group were following the formula of Please Please Me, going so far as to make several track-by-track comparisons. ""[Paul McCartney] recalls the numerous Cavern Club occasions when this item ['Money'] brought forth the same type of overwhelming response given to 'Twist and Shout'."" Barrow's notes are direct and descriptive-- crediting each R&B find, noting which tracks were live favorites and who played what. They're an intriguing glimpse of how the band related to its audience in this first shock of pop success: as curious, educated listeners, not the blind screamers of Beatlemania legend. By this point, though, the Beatles were kings of Britain with the world about to follow. Their success was already game-changing: The band who would go on to invent the concept album invented the boy band first. The cheek, the gang mentality, the picking favorites-- all this would be formularized by later svengalis but emerged initially out of Beatle fandom. So With the Beatles is simultaneously a quickly turned-around cash-in and a record of real generosity and integrity. And if the structure of the album is pretty similar to Please Please Me, the extra studio time is already starting to tell. On McCartney's romantic spotlight, showtune ""Till There Was You"", producer George Martin builds a wholly convincing soft-focus soundworld around Ringo Starr's bongos. The group harmonies on tracks like their rumbustious ""Please Mr. Postman"" are even more gorgeously thick. The way the drums rumble in on ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is a moment of simple joy. And those are just the covers. With the Beatles starts with aggressive confidence, ""It Won't Be Long"" taking the ""yeah yeah"" chants that were the group's early calling card and turning them into missiles. We're back, it says, and it's one of their most thrilling songs. On ""All My Loving"" the guitars bubble and tumble and the band finds a new way to marry prettiness and drive. ""I Wanna Be Your Man""-- Ringo's best early vocal-- has a wolfish, hustling urgency. Not everything the band tries, as writers or interpreters, comes off: draggy girl group revival ""Devil in Her Heart"" is an obscurity too far, and George Harrison wins a first songwriting credit for the Shadows-esque ""Don't Bother Me"", but it doesn't get much spark until the guitar solo. As for ""Money"", well, there simply is no second ""Twist and Shout"" in the catalogue, but neither was there any shame in the Beatles trying. And it has its own thrills to offer: Less demonic and frenetic than that previous album-closer but by some way the heaviest thing they'd yet recorded, a quality the remaster brings fully out. Ringo's booming drums, John Lennon's sneer, and the others' banshee backing vocals all create an air of menace, repressed violence: the black leather and Bierkeller vibe of the band's 1961 proving grounds. It's a superb way to end an album that doesn't quite flow as well as Please Please Me, but never cheats the fans either. A week after its release the band would drop ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and rewrite the entertainment pecking order: For now they were living up to high expectations.

288,The Beatles,Please Please Me,Rock,9.5,September 8 2009,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"Whether or not you think the Beatles are the best rock band of all time, it's hard to deny they're the best rock story*.* Their narrative arc-- of graft, tragedy, and stardom; of genius emerging and fragmenting-- is irresistible. More so when you factor in the sense that they drove their fascinating times as much as mirrored them. But the satisfying sweep of the Beatles' epic risks doing them a disservice. It makes their achievements and development feel somehow predestined, an inevitable consequence of their astonishing talent. Of course, this isn't the case: Every record they made was born out of a new set of challenges and built around tough decisions. The marketing of the band over the past few decades by their record label, Apple, has been aimed at creating a sense of apart-ness: Let lesser talents digitize their songs, feature on compilations, sell their music to samplers. The Beatles are different. This flatters listeners who were there, but setting the band apart from the rest of the pop world risks sterilizing their music and making newcomers as resentful as curious. Besides, at the start they weren't so different at all. Britain in the early 1960s swarmed with rock'n'roll bands, creating local scenes like the Mersey Sound the Beatles dominated. Rock'n'roll hadn't died out, but it had become unfashionable in showbiz eyes-- a small-club dance music that thrived on local passion. It was raucous, even charming in a quaint way, but there was no money in it for the big-timers of the London music biz. At the same time the record market was booming. The Conservative UK government of the late 1950s had deliberately stoked a consumer boom: Aping the post-war consumption of the U.S., more British households than ever owned TVs, washing machines, and record players. The number of singles sold in Britain increased eightfold between the emergence of Elvis in 1956 and the Beatles in '63. Combine this massively increased potential audience with the local popularity of rock'n'roll and some kind of crossover success seems inevitable-- the idiocy of the Decca label in turning down the Beatles isn't so much a businessman's failure to recognize genius as a businessman's failure to recognize good business. The Beatles' life as a rock'n'roll band-- their fabled first acts in Hamburg clubs and Liverpool's Cavern-- is mostly lost to us. The party line on Please Please Me is that it's a raw, high-energy run-through of their live set, but to me this seems just a little disingenuous. It's not even that the album, by necessity, can't reflect the group's two-hour shows and the frenzy-baiting lengths they'd push setpiece songs to. It's that the disc was recorded on the back of a #1 single, and there was a big new audience to consider when selecting material. There's rawness here-- rawness they never quite captured again-- but a lot of sweetness too, particularly in Lennon-McCartney originals ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"". Rather than an accurate document of an evening with the pre-fame Beatles, Please Please Me works more like a DJ mix album-- a truncated, idealized teaser for their early live shows. More than any other of their records, Please Please Me is a dance music album. Almost everything on the record, even ballads like ""Anna"", has a swing and a kick born from the hard experience of making a small club move. And it starts and ends with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Twist and Shout"", the most kinetic, danceable tracks they ever made. The ""evening with the band"" feel makes Please Please Me a more coherent experience than other cover-heavy Beatles albums: Here other peoples' songs work not just as filler, but as markers for styles and effects the band admired and might return to as songwriters. McCartney, for instance, would go on to write songs whose drama and emotional nuance would embarrass ""A Taste of Honey"", but for now he puts his all into its cornball melodrama, and the song fits. Please Please Me also works as a unit because the group's vocals are so great. At least some of this is due to the remastering, which makes the Beatles' singing thrillingly up-close and immediate. I'd never really paid much attention to ""Chains"" and the Ringo-led ""Boys"", but the clearer vocals on each-- ""Chains""' sarcastic snarls and the harmonies helping Ringo out-- make them far more compelling. And as you'd imagine, making the voices more vivid means Lennon's kamikaze take on ""Twist and Shout"" sounds even more ferocious. Done in one cut at the session's end, it could have been an unusable wreck. Instead, it's one of the group's most famous triumphs. This sums up the Beatles for me. Rather than a band whose path to the top was ordained by their genius, they were a group with the luck to meet opportunities, the wit to recognize them, the drive to seize them, and the talent to fulfil them. Please Please Me is the sound of them doing all four.

289,The Beatles,Stereo Box,Rock,10.0,September 7 2009,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"In 1987, the Beatles' albums appeared on compact disc for the first time. Considering how much music had already found its way to CD, the Beatles were very late, so the digital rollout was a big deal. The new issues came out in batches and the excitement steadily built, peaking when Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band came out on June 1, 1987, the 20th anniversary of its original release (""It was 20 years ago today..."" was perhaps the greatest record marketing hook of all time.) In the 22 years since, plenty of bands have had their catalogues reissued a few times over (some with ridiculous frequency-- looking at you, Bowie and Costello), either to take advantage of improvements in technology or to repackage the records to sell them again to existing fans. But those 1987 CD versions have been it as far as the original Beatles albums. They've done some special projects-- Let It Be...Naked, two volumes of The Capitol Albums, collecting American versions of their records, the remix album Love-- but if, two months ago, you wanted to buy a copy of A Hard Day's Night, you'd be getting the 1987 remaster, done with 1987 technology, complete with a flimsy, bare-bones CD insert in a jewel case. This week, Capitol/EMI rectifies the situation. The entire Beatles catalogue has been remastered and the CDs are coming out in new editions. It is perhaps ironic that this is happening as interest in the compact disc format is on the wane, but once again Beatles fans are excited. Are they worth buying again? Over the next three days, we're going to be reviewing all of the Beatles reissues, including the Beatles Rock Band game also coming out this week. But in addition to discussing the music and the records, we wanted to take a moment here to lay out some general thoughts on the sets, with further details relegated to the proper reviews. First, the configurations. All 12 original albums, from Please Please Me to Let It Be, have been remastered and are being issued in stereo (these are the same tracklistings as have been on CD since the 80s, including the American version of Magical Mystery Tour). In addition, the two Past Masters CDs, which collect singles and tracks that didn't appear on the original albums, have been combined into one 2xCD set. The first four albums are appearing in stereo on CD for the first time. The packaging for all stereo CDs includes the original artwork and liner notes, along with new recording notes and a historical essay. Rather than jewel boxes, the stereo CDs are packaged in sharp-looking and durable foldout cardboard packaging. Each CD contains a short documentary in QuickTime format on the making of the album (these are said to be limited to this initial reissue). The packaging in general is very well done; the albums feel like they were put together with care and great attention to detail. You hold one in your hand, and it feels important. I've never been a fan of the plastic jewel box, and it's wonderful that they've done away with them here. CDs slide into a little pocket, so there are no spindles to break. The liner notes are succinct and informative, they favor the factual over the hyperbolic, and they cover what should be covered. The documentaries are well done but about what you would expect: four minutes long or so, narrated with interviews with the Beatles and George Martin culled from the Anthology project, with archival photos and film footage. They're certainly nothing revelatory, but a nice intro to the world of the album for anyone unfamiliar with the details. All in all, they did the packages right. In addition to the individual CDs, the reissues are available in two box set configurations. The Stereo Box collects the stereo versions of all the albums and adds a DVD gathering all the short documentaries in one place. In Mono-- limited, but it's not exactly clear yet how limited-- is more of a specialty item. It presents mono mixes of albums (which are available only in the box set, not for sale individually) from P**lease Please Me up through The Beatles (aka the White Album). Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road, and Let It Be were never mixed for mono, and are not included, but the set does include a 2xCD set called The Mono Masters with mono mixes of most of the singles included on Past Masters (a few of the later ones were never mixed for mono). Each record included with In Mono appears in a mini-LP replica package, accurate all the way down to the original printing on the inner sleeves (yep, you can slide the CDs in them if you want). Two discs, Help! and Rubber Soul, also contain the original stereo mixes on the same disc as the mono mixes (the 1987 CD issues were newly remixed for stereo). The original inserts included with the LPs-- the individual portraits in The Beatles, the cut-outs in Sgt. Pepper's-- are included as well. There are no CD booklets in In Mono; rather, the set contains a separate booklet of liner notes, covering the Mono Masters set in detail, and explaining the differences between the stereo and mono mixes of the proper albums. There are also no mini-documentaries. Why mono? Two reasons. First, pop music in stereo was still a novelty through most of the 60s. Radio was dominated by single-channel AM, and the young people who bought LPs were far more likely to have a mono record player as a sound source. Given their audience and the technology of the time, for much of the Beatles' run, the band themselves considered the mono mix as the ""real"" version of the record and devoted more of their attention to it. Mono mixes were prepared first with the involvement of the band, and in some cases, George Martin and EMI engineers completed stereo remixes of the albums later, after the group had left the studio. So mono, first off, presumably hews closer to the intentions of the Beatles themselves. It's what the Beatles had in mind, their vision of the records. Secondly, since the mono and stereo mixing sessions happened at different times, there are differences between the two versions, not just in the balance of the sound but also in the actual content. Different takes were sometimes used for punching in overdubs, or an alternate vocal take might make its way into the mix. Sometimes tracks were edited differently, and would be shorter or longer, and in some cases the tape ran at a slightly different speed, changing the pitch slightly. Some of the differences are subtle, and some are not. The mono version of ""Helter Skelter"", to take one example, is a minute shorter, as the ""false"" ending fadeout is presented as the track's true ending (and it thus omits the closing scream of ""I got blisters on my fingers!"") The significance of these differences will depend on the level of one's Beatles fandom; of course, those shelling out for the In Mono box will likely enjoy poring over the details. Comparing stereo and mono versions also offers an opportunity to think about changes in the technology of music listening. In the 60s, far fewer people listened to music on headphones. Music was meant to be heard through the air-- over the radio, in a car, on a jukebox, in a living room. And mono mixes were not designed with headphone listening in mind. It's been pointed out that mono records heard through headphones can sound like they are coming from a single point in the middle of your head, which can feel strange. I find that as the decade wore on and stereo mixes became more sophisticated, the Beatles' albums become less interesting on headphones when they are in mono-- the swirling pans of psychedelic material like ""I Am the Walrus"" or ""Revolution 9"" moving around are missed. From roughly Revolver forward, if I'm listening on headphones, I generally prefer the stereo mixes. Over a sound system, though, the mono mixes throughout the catalogue sound absolutely wonderful. The first four albums, however, with their extreme stereo separation, sound much better in mono in my opinion, regardless of the playback source. In any case, the sound of these remasters, mono or stereo, is exceptional. I've always felt that the sound quality of the original 1987 remasters was slightly underrated. The CD issues were well received at the time and were considered state of the art, but as the years wore on and the label never did anything to improve them, resentment set in and people began to focus on their flaws. Fair enough. But whatever you think of the 1987 remasters, these new versions are a marked improvement. In terms of clarity and detail, they are consistently impressive. But they're also successful for showing restraint. In the last few years, there's been a lot of talk about the ""loudness war""-- the tendency to over-compress and master albums too ""hot,"" so that dynamic range is squashed and peak-level sounds are pushed to the point of clipping. Fortunately, that has not happened here. These CD versions are definitely louder across the board, but there's still plenty of breathing room, so that the dynamic sound-- and these records were nothing if not dynamic-- hits the way they should. Interestingly, the mono mixes are uniformly a bit quieter than the stereo mixes, tending to fall somewhere between the original stereo master and the new one. To get geeky here for a moment, a few diagrams, so that you can see the increases in volume with the new set. The key when looking at waveforms is to take note of whether the peak sounds (which come closest to the volume ceiling inherent in digital audio) maintain the same relationship to the quieter sounds. I'm not an engineer, but the loudest sounds:quietest sounds ratio looks to me to be intact. ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" [1987 Remaster] ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" [2009 Remaster] ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" [Mono] ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" [1987 Remaster] ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" [2009 Remaster] ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" [Mono] ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" [1987 Remaster] ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" [2009 Remaster] Listening to the new masters, the differences in sound quality generally manifest in three ways: songs have more ""punch,"" with Paul McCartney's bass (an absolute wonder throughout) and Ringo's drums hitting with more force; the separation is better, so that instruments and (especially) layered vocals have more definition-- when the Beatles are harmonizing, you can more easily pick out the different vocalists, and the voices have more presence; and finally, the sound in general seems just a touch brighter, with various sound effects, cymbals taps, and so on, ringing with more clarity. The differences to my ears are not quite night and day, but they are certainly there, and they are noticeable. And it's satisfying to have these albums, absolutely some of the best-engineered records in the history of pop music, sounding as good as they can. And now, onto the music. Note that, rather than doing so for individual records, we're designating the Beatles sets as a whole as ""Best New Reissues"".

290,Radiohead,Hail to the Thief: Special Collectors Edition,Rock,8.6,August 27 2009,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"By 2003, Radiohead were trapped in a musical era they helped invent. By that time, they had essentially completed the ideal life cycle of a rock band, rising from an intermittently promising debut to become one of the world's biggest bands, creators of twin masterpieces that captured the fear, exhaustion, alienation, and anxiety of modern life in near-perfect musical settings. There is no rock record that did more to set the tone and establish the parameters for rock music in this still-young century than Kid A, an intentional masterpiece so brimming with creativity it spawned a sequel in Amnesiac. How does a band follow that up? Well, for one thing, it doesn't try to make another masterpiece. The record Radiohead did make, Hail to the Thief, is almost an anti-masterpiece, a well-sequenced collection of songs that finds them internalizing the blend of experimental electronics and straightforward rock they wore so far out on their sleeves just a few years earlier. They basically started over, and on the record, the band sounds aware that it's peaked in a way, and perhaps less sure of where it wants to go. I hear the tension between a band that started to make the back-to-basics album guitarist Ed O'Brien so frequently mentions in interviews and a band that self-consciously want to do something new each time out and perhaps even feels guilt when it fails to innovate. They'd pushed their horizons so far already that they didn't have much exploring left to do. Confusion and apprehension are written all over the album. Just look at the tracklist: ""Scatterbrain"". ""A Wolf at the Door"". ""Sit Down. Stand Up"". ""2+2=5"". ""Backdrifts"". They couldn't even decide what to call the songs, giving each one an obtuse parenthetical co-title. When Thom Yorke sings, ""I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied,"" on ""Myxomatosis"", he sounds as though he's talking himself out of a creative eddy, and what better way to do it than over a crazed, fuzzed-out odd-metered groove? At 14 tracks and 56 minutes, Hail to the Thief is easily the longest Radiohead album, and it doesn't seem accidental that two-thirds of the way through lies a song called ""There There"", as if the band is consoling itself, recognizing that there are worse challenges than carrying forward in a successful rock band. ""There There"" has one of the album's many ambiguous refrains in its ""just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there"" turnaround, which could be taken as a brief rebuke to the anxieties expressed earlier. But what's even more striking about the song is how unremittingly gorgeous it is. It has a melody fitting for a jazz standard, but just as important is the rhythmic undercarriage. Drummer Phil Selway hardly plays a conventional rock beat anywhere on the album, here using kettle drums to give the song a distinctive buoyancy, while Colin Greenwood's bass part constitutes a second melody. Selway and Greenwood run away with ""Where I End and You Begin"", creating a rushing current to carry along the queasy synths and understated vocal. It's one of the album's few vocals that could reasonably be called understated. Thom Yorke uses his full range across the record to give voice to anger, defeat, affection, frustration, and longing. He's a fantastic singer in general, but his real strength is in the way he can latch onto a simple phrase like ""over my dead body"" and twist and pull it to mean whatever he wants it to. His most virtuoso performance on the album comes on its breathtaking closer, ""A Wolf at the Door"", where he balances a frantically paced, paranoid verse with a towering chorus. It's on songs like this where you realize that this album, more than any of their LPs since The Bends, simply lets you concentrate on a what a good band Radiohead is without distracting you with thematic concerns, conscious innovation, or attempts to force a bend in the band's artistic arc. Hail has a few low points and could probably be edited to make it that much more digestible-- apart from its tumbling bridge, ""We Suck Young Blood"" is a momentum-killer between the sinuous groove of ""Where I End and You Begin"" and the tangled loops of ""The Gloaming"" (it's also somewhat similar to the superior ""Sail to the Moon""), while the brief ""I Will"" is pretty distracting from the album's overall flow. I would've been happier with it as a B-side. ""A Punchup at a Wedding"" has a disappointingly flat refrain, but makes up for it with the funky swagger of its rhythm track. Even the lowest points have their considerable merits, though, to the point where it even bears wondering whether Radiohead can even make a bad album at this point. The tracks they did relegate to B-sides, now included on the second disc of Capitol's reissue, were certainly well-suited to their release format. ""Paperbag Writer"" is an interesting, even worthy experiment with programmed beats, a whacked-out bass line and creepy strings courtesy of Jonny Greenwood that at first sounds like an update on Martin Denny's version of ""Quiet Village"". Its counterparts sound for all the word like odds and ends. Even the title of ""I Am Citizen Insane"" sounds forced, ""Where Bluebirds Fly"" is an exercise in creating texture with almost no content, and three of the four remixes and alternate versions that backed ""2+2=5"" aren't especially interesting (Four Tet's take on ""Scatterbrain"" is the squirming exception). Yorke's piano sketch ""Fog (Again)"" is nice, and the quiet, acoustic ""Gagging Order"" is practically a throwback to the stuff they were putting on B-sides in the mid-90s, which is to say it's by far the best B-side included in the bonus material. Even if it is a cash-grab by Capitol (and who can blame them the way things are going?), the bonus disc is a convenient aggregator for the band's fans. The video content on the third disc, meanwhile, offers little you can't experience easily on the Internet. The reissue also offers a chance to re-assess an album that's oddly failed to develop a solid reputation over the years since its release-- I've heard it described as everything from a disappointment to ""their best album"" to ""too long"" to ""I don't remember what it sounds like"" by fans of the band. For a while, I identified most with the last statement-- there's no denying that Hail to the Thief took longer to settle for me than any of their four preceding albums. Time and persistence have been kind to it, though. Hail to the Thief isn't Radiohead's best album, but it doesn't need to be, either. There are other albums for that. It did, however, prove that there can be life for a band after its landmark statement, and that life sounds pretty damn good.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13384-hail-to-the-thief-special-collectors-edition/,Capitol,2009.0
291,Radiohead,Amnesiac: Special Collectors Edition,Rock,9.5,August 26 2009,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"You've released a series of masterpieces in a row, each more challenging and rewarding than the last. You're being called the greatest band in the world, and many want you to become the biggest. You've been charged with uniting and possibly leading a large group of listeners who spent the late-1990s exploring some combination of the outré genres of post-rock, IDM, exotica, Tropicália, and French house; the emotionally resonant yet textural sounds of artists like Björk, the Verve, Beck, Stereolab, and Spiritualized; and the once-potent but now flagging spheres of rave, jungle, and techno. In short, there's a hell of a lot of pressure on you. Whether prescient or just fortunate, Radiohead never had to create a new set of songs under the weight of these expectations. Instead, they followed the instant-classic Kid A with what they had planned to do from the start: Relatively quickly issue another set of songs recorded at the same time, a lengthy studio-bound period that ate up much of 2000. Appearing nine months after Kid A, Amnesiac faced an uphill climb as steep as the icy mountains that adorned the earlier record's cover. And so it was that the record was met with derisive ""Kid B"" jokes, sniffed at as pretentious, or considered the work of a band that had moved a little too far to the left. In the face of choosing between the forward-looking sounds of Radiohead and the revivalism hailed as the New Rock Revolution, a lot of listeners and critics chose the easy way out. Eventually, later in the decade, artists like the Knife, Animal Collective, Liars, and LCD Soundsystem would carry the mantle of blending genres and upsetting listener expectations in rewarding ways. But in 2001, in an era when the radio and MTV were still the primary delivery systems for new music-- and after the majors felt burned by electronica, or by U2 and Smashing Pumpkins' ahead-of-the-game attempts to experiment with electronics in a stadium-rock setting-- creatively ambitious guitar music was still considered a commercial misstep. Amnesiac was in some ways another leap beyond Kid A, an album that already was heavily influenced by experimental electronic music, 20th century classical, and ambient music, and often featured the manipulation of singer Thom Yorke's voice and found Jonny Greenwood ditching his guitar for a compositional electronic instrument called the Ondes Martenot. To a generation raised on Pearl Jam and Oasis, it wasn't always easy listening. Three other things handicapped the record from the go: First, the belief that, because these songs were released after those on Kid A, the band felt they were inferior, which has never been the case. Second, in order to ensure Amnesiac's summer 2001 release, Kid A wasn't promoted in a traditional manner: No singles were officially pulled from the record, and no videos were created. The band commissioned a series of online ""blips,"" short films that preceded the record's release, but because the LP wasn't being milked for extra product it appeared to be a unique, complete piece unsullied by scrupulous promotion or overexposure. If you wanted to listen to Kid A, you listened to the CD, at a time of your choosing, generally front to back. As Rob Mitchum said in his review yesterday, for many, it was virtually the last record they engaged with in this way. Amnesiac, by contrast, was promoted with singles, which gave it an aura of both ordinariness compared to Kid A and gave the impression that the band itself, threatening even then to dismantle the received wisdom about how to record, promote, and release music in the digital age, had caved to the wishes of their label. More than all that, however, Amnesiac is the first album I can remember most everyone I know getting online in bits and pieces. In the slipstream between encoding mp3s and records leaking in full, songs would tend to dribble out one by one. For a record like Amnesiac, this was particularly disadvantageous. The word on Kid A was already that it flowed so perfectly as an album (which is half-true: Like Daft Punk's Discovery, also out that year, its first half does. But then each CD featured a palate-cleansing instrumental and a more traditional second half which, other than their respective finales, could have been arranged in arguably any order.) For Amnesiac, the tracklisting is important because of the tension it creates rather than the comfortable way in which it flows. As a result, there are a number of songs that work as experiments or filling between more traditional pieces, and these tracks' power is heightened when you listen to the record straight through. When you've spent 30 minutes to download a song, you don't want to hear something like Robert Fripp homage ""Hunting Bears"" or leftfield excursions like ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"" or ""Like Spinning Plates"". They work just fine as standalone songs to my mind, but many in 2001, upon first encountering them, felt cheated. No more so than with the band's decision to release a second version of Kid A's ""Morning Bell"". At the peak of the bloated CD era, when a record is already a ""mere"" 44 minutes long, spending three of those precious minutes re-working a song from your previous album wasn't a popular move. Yet despite the supposed arm's-length coldness of Amnesiac, it's an emotionally resonant and often very warm record. When the group aims for rich, tonal undercurrents of sound beneath swelling, heart-lifting arrangements, on Amnesiac the songs are less likely to be buffered by electronic crackles and pops or swirling strings. The difference is most notable in that second version of ""Morning Bell"", but pick any of the album's more glacial, atmospheric songs and you have the blueprint for the band today. ""Pyramid Song"" and ""You and Whose Army?"" surely, but even rhythmic, vibrant songs like ""I Might Be Wrong"" and ""Dollars & Cents"" sound like the itchy, impatient way in which Radiohead today balance their rock and electronic impulses. As a whole, the friction within a song like ""I Might Be Wrong"" is played out on a grand scale, heightened by some of Yorke's more aggressive lyrics. After the evocative, often lonesome and disconnected lyrics of Kid A, Amnesiac's snap more clearly into place and often are pointed or defensive. ""You and Whose Army?"" and ""Knives Out"" on their surface carry tinges of violence, while elsewhere Yorke pleads for people ""to get off [his] case"" or threatens to ""crack your little souls."" The strains of paranoia that had run throughout Yorke's songs for a half-decade came most sharply into view on album closer, ""Life in a Glasshouse"", which oddly seems to predict the post-9/11 Bush administration's misguided warmongering (in Iraq), belief that patriotism is equated with obedience, and willingness to trade liberty if they believe it will bring security. The only song on Amnesiac recorded after the release of Kid A, it would also have been the only song recorded after the election of Bush, and with its stately, funereal New Orleans jazz arrangement it provides an earthy, traditional close to the forward-looking Kid A/Amnesiac. Released again, with its grab bag of B-sides-- some more interesting than lovable, but all worth hearing-- and a few songs recorded in a Paris studio (all reconstructed enough to make them worthwhile, if a bit sterile at times in this environment), Amnesiac can ideally take its rightful place among Radiohead's acknowledged classics. More than Kid A-- and maybe more than any other LP of its time-- Amnesiac is the kickoff of a messy, rewarding era in which rather than owning records that were of a piece, we listen and engage with a wide variety of sounds in jumbled, sometimes confusing ways. And Amnesiac sounds like what the dawn of the mp3 era sounded like: disconnected, self-aware, tense, eclectic, head-turning-- an overload of good ideas inhibited by rules, restrictions, and conventional wisdom.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13407-amnesiac-special-collectors-edition/,Capitol,2009.0
292,Radiohead,Kid A: Special Collectors Edition,Rock,10.0,August 25 2009,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"We used to listen to music in an entirely different way. There was once a time when music was organized into 45- to 75-minute chunks-- often a few standout tracks padded with a lot of mediocre filler, but occasionally designed so that the parts built up a larger structure. Used to be, people would sit down and listen to that lengthy piece of music from front to back in one sitting, resisting the urge to jump to their favorite parts or skip over the instrumental interlude that served as grout between two fuller compositions. These antiques were called CDs. Here's a story about the last of its kind. When Kid A came out in October 2000, it sounded like the future. Unless you were a Napster whiz-kid, the record was one of the last to arrive unspoiled and complete, a physical object, the disquieting Stanley Donwood art reinforcing its dark mystery. It's arguably two-and-a-half minutes into ""How to Disappear Completely""-- more than a third of the way through the album-- until anything sounds like a ""Radiohead Song,"" even with how far the elastic of that term was stretched on OK Computer. And while Radiohead were far from the first to glitch-up their vocals with a computer or drown their compositions in ambient washes, it was still a thrilling experimental gamble for a band that could've profitably re-made ""Karma Police"" 100 times over with minimal reputational damage. But simply flirting with new technology wasn't enough; even in 2000, the idea of a band ""going electronic"" was a laughable marketing gimmick from an era that spawned the term ""electronica."" But the samples, loops, and beats of Kid A were more than just the patronizing dalliance of a bored band, they were tools used to service the album's even deeper exploration of OK Computer's thesis on identity loss in computerized society. It was, unashamedly, a complete album, one where everything from production to arrangements to lyrics to album art were carefully crafted towards a unified purpose. It's also a contoured album without clear highlights, best experienced in one sitting rather than cherrypicking the best parts. (It's telling that the band famously quarreled over the sequencing of tracks.) The biggest stylistic coup was the corruption of Thom Yorke's vocals-- arguably the band's most singular feature up to that point-- and the detuned-radio effects of the album's opening couplet: ""Everything in Its Right Place"" and ""Kid A"" threw listeners expecting that signature ""Fake Plastic Trees"" falsetto immediately into the deep end. On ""The National Anthem"", Yorke is shouted down by horn section mayhem, and when he finally gets in an unfiltered word in on ""How to Disappear Completely"", it's the album's most haunted (and revealing) line: ""That there, that's not me."" There's no storyline to pick out from Yorke's lyrics, but a unified thread moves through the album nonetheless: Basically, Kid A is scary as hell. It might be the paranoid, nearly subliminal, unbroken undercurrent of haunted drone, courtesy of a Rhodes or a tape loop or Jonny Greenwood's Ondes-Martenot, a instrument for nightmares if there ever was one. Or it might be Yorke's terrifying one-line, Chicken Soup for the Agoraphobic Soul mantras that alternate between honeyed violence (""cut the kids in half"") and clichÃ©s and hum-drum observations twisted into panic attacks (""where'd you park the car?""). (A brief intermission to talk about the bonus tracks included with this reissue. Capitol's in a tough spot with finding Kid A outtakes, because they already released such a thing-- it's called Amnesiac...rimshot. So instead the bonus-disc padding is all live tracks, culled from British and French radio or TV shows. In keeping with the album's isolation fixation, the empty studio of the four-track BBC session is the most fitting environment for the band's performance, the vocal manipulations of ""Everything in Its Right Place"" ricocheting off egg-crate walls. Contrast that with the clap-along crowd on an ""Idioteque"" from France, which neuters the song's sinister undercurrent and turns it into an inappropriate party jam.) Every great album needs a great resolution, and Kid A has two: the angelic choir and harps of ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" which serve as a much-needed (if fragile and a bit suspicious) uplift needed after such unrelenting bleakness, and a brief ambient coda that justifies the hidden-track gimmick. The silence that surrounds that final flash of hazy analog hiss is almost as rich, conferring a eerie feeling of weightlessness upon anyone who's completed the journey with a proper headphones listen. But that's where the twist ending comes in. Kid A turned out not be the music of the future, but a relic of the past, more in line with dinosaurs like Dark Side of the Moon or Loveless as try-out-your-new-speakers, listen-with-the-lights-off suites. By the time Amnesiac officially arrived, it had been served up piecemeal on the internet, handicapping the final product from reproducing its predecessor's cohesive structure. From then on, albums have persisted, sure, but they're increasingly marginalized or stripped for parts-- release Kid A today, and many might choose to save or stream ""Idioteque"" and Recycle-Bin the rest, missing the contextual build and release that makes the album's demented-disco centerpiece all the more effective. That's not a qualitative judgment: The way things are now isn't better or worse, just different. Technology, of course, is a selection pressure, digital music eroding the arbitrary 45ish-minute barrier that once was dictated by vinyl's finite diameter. But while a single song will often do, there's a talent to building and a pleasure in experiencing a dozen songs weaved together into a 40 minutes that's richer than each individual track, a 12-course meal for special occasions between microwave snacks. Like calligraphy, it's a fading art, as even Radiohead themselves seem to be disinterested in the format, perpetually threatening to dribble tracks out in ones or fours when the spirit takes them. In the end, one of the many ghosts that haunt the corridors of Kid A is The Album itself, it's death throes an unsettling funeral for a format that, like so much else, was out of time.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13385-kid-a-special-collectors-edition/,Capitol,2009.0
293,Florence and the Machine,Lungs,Pop/R&B,7.2,August 13 2009,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"More than any of this year's Radio 1-approved UK pop ingenues-- including the likes of electro-bots Little Boots and La Roux-- Florence Welch marks a clear break from the contentious-yet-fruitful Lily vs. Amy era. And that's not only because this self-professed ""real geek"" is a redhead who'll take harps over horns. Whereas Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse worked their way through the tabloids while breaking down life's troublesome bits into startlingly candid profundity on record, Welch aims for little but the outer reaches on her debut LP, Lungs. Welch hovers high above her native London's seedy back alleys-- and she's looking skyward. For this glittery free spirit, matters of the heart aren't simple, everyday occurrences-- they're as grand and mysterious as the big bang itself. ""The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out/ You left me in the dark,"" wails Welch on the audaciously huge ""Cosmic Love"". Lungs is a cloud-headed introduction to Welch's world, where It Girl hype, coffins, violence, and ambition combust on impact; it's a platinum-shellacked demo reel drunk on its own hi-fi-ness. Instead of giving this gothically pale 22-year-old with megaphone vox some classy pop-soul to work with Ã  la Duffy or Adele, Lungs takes the smorgasbord approach. Welch bursts mouth-wide over garage rock, epic soul, pint-tipping Britbeat, and-- best of all-- a mystic brand of pop that's part Annie Lennox, Grace Slick, and Joanna Newsom. A lesser talent might fall prey to such veering stylistic change-ups (cough, Kate Nash, cough), but Welch powers through, her ear-snapping alarm call of a voice making Lungs sound like the work of a courageous artist rather than a group of well-paid producers. Of course, well-paid producers are still involved-- specifically, James Ford (Simian Mobile Disco, Arctic Monkeys), Paul Epworth (Bloc Party), and Stephen Mackey (Pulp). Mackey is seemingly responsible for setting-up Welch's rock'n'roll bona fides, chalking up credits for the faux-shock White Stripes rip off ""Kiss With a Fist"" and the swinging and sinister ""Girl With One Eye"", which finds the singer in a gouging mood. Meanwhile, Ford and especially Epworth help their would-be star find a more unique sound that-- more often than not-- is overflowing with twinkling harps and breakup language writ large. Welch catapults off of Epworth's immense tribal drums on two of the record's finest, darkest opuses, ""Cosmic Love"" and the spooky stunner ""Blinding"". Ford's frothy, orchestrated style compliments Welch's theatrical bent on the swelling ""I'm Not Calling You a Liar"" and lilting single ""Dog Days Are Over"". Thanks to Welch's refreshingly immodest talent and vocal abilities, she not only conquers but thrives on the myriad bells and bobs pitched her way by her equally showy producers. ""Seems that I have been held in some dreaming state/ A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake,"" begins Welch on ""Blinding"". The song is about Welch's desire to put her girlish dreams away and face reality, but it conjures a place that's frightfully untouchable all the same. When notions of big-budget music become increasingly rare and name-brand artists are giving fans intimate concerts from their bedrooms via YouTube, Florence Welch's zeal for all things bright and/or shiny comes off as its own act of rebel defiance. Coming to her senses isn't an option.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13372-lungs/,Island,2009.0
294,David Bowie,VH1 Storytellers,Rock,4.5,July 15 2009,Patrick Sisson,Contributor,"""Oh you don't know the half of it."" Said in an over-the-top manner, this was David Bowie's inauspicious kick-off to an over-sentimental start to ""Life on Mars"". Like the rest of his 1999 performance on ""VH1's Storytellers"" series, it poses a question, or more accurately, suggests the audience will be privy to inside information. But the answers don't come during a mostly tepid eight-song set. Broadcast in August 1999, a quarter-century after he hung up his Ziggy Stardust kimonos, this episode teased fans with a rare chance to hear the shape-shifting artist discuss and deconstruct part of his mythology. Bowie was running on the fumes of what was a disappointing decade-- between albums like Earthling, Outside, and the then forthcoming Hours...-- but if anybody had an iconic back catalog, a colorful personal narrative (or narratives), and an amazing supporting cast to draw stories from, it was Bowie. Sadly, only flashes of his wit and gregarious storytelling come out during this CD/DVD release of his television performance. Standing at the center of what looks like a bad community theater stage set, entertaining an overly polite audience while donning a gray hoodie, Bowie comes off likable and very off the cuff. Take his introduction to ""China Girl"". After a hushed retelling of a story about a story-- Iggy Pop, over coffee, recalling a 1970s Berlin punk show where German artists built and destroyed a replica of the Berlin Wall-- he says, ""this is a song I wrote with Jim at around that time, and I guess this one's also about invasion and exploitation, take it away, Mike."" There's no mention or insight into Nile Rodgers, the Nazi reference in the song, or the then-controversial, award-winning music video-- just a somewhat interesting little tale followed by a piano intro better suited to some low-budget made-for-TV movie. His storytelling continues in this vein, jumping between the Paul Anka connection to ""Life on Mars"", an Eartha Kitt obsession and the shocking admission that the mid-70s was a dark, drug-fueled period impervious to recall. What's especially frustrating is that he's charming and self-deprecating, tossing out casual references to a meeting with Abbie Hoffmann and doing an amusing Marc Bolan impression, suggesting he could actually tell dozens more interesting, relevant, and revealing stories if he felt like it. Musically, things don't go much better, occasionally sliding into cheesy, cabaret-lite renditions from a band that looks like a casting call for session player stereotypes. Two of the tracks on the original broadcast, along with two more of the bonus tracks on the DVD, come from Hours..., not many fans' first choice. Two of the extra tracks, ""Always Crashing in the Same Car"" and ""I Can't Read"", provide a slightly more-well rounded look at his career, but none come with additional commentary, making them four modest live performances, nothing else. It's part of the puzzling DVD/CD element of this release. A DVD with a companion CD that doesn't bother to separate the songs from storytelling or include the bonus tracks makes it an audio recording of a television episode. Don't major labels have enough problems with venerable and archaic media formats without working hard to invent new ones? The substance of this reissue seems indebted to a famous name instead of adding significantly more insight into a famous and intriguing career. It's hard to imagine a fan outcry for a DVD filled with decent to muddled performances.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13202-vh1-storytellers/,"Virgin,EMI",2009.0
295,Wu-Tang Clan,Wu-Tang Chamber Music,Rap,7.5,July 6 2009,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"First things first: Wu-Tang Chamber Music is not a Wu-Tang Clan album, despite the presence of that W logo on the cover. About half the verses on the album come not from Wu members but from fellow Carhartt-era rap vets like Sean Price and Cormega. I guess Old 90s Rap Dudes Chamber Music didn't have the same ring. There's no Method Man, no GZA. RZA doesn't produce any beats, though we do hear his voice over and over. Second: Wu-Tang Chamber Music is only barely an album. Of the 17 tracks on the CD, only eight are actual songs; the rest are strictly interstitial pieces, kung-fu movie samples, or bits of marble-mouthed mythology already familiar to anyone who read The Wu-Tang Manual. And make no mistake: People who read The Wu-Tang Manual are definitely the target audience here. The mere existence of this LP has a weird late-90s quality to it; it's a throwback to the time when record-store shelves were crammed with with albums by vaguely Wu-affiliated crews like Killarmy and Sunz of Man, when labels would rush out any old crap they could slap that W logo on. A decade on, it's oddly comforting that a label would aim for your Wu-Tang consumer dollar even when that dollar barely exists anymore. But if Wu-Tang Chamber Music is a hackneyed cash-grab, it's a pretty good hackneyed cash grab. Because once you get past the brevity and the non-Wuness of it all, there is some beautifully executed hardhead grown-folks rap shit on here. The music comes from the Brooklyn soul band the Revelations, who do live-band rap music as well as just about anyone, which is to say that you can't tell you're hearing a live band most of the time. There's an organic old-soul crackle to the incendiary trumpet-bursts on ""Sound the Horns"" or the slow-rolling bassline on ""Ill Figures"", but that warmth is the sort of warmth that the better East Coast producers can get out of old records. And so credit might be due to Fizzy Womack, otherwise known as M.O.P.'s Lil Fame, probably the best beatmaker currently working the underground NYC circuit. Fizzy co-produced every actual song on the album, and these tracks have a hard-hitting simplicity that probably serves a quickie all-posse album like this one better than RZA's choked paranoia would. And because the Revelations play music even during the interludes, those bits never fuck up the flow of the album. And it certainly helps that most of the craggy veterans here, Wu and otherwise, go in hard on this thing. Most of these songs don't have actual choruses, so gnarled shit-talk is the focus here, and the assembled old gods still do it well. On ""Ill Figures"", Kool G Rap does twisted-up, lispy, half-off-beat gun-talk so well that you'd probably guess he'd been doing it for decades even if you didn't know. Inspectah Deck, on ""Sound the Horns"", comes with easily one of the top five C. Thomas Howell name-checks I've ever heard on a rap song: ""The sound of the horns says it's on / We storm through like C. Thomas, Red Dawn."" (""P. Swayze"" would've fit in just as well there, but Deck never goes the obvious route.) Cormega remains one of the only rappers who can get away with a line about ""lyrical elevation causes mental stimulation"" because he throws that in the middle of a verse so jammed with internal rhymes and left turns (""this is a lyrical aqueduct""?) that you only barely notice. Even RZA, never a great rapper, comes with at least one hot line: ""My moms put gunpowder inside my Similac."" And in his three appearances here, Ghostface Killah maintains his status as Wu-Tang's MVP, ranting about the shrooms on his tour rider on ""Harbor Masters"" or kicking unbelievably badass warnings on ""Evil Deeds"": ""Don't ever come at me sideways, hands in ya pocket/ Cuz I will turn to Steven Seagal, rip ya arm out ya socket."" But Ghostface's highlight, and the album's, comes on ""I Wish You Were Here"", the one moment of tenderness in the midst of all those boxcutter threats. Over a slow, quavery soul-jam beat, Ghost bleats out one of those emotive sex-rap verses that he does better than anyone else before ceding the spotlight to a raspy old-school soul clinic from singer Tre Williams, who comes off like Gerald Alston on 8 Diagrams' ""Stick Me for My Riches"". So, OK, the various rappers here can lay on the get-off-my-lawn stuff a little thick. (Topics railed against include Hot 97's Summer Jam, skinny jeans, Twitter, and the ever-popular ""ringtone rappers"".) And there's really no compelling reason for this LP to exist beyond these guys' desire to remind us that they're alive. But I haven't heard an album full of anachronistic tough-guy stuff this satisfying in a long time. The world may have moved on to songs with the word ""swag"" in the title, but these guys are still out there, spitting grown-man gangsterisms to anyone who will listen. I call that nobility.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13242-wu-tang-chamber-music-vol-1/,E1,2009.0
296,Isaac Hayes,Hot Buttered Soul,Pop/R&B,9.2,June 29 2009,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Think about how crazy this is for a moment: Stax loses Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays to a plane crash and the rights to their back catalog (and, later, Sam & Dave) to Atlantic. Without their biggest stars and their best session group, Stax executive Al Bell takes a desperate but necessary gamble: in an attempt to build an entirely new catalog out of scratch, he schedules dozens of all-new albums and singles to be recorded and released en masse over the course of a few months. And out of all of those records, the album that puts the label back on the map is a followup to a chart dud, recorded by a songwriter/producer who wasn't typically known for singing, where three of its four songs run over nine and a half minutes. And this album sells a million copies. If it weren't for the New York Mets, Isaac Hayes' Hot Buttered Soul would be the most unlikely comeback story of 1969. Since then, the album's had an odd reevaluation process: it hit #8 on the pop charts and #1 on the R&B charts, but also hit #1 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart-- which alarmed partisans of Miles Davis and Sly Stone alike. After another couple of albums in its crossover-friendly, string-drenched vein, Rolling Stone declared Isaac Hayes an enemy of all that was good about soul music in the early 1970s; decades later, a generation reared on hip-hop reverse-engineered the beats on Pac's ""Me Against the World"" or PE's ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"" and discovered an original brilliance. Now, after a listen to this new reissue 40 years later, Hot Buttered Soul might still seem a little historically counterintuitive. It stood as a newer, funkier phase of Southern soul, but it hinged on a sound more opulent than the most sharp-suited Motown crossover bid. It's an exercise in melodrama and indulgence that lays it on so heavy it's impossible not to hear it as anything but the stone truth. And it's an album whose edited-down singles-- both of which went top 40 pop-- sounded more like trailers for the real thing. (Said single edits are included here and can be safely ignored.) Yet the success of Hot Buttered Soul owed a bit to a classic crossover formula: start with an easy-listening-friendly pop staple, keep the orchestral sweetness, but layer on a shining veneer of psychedelic R&B, then stretch it out with some soul-jazz vamping and nail it down with a voice that hits like a velvet sledgehammer. Hayes demanded full creative control for this album, and his auteurism resulted in a luxurious rawness that soul artists would scramble to catch up with for years. It wasn't exactly an unprecedented sound, however, and in its own extravagant way Hot Buttered Soul might be to the end of the 60s what Ray Charles' Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music was seven years previous: an album that redrew the parameters for R&B's high-class populism. It's just that it hadn't been quite this audacious before-- not to the extent of Hayes' cover of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", all 18-plus sprawling minutes of it. Here we have a song that turns the idea of a slow build into something monumental: with a monologue he developed as a way to get apathetic club patrons to pay attention to where he was about to go, Hayes spends the first eight and a half minutes actually setting the stage for the scenario behind the song, from the wife's cavalier attitude and how the husband caught her cheating to the specific year and make of car he finally drove off for good in (a '65 Ford). It should be noted that all this time the band's been churning along with this hypnotic, minimalist swaying organ/bass/hi-hat drone that changes imperceptibly if at all; again, this is eight and a half minutes here. And when it finally does transition from Hayes' conversational murmur to the first actual sung line from the Jimmy Webb composition he's covering, it's the beginning of a metamorphosis that gradually transforms the dynamic of the song from sweet-stringed orchestration into full-fledged, brass-packed, explosively-cresting soul. But where ""Phoenix"" is all slow build, the album-opening version of ""Walk on By"" throws almost everything it has at you right away, nailing you to the floor with those first two drumbeats. Hayes takes the restrained sorrow of Bacharach and David's composition as made famous by Dionne Warwick and chucks it out the window, replacing it with an arrangement that is the absolute antithesis of hiding the tears and sadness and grieving in private. And it's goddamned devastating at every turn: its go-for-broke opening, with those weeping strings and that stinging guitar building to their gigantic crescendo; that moment when it collapses and sinks into Michael Toles' famous slinky guitar riff, which then warps its way into psychedelic keening more Hendrix than Cropper; every hitch and moan and heart-wracked ad-lib from Hayes' deep bass voice (""you put the hurt on me, you socked it to me, mama""). The entire last half of the song's twelve minutes is an exercise in seeing just how long you can not only maintain but build on a frenzied finale, where Toles' guitar sounds like it's ripping itself apart and Hayes' Hammond organ trembles and growls and stammers like a panicking tiger. It might be the most intense six minutes of soul recorded in the confines of a studio the entire decade. The remainder of Hot Buttered Soul isn't quite as ambitiously excessive, though the other two songs still have an indelible presence. Hayes' version of Charles Chalmers' and Sandra Rhodes' ""One Woman"" is affecting if short-- ""short"" in this case meaning a hair over five minutes. As breathers go, it works wonders in proving Hayes' way with a mellow ballad could still have an emotional impact in a more confined space. And Hayes' sole songwriting credit is the linguistically convoluted masterpiece ""Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic,"" a straight-up slick-as-hell funk jam which gets a lot of mileage out of humorously-deployed latin phrases and five-dollar words (""My gastronomical stupensity is really satisfied when you're loving me""). Even if it's his only lyrical contribution, he subsequently if unintentionally caricaturizes the ornate but down-to-earth personality of the entire album: it's all self-consciously complicated, but man, the meaning's right there in front of you. And it can't help but hit you right where you feel it.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13233-hot-buttered-soul/,Stax,2009.0
297,Miles Davis,Sketches of Spain: Legacy Edition,Jazz,8.0,June 5 2009,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Is this even jazz? Sketches of Spain was perhaps the first Miles Davis album to inspire this question, though it certainly wouldn't be the last. Originally released in 1960, it was Davis' studio follow-up to the landmark Kind of Blue, and it found him, yet again, striking out in an entirely new direction. Working with arranger Gil Evans, Davis cooked up a concept album, looking to the structure and texture of Spanish folk and classical music for inspiration. The two old friends and collaborators were on a huge roll creatively during this period. Davis was piling up hall of fame-caliber jazz albums with alarming regularity, while Evans, in addition to working with Davis frequently in the late 1950s, recorded what was perhaps his finest solo album in 1960, Out of the Cool (it vaguely shares a vibe with Sketches, but is in my estimation just a hair better). So to say both were in strong form here would be an understatement. Davis takes what is most striking about his trumpet style-- the controlled soloing in the middle register, with a mastery of subtle shifts in focus-- and amplifies it, creating measured phrases of almost painful intensity. While Evans' distinctive approach to harmony and tonal color-- one of the most enjoyable ""Hey, I get it!"" moments as you first explore jazz is when you start to recognize his arrangements-- inhabits a form that to the uninitiated can sound mysterious and exotic and sensual. It's hard not to be taken in immediately. And that's the first thing to note about Sketches of Spain: Where Davis' ""Is this jazz?"" albums from the late-60s forward were often dense and challenging (""Is this even music?"" even came up now and then), Sketches of Spain was always easy to like. So much so that, like its predecessor, it became the kind of record that someone with only two or three albums by jazz artists might have in their collection. That's partly up to its potential contexts being so variable. There's a lot going on in the music that rewards a close listen, but it's also something you can put on and read to (though admittedly, some of the dynamic surges could be a little jolting). It's often quiet and atmospheric, at points coming over as almost ambient. It's the kind of album that dims the light in the room whenever it plays. It's also absolutely gorgeous. The writers of The Penguin Guide to Jazz felt that the moodiness of Sketches of Spain dominated to the point where it added up to something closer to glorified elevator music. There is some merit to their claim, but the criticism now seems, interestingly, dated. The majority of people encountering a record like Sketches of Spain for the first time probably have no special interest in jazz as an idea, and the notion of pursuing atmospheric records whose primary selling point is an overriding feel and an abiding surface-level prettiness is nothing to be embarrassed about. If we want something more forward with more improvisation and interplay, hey, there are a billion other records out there. But Sketches of Spain does something special. There's a real charge that comes from the distant, clattering percussion that begins ""Concierto de Aranjuez (Adagio)"", the opening track and centerpiece. It's a piece by Spanish composer JoaquÃ­n Rodrigo, and if you hear it played with a classical guitar and full orchestra, you realize both how faithful Evans was to it in terms of structure and what he accomplished as far as texture. Using French horn, harp, oboe, and bassoon, as well as more typically jazz brass instruments like trumpet and trombone (Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb, the rhythm section of Davis' band, are both on hand, but they're playing charts-- there's no room here for improvisation), Evans creates a shifting tapestry of luscious sound. Sometimes the music just seems to hang in the air, and sometimes it lurches toward an unexpected climax. Davis is the only soloist on the record, and he burrows deeply into the melodies, turning them over with a huge, bulbous tone that's both strong and vulnerable. He sounds especially impassioned on ""Saeta"", a piece whose scales reflect the influence of North African music on flamenco. It opens with a march and a fanfare, and then Davis blasts an uncanny solo-- slow, choosing between a small handful of notes, but so intent and concentrated that his trumpet almost seems to be splintering. The contrasts between Evans velvety but complex backdrops and Davis' extemporaneous work out front is compelling from start to finish. The problem with this edition is a familiar one to anyone who has followed the never-ending Miles Davis reissue campaign: There's an extra disc of material here, all of which was issued elsewhere and most of which is of interest primarily to collectors, and that extra disc inflates the suggested retail of the set to $25. That's a lot of scratch when you get down to what you're really paying for if you don't own the set already, and that's the first five tracks from the original record, 41 minutes of music total. Disc One, in addition to the full album, does contain the sessions' one true outtake, ""Song of Our Country"". It's easy to see why it was left off, since its tone is several shades brighter and the arrangement is more firmly entrenched in jazz proper-- it actually sounds closer to something from Miles Ahead, the 1957 Evans/Davis big band set. But it's still worth owning, even if it was later compiled into one of Davis' many odds-and-ends sets, 1980's Directions. Eight of the 11 tracks on the second disc consist of alternate takes, including four that cover sections of ""Concierto"". As good as some of this material is, you'll never reach for this sequence over the master unless you're researching the subtle differences in the solos. A live version of ""Concierto"" from 1961, the only time Davis performed this material in concert, is the most worthwhile inclusion by far. But by the end of the disc we're hearing ""Teo"" from the 1961 album Someday My Prince Will Come, and all of a sudden Coltrane is soloing, which makes no sense whatsoever in this painstakingly arranged context. As the notes indicate, ""Teo"" bears a melodic and thematic resemblance to material on Sketches, and though that's true, its inclusion here is dubious. It seems more a way to pad out a set that needs to be of a certain length to justify the price tag. Better that this edition had included ""Song of Our Country"" and the live ""Concierto"" as bonus cuts on a single disc. The liner notes, by composer Gunther Schuller, a ""Third Stream"" pioneer who mixed jazz and classical, are informative and well done and do add value. The music benefits from his analysis, which is technical but still accessible. So the score given here reflects a compromise between the vast musical riches of the original album and the questionable packaging of the reissue. I wish I could say that Sketches is an album that turntable owners should just seek out on inexpensive used vinyl-- with a jazz record this popular, there are plenty of copies floating around. But the music is so subtle and detailed, surface noise really can get in the way here. Sketches is a masterpiece that opens up with a close listen, with every detail of the music clearly audible. So do seek it out, but if you do so with this edition, it'll cost you a few bucks.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13088-sketches-of-spain-legacy-edition/,Legacy,2009.0
298,James Brown,"The Singles, Vol. 7: 1970-1972",Rock,8.6,June 4 2009,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"On March 9, 1970, James Brown's band blew up, and it was arguably the best thing that ever happened to him. Hours before a show in Columbus, Georgia, they threatened to quit unless they got better pay and better treatment; Soul Brother #1 fired them and flew in the Pacemakers, a bunch of teenagers from Cincinnati who knew his songs as well as any other funk band in those days. In fact, they were the first band he'd played with who'd grown up on funk, and they included a pair of world-class musicians-- guitarist Phelps ""Catfish"" Collins and his bassist brother William ""Bootsy"" Collins. For the next year, Brown's flame burned even hotter than it ever had before or would again. The string of classic singles that band recorded are all included here, beginning with ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"". Banged out in two takes in a late-night studio visit a mere six weeks after that Columbus gig, it's a funk firebomb that would've defined anyone else's career and was just another hit for Brown. Within the year, they also cut ""Super Bad"" (whose squalling, free-jazz-inspired sax solo by Robert McCullough seemed unthinkable as part of a dance record until JB pulled it off), ""Soul Power"", ""Talking Loud and Saying Nothing"" and a hurtling, screaming freakout called ""Get Up, Get Into It, and Get Involved"", all of them massive hits. By this point, Brown had mostly abandoned songs-as-we-know-them, although he did release a ballad called ""I Cried"" that he'd written for Tammy Montgomery in the early 60s, as well as a duet with Lyn Collins on his own oldie ""Just Won't Do Right"". The new band's formula was single-chord riffs (and maybe a bridge on the subdominant), fantastically tricky grids of rhythms and horns, and a couple of hook phrases, sometimes traded with former Famous Flame Bobby Byrd (that's him yelling the ""get on up"" part of ""Sex Machine""). That's all they needed. Brown had always thrived on the spontaneity of his live show, and his new style let him fly as freely on record as he did on stage. Almost all of his early-70s hits have moments that give off the heat of creation in the instant. The loping hard-funk version of ""Talking Loud and Saying Nothing"" features JB yelling to engineer Ron Lenhoff to ""keep the tape running"" as he decides in the middle of the take to add its spectacular a cappella breakdown. ""Escape-Ism"" wasn't even a composition before it was a recording-- it was a warmup jam that Lenhoff thought to record (with another new lineup, which had at that point been together for barely two weeks under the direction of trombonist Fred Wesley), and it went Top 10 on the R&B charts. The new crop of musicians who joined up in early 1971 weren't nearly as virtuosic as the Collins brothers (memorable quote from the liner notes, on ""Make It Funky"": ""Second guitarist Robert Coleman deserves a nod for sticking with his humble three notes and staying out of the way""). Fortunately, Wesley was a brilliant bandleader who knew how to make a lot out of a little. ""Hot Pants"", the four-part ""Make It Funky"" (released as two consecutive singles), and ""I'm a Greedy Man"" are all juggernaut dance records that turn out, on inspection, to be constructed out of fairly simple components. As with every volume of this mail-order-only series, Brown's lapses in taste are revealed a few times, although there aren't many on this set-- a pair of ludicrous Christmas singles and an instrumental cover of Blood, Sweat & Tears' ""Spinning Wheel"". Also, Hip-O's completist approach to including every alternate mix that hit airwaves or stores, as well as Brown's habit of splitting songs over 45 sides, means that we get multiple consecutive versions of a lot of titles: the two discs' 39 tracks represent 15 songs (and a funny/sad anti-drug PSA). But it's hard to object to hearing ""Soul Power"" or ""Sex Machine"" a few times in a row.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13091-the-singles-vol-7-1970-1972/,Hip-O Select,2009.0
299,My Morning Jacket,Celebración de la Ciudad Natal,Rock,6.0,May 1 2009,Joshua Klein,,"My Morning Jacket may have made the leap from an under-the-radar indie outfit to virtually the only jam band with hipster cred, but as far as they have grown from their roots, MMJ haven't forgotten where they came from. Case in point: To support and celebrate this past Record Store Day, My Morning Jacket released Celebración de la Ciudad Natal, a double live 10"" exclusive recorded in both Louisville's indie record shop ear X-tacy as well as during a three-hour set at the city's Waterfront Park. Even the title tips its hat to the group's Kentucky stomping grounds, translating to ""celebrating the city of my birth."" The music itself showcases the group in fine form, which is to be expected. Even those who grumble at their perceived fumbles will concede that My Morning Jacket remain a force to be reckoned with on stage. From the (more or less) straight Southern rock of ""Evil Urges"" to the dubious Cameo nod ""Highly Suspicious"" and the folk-country of ""Librarian"", songs from last year's Evil Urges benefit from the extra breathing space provided by a live airing. ""Gideon"" gets to drop some atmospherics and gain in sharpness, while fellow Z track ""Dondante"" is doubled in length to over 14 minutes, demonstrating the qualities that make the group such a live draw. The band also revisits ""Phone Went West"" (from At Dawn) and performs ""Where to Begin"", its contribution to the Elizabethtown soundtrack (all 10 people who caught the Cameron Crowe flop may recall it was set in Kentucky). Yet Celebración de la Ciudad Natal is less valuable for the music than for the message it sends. ""I've been buying records at ear X-tacy since I was a tadpole,"" says Jim James on the release. ""I think the thing that people forget about is the community and the memories that are created when you come to an independent and locally owned record store that you can only get in that town."" It used to be that release day was also often the first chance you had to hear a band's new material, and divisive albums like My Morning Jacket's Evil Urges (released the day of the June 2008 ear X-tacy appearance) still had the power to shock and/or surprise you. Sadly, for many the record store is now an afterthought, the end point after days, weeks, or even months of circulated leaks that leech each new release of its dramatic impact. It's debatable how much else has actually been lost along with those once-formative listening experiences, but certainly the sense of community James toasts has at least changed. Would My Morning Jacket have graduated to their current level without that initial surge of grassroots word-of-mouth indie support? Maybe. But one imagines the way they got there would have been quite different, and perhaps less forgiving of an upstart act finding its way forward. Consider, then, Celebración de la Ciudad Natal as a sort of testament to the intangible, a reminder of the long gone thrill when Record Store Day came every week.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12968-celebracion-de-la-ciudad-natal/,ATO,2009.0
300,Depeche Mode,Sounds of the Universe,"Electronic,Rock",6.3,April 22 2009,Joshua Klein,,"""They're a singles band,"" sniffed a friend, dismissing Depeche Mode's influential career. Even if one were to agree with that blithe assessment, there's no way Depeche Mode could be dismissed as just a singles band, given their track record on the charts and in the clubs, a string of hits that have hung in there to varying degrees of ubiquity. Sure, the singles sometimes remain standouts, but the rest of the tracks-- especially on albums like Music for the Masses and Violator-- are hardly filler. For better or for worse-- and those who miss the band's more subversive early days may think it's for the worse-- Depeche Mode have gotten in the habit of crafting complete start-to-finish statements. Yet it's still unclear where Depeche Mode fits into today's pop world. The group is currently selling out stadiums around the globe, which attests to its ongoing popularity, and unlike many other acts of its vintage still manages to attract fans that span demographics. But Depeche Mode are also a far cry from the pioneers they once were, let alone the leaders they grew to become. It's almost as if the band has stepped aside to a parallel track, content in its place; more cachet, more cool, more money-- they'll take it if they can get it, but they sure don't need it. So, yes, the days of earth-quaking, Zeitgeist-shifting Depeche Mode awesomeness may likely be behind them, but that doesn't make Sounds of the Universe any less worthy of the band's legacy. If the album as usual seems to have little or no bearing on anything outside the group's own, um, universe, the wheels and gears are definitely still turning and churning in the Depeche Mode machine. Martin Gore can still be counted on to deliver the goods, and recent songwriting convert Dave Gahan is impatiently nipping at his heels. Gahan's singing, meanwhile, is as strong as ever, always the perfect vehicle for Gore's lyrics, and the glue that holds together even the disc's most diffuse songs. And really, Sounds of the Universe is, at 60 minutes and 13 songs-- the group's longest player to date-- relatively loose and sprawling, as likely to drift as hit hard. While the group's brought back producer Ben Hillier, Sounds of the Universe is a very different album from its predecessor, Playing the Angel. ""In Chains"" begins like how one imagines it would feel to be on the receiving end of a SETI signal before stretching into an epic-- satisfyingly dramatic and dynamic despite its leisurely seven-minute gait-- and deceptively full of activity despite what feels like an intentional ear for minimalism. ""Hole to Feed"", a Gahan composition, is similarly busy yet spare, bounding along a sci-fi take on the Bo Diddley beat while Gahan (his troubled history public record) draws on double meanings and innuendo to project the band's trademark narcissistic portent. The song doesn't know how to end, but that just makes the entrance of ""Wrong"" that much more theatrical. That song-- the single-- is short but deliciously sour, hearkening back to the band's synthier days without losing the layer of grunge it's carefully cultivated post-Violator, a strategy also reflected by ""Fragile Tension"" (which wouldn't have been out of place on the generally noisier Angel). ""Little Soul"" and ""In Sympathy"", however, once again echo old-school minimalist Depeche menace and pop smarts, respectively, which makes ""Peace""-- sounding like Kraftwerk gone dreamy gospel-- that much more striking. It's a stirring encapsulation of all of Depeche Mode's different sides and qualities, reminiscent of all those other great album tracks lurking throughout the group's catalog. Yet a funny thing happens next. With the strong but still oddly static Gahan composition ""Come Back"", the album starts to feel a little fractured, and by the time the effortlessly melodic ""Perfect"" comes around, followed by the casually industrial ""Miles Away/The Truth Is"", the synth-lounge ""Jezebel"", and the fuzzy closer ""Corrupt"", it's almost as if we've embarked on another album entirely. Either that or the band's simply left us to find our way through their space. Ending with a brief, queasy reprise tease of ""Wrong"", Sounds of the Universe concludes anticlimactically, an echo of its promising start.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12940-sounds-of-the-universe/,"Mute,Capitol",2009.0
301,Radiohead,Pablo Honey: Collector's Edition,Rock,5.4,April 16 2009,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"When Capitol released a few different shortcuts through Radiohead's career late last year, we were indifferent to its cause, citing a lack of need and poor selection. Most fervent Radiohead fans would have wasted their money buying these packages, and most people interested in the band would be best served by their actual albums. Well, Capitol has now begun to roll out those parent albums-- starting with the group's three 1990s releases (Pablo Honey, The Bends, OK Computer)-- again, without the band's participation. This time, however, the label is doing it right, dressing the releases up with the right accoutrements: B-sides from the era (and since the era overlapped with two-part CD singles, there are plenty), radio sessions, and music videos. For an epochal, era-defining band, Radiohead had an unusual beginning, looking like they'd wind up one-hit wonders, chancers callously attaching themselves to a sound and moment yet with few ideas of their own. That first hit, ""Creep"", with its loud/soft dynamic and self-loathing lyric, fit snugly into the post-Nirvana alt-rock landscape-- no surprise: Radiohead copped as much from 80s indie rock as their Pac NW brethren did. Yet instead of being hamstrung by platinum success, Radiohead abandoned careerist moves for artistic ambitions, moving quickly to incorporate the record-collector's music of post-rock and Mo Wax, the post-dance, spiritually nurturing end of UK rock, and the pre-millennial tension of IDM and trip-hop. By the end of the 90s, Radiohead hadn't supplanted U2, R.E.M., Oasis, and Metallica as the world's biggest rock band. But it was largely agreed upon that they were the world's best-- and with hindsight, arguably, along with the White Stripes, the last indie-friendly group to conquer the world and punch in the same weight class as early 90s alt-rock giants like Nine Inch Nails, Pearl Jam, Green Day, or Red Hot Chili Peppers. That they used this critical and commercial currency to such dazzling effect on Kid A and Amnesiac is still one of the highlights of this decade; that the press, especially in the UK, chose the more familiar and necrophiliac ""new rock revolution"" over the relatively pioneering Radiohead is one of the decade's lows. UK rock, for all its heady artistry and visionaries throughout the 60s, 70s, and 80s, had been slumming it a bit when Radiohead first emerged. Size and grandeur, which would become the goals for too many UK guitar bands by the end of the Britpop era, were largely missing from that country's indie scene when Radiohead started recording in 1992. Sure, the Stone Roses had trumpeted their own greatness a few years earlier, but most of the era's indie music was introspective, bands content to gaze at their shoes rather than aim for the back of the venue. Radiohead's early, full-bodied music was, in most circles then, dismissed as empty Americanisms-- and not without reason. The expansive Pablo Honey set-- the 12-song album accompanied by 22 extras-- mostly highlights a group in hock to U.S. indie heroes Pixes and Dinosaur Jr. (with the occasional R.E.M. homage tossed in-- see: ""Lurgee""). The loose ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" and delicate ""Thinking About You"" thankfully break up the 120-minute mood, but most of the rest of the album is squarely in the post-grunge wheelhouse. That's not always a bad thing: ""Stop Whispering"", opener ""You"", and a re-recorded version of early single ""Prove Yourself"" hold up well-- and ""Creep"" has oddly gotten better with age. Elsewhere, the dreadful ""Pop Is Dead"", and songs like ""How Do You?"", ""I Can't"", ""Ripcord"", and ""Vegetable"" are run of the mill at best. If Pablo Honey didn't betray hints of the band Radiohead would become, neither did its B-sides. Unlike contemporaries such as Blur, who used their non-album material to explore new ideas or moods, Radiohead's Pablo Honey-era work is primarily lesser versions of the album. The extra material kicks off with their debut release, the Drill EP, which features three rudimentary versions of LP tracks, plus ""Stupid Car"", the first of Thom Yorke's odd automobile-themed fixations (still to come: ""Killer Cars"", ""Airbag"", the ""Karma Police"" video...) From there, it's a mishmash of alternate takes and also-rans (highlight: the U.S. single version of ""Stop Whispering""), with only the shoegazey ""Coke Babies"" and an acoustic version of early political commentary ""Banana Co."" (released in much better form on The Bends package) worth exploring more than a few times. I distinctly remember then the first time someone suggested The Bends was a great record. Not being one of the million-plus Pablo Honey owners at the time, I was content to hear ""Creep"" on the radio over and over and expected I'd soon spend about as much about time with Radiohead's catalog as one would with, say, Hum or Ned's Atomic Dustbin or School of Fish. The My Iron Lung EP had beaten The Bends to U.S. record shelves by a few months, and the ""High and Dry"" / ""Planet Telex"" single was out a few weeks prior as well, but few noticed. Anyone who had explored those two earlier singles, however, would have been excited for the LP. A reaction to the success of ""Creep"", ""My Iron Lung"" found Radiohead still exploring the loud/soft dynamic, but guitarist Jonny Greenwood was also locating his own identity and Yorke, inspired by Jeff Buckley, was using a wider vocal range, including some falsetto. Balancing a slightly artier sense of musical self-destruction with a sinewy guitar line, on ""Lung"" Radiohead found new ways to pick apart and re-construct the typical alt-rock template. Elsewhere on the EP, the five B-sides demonstrated a band whose collective heads seemed to crack open and spill out new ideas, moving the group away from the dour dead-end of grunge signifiers: With more loose-limbed and nimble guitar work (""The Trickster""), hints of art-rock (""Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong""), the valuing of texture over riffs (""Permanent Daygliht""), offers of emotional nourishment (""Lozenge of Love"" and ""You Never Wash Up After Yourself"") and tension and apprehension about workaday life (""Lewis [Mistreated]""), and themes of misanthropy (um, most of the five songs), these tracks pointed the way toward what was to come. The band's next release, the ""High and Dry"" / ""Planet Telex"" single, announced that they'd arrived. ""Planet Telex"", an early exploration with loops and studio enhancements for the group, is their first song that could have fit on any of their albums, regardless of how experimental they grew; ""High and Dry"", meanwhile, is the blueprint for the big-hearted balladry that spawned the careers of imitators Travis, Starsailor, Elbow, and Coldplay (who, let's face it, wound up perfecting this sort of huggable, swelling arena rock). The Bends was essentially split between these poles: warmth and tension; riffs and texture; rock and post-rock. The tricks employed by ""Planet Telex"" were rarely bested on it-- only arguably by ""Just""-- while the ""High & Dry"" version of the band was topped at every turn here, especially on ""Street Spirit (Fade Out"") and ""Fake Plastic Trees"". Even B-sides such ""Bishop's Robes"" and ""Talk Show Host"" come close to matching ""High"". To many fans, this more approachable and loveable version of the band is its peak. I can't agree, but the record is still a marvel. It feels, with hindsight, like a welcome retreat from the incessant back-patting and 60s worship of prime-period Britpop and a blueprint for the more feminine, emotionally engaging music that would emerge in the UK a few years later-- led by OK Computer. Alongside late 1996 or 1997 releases by Verve, Spiritualized, Belle and Sebastian, Cornershop, Mogwai, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Primal Scream, Super Furry Animals, the Beta Band, Mansun, and even Britpop stars Blur, Radiohead's OK Computer led the push back against knuckle-dragging Oasis clones who segregated their Boomer rock leanings from the fertile explorations of dance, classic indie, hip-hop, and art-school sensibilities going on throughout the rest of the UK. But once again, the press chose what they knew over the new, and despite the plaudits for 2000's Kid A, by the time of 2001's Amnesiac, people wanted another The Bends. OK Computer was the balance everyone agreed upon though-- real songs and tunes, but ones that didn't shrink from the increasingly unlimited possibilities of modern music-making. In that sense, Radiohead were not only record-collectors but futurists, approaching the 21st century from the perspective of their day rather than from the generation prior, as Stereolab, Broadcast, Tortoise, and others were doing (to wonderful effect, granted). Discounting the breather ""Fitter Happier"", only ""Electrioneering"" seems like a misstep on the album today, with the white-knuckle ""Climbing Up the Walls"" and pre-album teaser ""Lucky"" now standing firmly alongside more entrenched highlights ""Paranoid Android"", ""No Surprises"", ""Karma Police"", and ""Let Down"". The record's B-sides are no less rewarding, especially ""Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2)"" and ""Melatonin"", which would have fit fine on LP itself. ""Palo Alto"" proves they could do light and tongue-in-cheek, while ""Meeting in the Aisle"" makes you wonder why they don't record more instrumentals. The group's eventual fascination with, for a successful 90s guitar band, relatively foreign sounds like IDM and 20th century classical music found root around this time and it's on these extras where they first explored these notions. Maybe you don't need to buy these again, maybe you own the material already. If you do, sure-- pass. If you have the LPs but stopped there, both The Bends and OK Computer are worth getting in these versions. If you're curious or a completist, Pablo Honey is out there, too. That the band had nothing to do with these is beside the point: This is the final word on these records, if for no other reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era. That all of those discs are coming out at the same time, rather than being slowly and ceremoniously rolled out as they were 20-odd years ago, is a tacit acknowledgment by the music industry that they best sell non-vinyl physical products now, immediately, before the prospect of doing so is gone. With that in mind, I find it wise that many bands are wisely re-organizing their pasts, or having it done for them by their label. So long as it's done like this, I'm happy to re-purchase the stuff.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/,"Capitol,Capitol,Capitol",2009.0
302,Prince,Lotusflow3r,"Pop/R&B,Rock",4.9,April 13 2009,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"For several days, Lotusflow3r/MPLSound sat on my hard drive, daring me to click play. I finally acquiesced, knowing this review was due, and suddenly realized how much my relationship with Prince has changed over the past 20 years. His rise to success, beginning with 1979's Prince, pretty much mirrored my pre-adolescent development as a music fan. By 1987's Sign O' the Times, I was ripping the cellophane off the cassingles when barely out of the store, hoping to soak up a little of that Princely aura even if it would be hours before I'd be near my tape deck. Like many who came of age when each new Prince album expanded our conception of pop, I've already struggled through plenty of self-cannibalized sketches and ever-more-mawkish ballads and unsuccessful experiments to locate the canon-worthy songs lurking in his decade-plus of hubristic over-production. I know a jumble of decent tunes, lackluster jams, and outright dreck invariably awaits on any Tuesday morning bearing a new Prince album. This time around, and in several key ways, we get a partial throwback to the Prince records I greedily inhaled as a tween. (For one thing I bought a physical copy at a chain department store, something I haven't regularly done since I could drive.) That added a little twist to my distress when I realized that, at age 31, I was actually kind of dreading my first play of a new Prince album. It's a future the 12-year-old me would not have wanted to reach. Assessing a new Prince album all but demands forced objectivity and willfully ignoring his first decade as a recording artist. Want to look like an idiot? Write a screed lamenting the fact that an artist has failed to consistently entertain, let alone surprise or enlighten, for over 30 years. But what's left, once you choose the road of sane detachment, other than a review that can be summed up as ""predictably imperfect, your mileage may vary""? Hence my low-level dread. So here's my hardly original thesis, which many could have guessed even before clicking: Don't buy this album unless you're willing to do the work of winnowing it down to the tracks you find enjoyable/passable. Two new Prince albums (plus a third disc we'll get to in a minute) for the price of one might as well come with a giant sparkly sticker that reads ""For Obsessive Amateur Editors Only."" Filler on a 21st century Prince album? Do purple pontiffs leave paisley piles in the Minnesota woods? Lotusflow3r is mostly neutral funk-rock. When I say ""funk-rock,"" I don't mean the taut, digitally enhanced amalgam Prince invented/perfected in the 1980s. I mean the looser variety, amenable to extended onstage takes, that friend and foe alike would describe as ""organic,"" albeit with very different inflections. It's a sound that works best when he observes three important guidelines: 1) He restrains the stock guitar heroics (has anyone's instrumental creativity been more effectively hampered by being repeatedly declared the last great virtuoso?), 2) He keeps the tempos club-friendly (or at least friendly in the context of old-school weekend at the 40-and-over spot), and 3) He remembers his faux rivalry with fellow funkateer Morris Day was more productive than his imagined rivalry with musically ignorant young folks. But when I say ""neutral,"" unfortunately I mean pretty much exactly what you probably think I mean. The only track with an immediately memorable hook is his cover of ""Crimson and Clover"", which would be sadder if he hadn't been obscuring his preternatural catchiness for some time now. On Lotusflow3r, as on all of his albums since he became a classicist by intent and a live workhorse out of necessity, Prince mistakenly assumes instrumental prowess to be of primary importance to anyone other than online guitar-tab traders, while also displaying an unflattering and near-constant need to prove he can hang with the multi-cultural heroes who shaped his worldview. There's no need to genuflect when you've long since been admitted to the pantheon. If Lotusflow3r is generic and too-reverential modern day muso Prince, then MPLSound is either crass or delusional. It's crass if it's a conceptual cash-grab, Prince bald-facedly pastiching his own 80s sound as a profitable parlor game. Times being vice-tight, presumably even for those with the renewable resource of a deep catalog of hall-of-fame hits, dusting off the drum machine makes a certain sad sense, and a by-numbers ballad like ""Here"" sounds undeniably better backed by its twee little keyboard hook than, like, a flute. It's delusional if he's serious, because it means he thinks these flimsy self-homages wouldn't sound anemic next to tunes from Purple Rain or Parade, which you can at least write off as the kind of perception-free baloney we expect from geniuses of his stripe. Either way, MPLSound is (surprise) momentarily enjoyable and completely inessential, happy to provoke Palovian responses since the hard work of honestly juicing your head, heart, or hips is antithetical to the whole idea. Sure, you can still sieve off a few decent tracks for your ""Prince in the Aughts"" playlist; the Camille redux of ""Dance 4 Me"" is my personal choice, if only because he tries to shoehorn in all of the sex/religion/androgyne clichés. But while I'd pick electro-funk Prince over jazz-funk Prince every day of the week, the proximity of Lotusflow3r makes the pleasures of MPLSound feel even more hollow, like it's merely a spoonful of synth-driven sugar designed to sell naysayers on the non-electronic new stuff Prince wants you to cherish as much as the old faves. Elixer, the aforemetioned third disc, is actually by newcomer Bria Valente, who should at least be happy she's been able to piggyback her way to bad reviews in national publications, rather than languishing in the promo bin purgatory to which she'd be consigned if her producer was a cousin with a copy of Pro Tools. Elixer runs the gamut of bland-but-classy R&B, from antiseptic slow jams to rote dance-pop, slick as you'd expect and completely failing to suggest what bunched Prince's panties when he initially discovered Valente. Many of Prince's pet projects have been little more than ventriloquist's dummies-- excepting skilled musicians like Sheila E. or irrepressible lunatics like Morris Day, the master hasn't had much patience for personality-driven showboats-- but any trace of weirdness or wit or actual eroticism has seemingly been purged from Valente's performance at Jehovah's request, which reflects worse on egomaniacal producer than nominal artiste in this case. Like some depressing footnote to the whole Lotusflow3r/MPLSound experience, Elixer sparked my final sad realization about my current relationship with Prince and his product: Who knew I'd one day get wistful for the vacuous but honestly carnal fluff of ""Sex Shooter""?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12911-lotusflow3r-mplsound-elixer/,"NPG,NPG,NPG",2009.0
303,Pearl Jam,Ten: Deluxe Edition,Rock,6.7,April 3 2009,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Ten may be classic rock today, but it's easy to underestimate how radical Pearl Jam sounded back in 1991, even with Nirvana ascendant. After several long years of hair metal dominance, here was a band that could jam stadium-large, texture their sound darkly and densely, and explode the blues-rock template. Here was a frontman with an entirely new stage presence, whose voice strained hard for sincerity and whose songwriting expressed grave self-reckoning without resorting to easy sentiments or self-glorifying choruses. Against the odds-- as well as against the band's wishes, apparently-- their debut became a phenomenon, an alt-rock figurehead as crucial as Nevermind in ushering in and defining the parameters for mainstream rock. Vedder's self-doubts ran as deep as Cobain's, but he expressed them bluntly and directly rather than poetically and obscurely. Oh and also, he's still alive. Deeply invested in the cathartic possibilities of punk and classic rock, Pearl Jam seemingly made music as a form of self-therapy, an idea that took hold with nearly a decade of alt-rock acts to come. The band is routinely blamed for the self-gratifying Stone Temple Pilots, Creeds, and Nicklebacks that followed Ten, but the band naturally never set out to remake rock music in its own image. Suspicious of the hedonism of the arena rock that preceded them, Pearl Jam were a solemn band, and Ten sounds nothing if not entirely serious about animating Vedder's self-doubts. At times, it's a bit overwrought (""I don't question our existence/ I just question our modern needs""), but the earnestness with which Vedder sang and the band played these songs belies the decade's reputation as a period of pervasive irony. Ultimately, the 1990s wouldn't have been so bad if Pearl Jam's followers hadn't aped their self-seriousness so relentlessly. Nevertheless, Ten remains impressive and occasionally moving 18 years later, even gentrified with a shiny reissue. The public perception of the album is watered down thanks mainly to the excision of ""Alive"", ""Jeremy"", and ""Even Flow"" as singles. The latter two may be the album's least remarkable tracks: ""Jeremy"" is the most pat Freudian psychodrama on an album full of them, and ""Evenflow"" romanticizes homelessness as spiritually transcendent. But ""Alive"" remains potent not only because Vedder touches on some seriously transgressive shit here (dead fathers, hints at incest, survivor guilt), but mostly because the band rock the hell out of that coda. Today, Ten lives and dies by its album tracks, and while there are a few clunkers, most are pretty ballsy in their disdain for expectations. Granted, as a new band with few realistic prospects for the kind of success they quickly achieved, Pearl Jam were working with a very different set of expectations than the ones retroactively assigned to them. On songs like ""Once"", with its insistent breakdowns, and ""Black"", with strangely dramatic vocalizations, there's a hardscrabble dynamic that the band would be unable to capture on subsequent releases. ""Why Go"" is ferocious in its outrage, with Vedder delivering his most pained vocals, and Stone Gossard and Mike McCready match him on every song, translating Vedder's howls into messy, edge-of-the-precipice solos and paint-peeling riffs like the one that anchors ""Deep"". In addition to the original album as produced by Rick Parashar and mixed by Tim Palmer, the new reissue includes a second disc, titled Ten Redux, that includes a new mix by Brendan O'Brien. A few of these new versions appeared on 2004's best-of Rearviewmirror, and O'Brien, who has worked with Pearl Jam on most of their subsequent albums, brings Vedder's ad libs to the forefront, sharpens some of the guitar riffs, and generally cleans up the murkiness. Sounding like 2005 rather than 1991, Ten Redux misses the point: The album's murkiness was one of its chief attractions, its flawed spontaneity feeding the songs' of-the-moment intensity. Ultimately, these new versions have less to do with Pearl Jam's music than with O'Brien's superfandom. Ten Redux closes with a paltry six bonus tracks. ""2,000 Mile Blues"" is atrocious Jimi worship, ""Evil Little Goat"" is Vedder's best Jim Morrison impersonation, and neither ""Breath"" (here retitled ""Breath and a Scream"") nor ""State of Love and Trust"" sound as vital here as they did on the Singles soundtrack. These tracks are obviously intended not to overlap with 2003's Lost Dogs: Rarities and B-Sides, but flipsides like ""Dirty Frank"" and ""Yellow Ledbetter"" were surprisingly popular satellites orbiting Ten, played often on radio stations that didn't typically delve that deep into any artist's catalog and shouted at concerts by fans who weren't that fanatic. Their absence limits the reissue, creating an incomplete portrait of the band in its earliest days. Ten deserved better than Ten Redux and the paltry bonus tracks. Fortunately, the reissue also includes a DVD of Pearl Jam's 1992 performance on ""MTV Unplugged"". The fashions are of course dated (nice fuzzy hat, Jeff Ament) and Vedder's stool-bound intensity can be fairly ridiculous, but the DVD is a useful and entertaining document of their intense live sets. Thanks to the tight rhythms of drummer Dave Abbruzzese and bass player Ament, the songs lose little of their momentum in this setting, which handily showcases the guitar interplay between Gossard and McCready. But this is Vedder's show-- a live, public debut for his idiosyncrasies. Taking the stage in a tight jacket and backwards baseball cap, he gradually unleashes himself during the show, first letting his hair down and then eventually losing the jacket. By show's end, he's balancing precariously on his stool and scrawling PRO CHOICE!!! on his arms with a Sharpie. Pearl Jam may have shunned the spotlight, but they were born showmen.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12873-ten-deluxe-edition/,"Epic,Legacy,Epic,Legacy",1991.0
304,Isaac Hayes,Black Moses,Pop/R&B,8.7,March 4 2009,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"During my first years out of college, I hung out every week at a friend's apartment in Midtown Memphis. Like most college grads' first apartments, the place was sparsely furnished and barely decorated-- an old couch, a few Salvation Army chairs, a desk lined with neurobiology textbooks. There was one effort at wall art, the LP cover of Isaac Hayes'  Black Moses  , which folded out into a cross with the singer-- clad in a Biblical caftan and sunglasses-- holding out his hands not in a crucifixion, but in blessing. The actual LPs stayed in their paper sleeves next to his TV, but from that place of honor on the wall, the apostle of funk-- one of Memphis' patron saints-- looked down upon us benevolently through many parties and late nights. It became so totemistic to this circle of friends that the music and the artwork are completely inseparable in my mind. I'm happy to report that Stax's new reissue of Black Moses , unlike the initial CD release in 1990, retains that original foldout packaging. It may be glossy instead of the matte finish I remember, and it may be CD-sized instead of the full LP measurements, but it still folds out into a cross, smaller but still somehow holy. In this case, the packaging for this album remains particularly important, not because of my personal attachment to it nor as a reminder that pop's material culture is slowly disintegrating in the digital age. Black Moses was at that point one of the most elaborate LP packages issued for a black artist and as such represented a show of faith that Hayes, fresh off the unprecedented success of the Shaft soundtrack in 1971, could command sales to rival those of his white contemporaries. And like that foldout cross, it was a massively ambitious statement album, a collection of covers and originals that documented the collapse of Hayes' marriage. It was an enormous success, lodging at #1 on the black charts for seven long weeks. The album title was not simply a glorifying nickname, but a sort of prophecy. Hayes led his people not to a promised land (racial relations in America during the 1970s were so complex and heated as to make any such place almost impossible to visualize) but to a freer musical sensibility that emphasized synthesis: rock, funk, disco, and new strains of soul music marked by elaborate arrangements and lengthy running times. Black Moses is brashly, lushly, and lovingly orchestrated, each track piled high with soundtrack strings, insistent horns, tender flutes, sultry back-up singers, and of course lots of wakka-chikka guitars, a Hayes signature. As far out as he got, Hayes always stayed rooted in pop music. Most of these songs are covers: Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"" a moody, pleading reminiscence; Bacharach-David's ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" a slow burn; the Jackson 5's ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" a dramatic testimony; Little Johnny Taylor's ""Part-Time Love"" a breathless groove; the Motown hit ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" a luscious jam. ""Good Love"", the lone Hayes original here, may be a minor horndog proposition, but in this context it sounds like a knowing smirk: ""We interrupt this broadcast for a special news bulletin,"" he intones in the intro. ""Let all the young women crowd around before the news begins."" Some of the joy of listening to Black Moses is hearing Hayes explode these songs from the inside, unpacking their groove potential yet leaving them recognizable. ""(They Long to Be) Close to You"" had already been a hit for the Carpenters and has since become a key exemplar of 70s pop cheese, but Hayes anchors it to a laidback drumbeat, adds the Hot Buttered & Soul singers in the background, and unfolds it into a nine-minute jam. It's startling to hear him sing the opening lines-- ""Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near?""-- in his supremely honeyed bass, but he gives the song a straight reading. At the time some critics derided these songs as aimless and self-glorifying, and Hayes' ornate orchestrations still carry a whiff of kitsch, but Black Moses remains unapologetic, often moving, and always entertaining. Stax is also reissuing Hayes' 1976 album, Disco Freak (Juicy Fruit) , accompanied by a similarly over-the-top packaging. The cover shows him shirtless in a pool blowing a kiss to the camera while surrounded by a bevy of fruit-draped beauties. Open the gatefold to see the women's feet with panties 'round their ankles. That packaging, likewise, is important: It may be the most interesting aspect of this album, which reveals Hayes' weaknesses just as surely as Black Moses reveals his considerable strengths. It begins with three full minutes of barely intelligible chatter, as Hayes and friends chat up a woman in the studio. By the time the clamor bleeds into the title track, you may have already tuned it out. Fortunately, ""Disco Freak"" saves it by immediately establishing an elastic groove complete with gasping guitar licks, throbbing basslines, and a bridge that goes ""Juicy Fruit sure is cute in her sexy jumpsuit."" This is Hayes in full disco mode, as the title makes clear, yet he never sounds quite as comfortable here as he does with the expansive hybrid soul covers of Black Moses . Hayes, who had written many of Stax's biggest hits, penned all of these songs himself, but here the Bacharach-David influence becomes clear-- and clearly curbs his audacity. The choruses of ""The Storm Is Over"" and ""Lady of the Night"" sound too smoothly polished to be very uplifting or seductive (the latter is particularly ridiculous), and upbeat numbers like ""Music to Make Love By"" and ""Thank You Love"" slip too easily from horny funk into a sort of lite jazz, without the urgency or drama of his best work. Hayes sounds comical, a humorless, one-dimensional ladies' man rather than the wounded romantic of Black Moses. This is not where he promised to lead us.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12760-black-moses-juicy-fruit-disco-freak/,"Stax,Stax,ABC,ABC",1971.0
305,Neko Case,Middle Cyclone,Folk/Country,7.9,March 3 2009,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Neko Case is a force of nature. Her voice can knock you over-- it's one of the strongest in any genre. She has immense control and surprising physical and stylistic range, able to jump from cowgirl honkytonk to pop muse to Americana banshee with ease and grace. However, on her fifth studio album, Middle Cyclone , she literally becomes a force of nature: Case sings opener ""This Tornado Loves You"" from the point of view of an actual tornado, tearing up trailer parks and cutting a 65-mile swath in search for its beloved: ""I carved your name across three counties,"" she sings defiantly as the guitars whip around her and the snare patters frantically, suggesting destruction can be a demonstration of love. Later she's a cyclone, an elephant, a killer whale, a dove, a magpie, and possibly a mollusk. ""I'm an animal,"" she sings on ""I'm an Animal"". ""You're an animal, too."" Middle Cyclone is another strong entry in her strange catalog, a culmination of some of the lyrical and musical concerns she's been exploring since Blacklisted , when she started receiving full songwriting credit. That 2002 album marked a turning point for Case as she abandoned the straightforward country-soul of 2000's Furnace Room Lullaby for a spookier sound that favors odd song structures and odder imagery about serial killers, downed planes, and automobile accidents. Fox Confessor Brings the Flood developed those ideas and Middle Cyclone further refines them. It plays almost like a culmination of her career this decade, the final installment of a trilogy about the weird American wilderness of her mind. Listeners more familiar with Case's previous work will appreciate the tendrils of mythology that reach from this album into her recent catalog. With its first-verse image of a man ""filleted on the stairs,"" ""Polar Nettles"" recalls the bloodspatter lyrics of ""Deep Red Bells"" on Blacklisted ; ""Red Tide"" and ""Magpie to the Morning"" play with critter imagery similar to ""Lion's Jaws"" and ""Maybe Sparrow"" on Fox Confessor . In fact, ""People Got a Lotta Nerve"" sounds like a sequel of sorts to ""The Tigers Have Spoken"", from her live album of the same name. Both concern zoo animals who rebel against their prisons, and both end, tragically and inevitably, in bullets. The album, however, doesn't demand any special context to be enjoyed: It sounds impressive and immersive on its own, so those who've only heard her name will find much to admire in her skewed songs. But because Case doesn't really write hooks and typically avoids the standard verse-chorus-verse song structure, Middle Cyclone may take even longer than previous albums to reveal their charms and mysteries. What ties everything together is her unmistakable voice. Pushing herself, she shows off a few new tricks in these songs. On ""People Got a Lot of Nerve"", she fashions one of the album's best hooks from the repeated syllables of ""man man man eater"", then ascends a vertiginous scale on the bridge, hitting that impossibly high note with no loss of tone. She layers her voice to create an airy chorus on ""Magpie to the Morning"" and a dramatic gospel on her cover of Sparks' ""Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth"". ""Prison Girls"" may be her best performance here, with an emphatic vocal that gives the chorus-- ""I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes""-- new meaning and greater menace with each repetition. Case remains her own best muse, a strong, feminine presence who demands you meet her songs halfway (she calls herself a control freak in every article I've read), but her band deserves credit for creating the ambient, dark-night setting in which her tales of murder and animals sound natural and compelling. Middle Cyclone features the same core group she's been playing with for years-- including guitarist Paul Rigby, bass player Tom V. Ray, multi-instrumentalist Jon Rauhouse, and back-up singer Kelly Hogan-- along with a supporting cast that includes regulars Garth Hudson of the Band, M. Ward, Sarah Harmer, and members of Calexico, the Sadies, and Giant Sand. With an increasing familiarity between them, this cast finds new ways to sell her songs and couch Case's vocals in unpredictable arrangements. ""People Got a Lotta Nerve"" kicks off with a chiming Byrds riff that makes it impossible not to perk up and listen to the song, and a strangled guitar line staggers through ""Fever"", implying an unnamed threat just off camera. Much of the album is acoustic and subdued, and a few of the slower songs start to sag a bit. The album picks up considerably towards the end, as ""Prison Girls"" lurches ominously like film noir and ""Red Tide"" generates a rumbling garage-rock stomp. Middle Cyclone ends with ""Marais la Nuit"", which translates to ""The Night Marsh"". True to its title, it is 30 minutes of frog noises that Case recorded at her farm in Vermont, just outside the barn where most of these sessions were held. It's not surprising that her animal lyrics would break down into real animal sounds, and as chill-out music for any domesticated wildlife in your home, it's not unpleasant. It is, however, nearly as long as the album proper. Its inclusion show just how thoroughly Case has imagined her own little world on these three albums and how thoroughly she rules that realm.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12729-middle-cyclone/,Anti-,2009.0
306,Peter Tosh,The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience,Global,4.0,February 23 2009,Mike Powell,Contributor,"""If I wasn't a singer,"" Peter Tosh once said, ""I'd be a bloodclaat revolutionary."" Funny he didn't think he could be both, because that's basically what he was: six-foot-three, stiff-lipped, carrying a guitar shaped like an M16 (a gift from a fan), cursing every 10 seconds, serially high, and considered such an effective agitator by cops that they beat him half to death in mid-1978. ""I survived them by intellect,"" he said later. Yuh. Tosh may have been a natural mystic, but I'm sure pot helped. His reggae career started alongside Bob Marley and Bunny Livingston in the Wailers, a group he left in the mid-70s after Island Records' Chris Blackwell refused to release his first solo album. No surprise, really-- compared to Marley, Tosh was nearly unmarketable. On love songs: ""You turn on the fuckin' radio, 24 bumboclaat hours a day you hear, 'Darlin I love you.' A man wouldn't sing to the almighty a rasclaat, him love a woman more than the creator who create the sun and the moon and the bumboclaat star."" On the enlightenment of the common man: ""I am going to kill the fuckery out there. People is going to be in demand for the truth."" If ""One Love"" was Bob Marley's song about paradise, ""Equal Rights"" was Tosh's: ""Everyone is crying out for peace, none is crying out for justice,"" a reminder that nobody argues against feelgood platitudes, but nobody works to make them come true, either. But one season's rebel is the next's vogue, and by 1978, Tosh was guesting on ""Saturday Night Live"" flanked by Mick Jagger dancing like an electrocuted game hen. In 1987, two years after the first digital dancehall single (King Jammy & Wayne Smith's ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"") radicalized Jamaican music, Tosh won a Grammy for No Nuclear War, a lukewarm hash of roots reggae-- the kind of muck longtime contributors to their fields finally win Grammys for regardless of quality. Months later, he was murdered in a botched robbery. For the volume and intensity of Tosh's anger, he had a poetic side, animated by magic and religion-- factors more obscure than politics, though equally as susceptible to bullshit. Stepping Razor: Red X-- a documentary packaged in The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience-- is based on a series of cassettes called the Red X Tapes, part biography, part philosophy, part folktale. Much of it is babble, but it's artful, seductive babble. This is the part of Tosh that sounds unreliable on record, but compelling in the form of a documentary, where anonymous commentators rally to elevate him to the level of myth. Even though the documentary isn't part of Tosh's output as a recording artist per se, it helps highlight what made him interesting: The conflict between art as a tool to disseminate truth to the masses, and as a way to mystify it as private ritual. Now to the product at hand. The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience is a $35 package containing one 14-track audio disc and two DVDs: Stepping Razor: Red X (which is already commercially available) and footage of several performances. It's not what it claims to be. His most famous songs-- ""Legalize It"", ""Equal Rights"", and ""Stepping Razor""-- are either absent or represented by alternate versions. There's nothing from his first album, Legalize It, and there are two versions of ""Wanted: Dread and Alive"". Why? I'm guessing it has to do with licensing. Shame on Shanachie Records, frankly. Tosh's biography was always more interesting to me than his music, but he certainly wrote some good songs, played with great sidemen, and released some brawny, tuff reggae-- all reasons he deserves a lovingly selected single-disc compilation behind his name. In fact, he has one already. Several. There's a part of the Red X Tapes where he talks about a time the devil wrapped him in barbed wire, which sliced peepholes in his eyelids that let him see the world's hypocrisy and corruption. I wonder what he'd see in this.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12695-the-ultimate-peter-tosh-experience/,Schanachie,2009.0
307,Dan Auerbach,Keep It Hid,Rock,6.2,February 12 2009,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Relative to the garage-rock outfits with whom they were compared to in the first part of this decade, the Black Keys have more or less stuck with their thing: austerely nostalgic, drums-and-guitar-in-a-dying-industrial-city blues-rock. Singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney have managed to forge a career and five albums out of variations-on-a-theme riffs and stripped-for-parts grooves, outliving almost all of those peers. They lack the audacity of Jack White (in fact, their blues-rock extends more from Midwestern modesty than from self-aware showboating), and the Reigning Sound's Greg Cartwright has a stronger melodic sensibility and more potent lyrical venom. Their limited range, however, stands in inverse proportion to their sturdy longevity, which always seemed built into their conceptual underpinning, as if the sheer quantity of songs legitimizes their Spartan approach. But last year's Attack & Release saw the Black Keys' resolve weakening: Auerbach and Carney collaborated with Danger Mouse and wrangled additional players-- including Jessica Lea Mayfield and Carney's uncle Ralph. That the additions of a high-profile producer and programmed beats only augmented rather than expanded their sound was both a bit comical and strangely commendable. You take the Keys out of their basement studio, but you can't take the basement studio out of the Keys. Now Auerbach has made a solo album, and in retrospect, this turn of events seems inevitable: Ostensibly he wanted to escape even momentarily his band's self-imposed restrictions and give vent to his wildest ideas, like having a bass player. Like Attack & Release, Keep It Hid takes only a few baby steps up the basement stairs. There are plenty of new song shapes and sound textures here, from the softly strummed opener ""Trouble Weighs a Ton"" to the brief din of ""Because I Should"" to the Smithsy guitar on ""Heartbroken, in Disrepair"". A sacred organ drenches ""Real Desire"" like profane sweat, and ""Whispered Words (Pretty Lies)"" struts on a Stax rhythm section and a nifty descending melody. ""When the Night Comes"" ends Side 1 on a quiet note, with soft keyboards and piano decorating some of Auerbach's most tender lyrics to date. Side 2 loses some of Side 1's urgency, as ""Mean Monsoon"" and especially ""When I Left the Room"" sound uncharacteristically unfocused. Nothing here, however, would sound at all out of place if ""Black Keys"" were written on the jewel case spine. Whether Auerbach should be criticized or credited for his consistency could be debated, but the approach, the mission, and the music here all sound pretty close to what we've heard before from his day-job band. As a Black Keys album, Keep It Hid sounds less detached and distracted than the Danger Mouse collaboration, but lacks the thickfreak sound of their earliest releases and the sharp songwriting of Rubber Factory. Auerbach has written horndog riffs like ""I Want Some More"" and ""Street Walkin'"" many times before, and neither is the best of his lot. And no offense to the dependable drumming of Bob Cesare, but these songs lack Carney's crafty, unhinged beats, which work overtime to fill in Keys' songs as much as possible. The biggest change here might be Auerbach himself, whose vocals have loosened up somewhat since The Big Come Up in 2002. On ""Whispered Words (Pretty Lies)"" and ""My Last Mistake"" he actually sounds indistinguishable from John Fogerty-- and the swampy drumbeat on the latter suggests he's aware of it. Rather than put him at the head of a small studio band like this, one wonders how he would sound either as a player in a more democratic unit (much like White in the Raconteurs) or backed by a pre-existing group like Drive-By Truckers, where he might have to work outside of himself to adapt to a communal sound. As it is, the more Auerbach changes things, the more they stay the same.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12669-keep-it-hid/,Nonesuch,2009.0
308,James Brown,"The Singles, Vol. 6: 1969-1970",Rock,8.4,February 3 2009,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"It was no surprise when James Brown's band collapsed in early 1970-- its members must have been incredibly frustrated. They were at the height of their powers, a devastating live act with a string of hits that showed no sign of abating. They also had a star who was barely recording with them while he chased a badly misunderstood crossover ideal in an attempt to reposition himself as a Frank Sinatra type, and whose vacillations about what to release made Hamlet look like John Wayne. The sixth volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only retrospective of Brown's singles and scheduled-but-unreleased singles opens with ""You Got to Have a Mother for Me"", a surefire hit with a chattering groove that broke new ground for him; it almost got pressed before he decided to scrap it, and it stayed in the can until the late 80s. In 1969, JB covered Chuck Jackson's ""Any Day Now"" with an arrangement by his new protégé Dave Matthews (not that one), scheduled it as an A-side, changed his mind about that version, re-recorded it, scrapped it in favor of an original called ""I'm Shook"", had 35,000 copies pressed, then decided he didn't want to release it after all. ""I'm Not Demanding"" was prepared as a single twice, then canceled. ""The Brother Got to Rap"" was another funk grenade cut with the touring band, prepared for rush release, then scratched before it could be pressed. (When the band fell apart a few weeks later, Brown remixed it, faded down its on-mic references to specific musicians, and released it as ""Brother Rapp"".) ""Talkin' Loud and Saying Nothin'"", a surprisingly awesome stab at acid-rock (recorded with Matthews and a Cincinnati band that also made a dubious psychedelic album under the name the Grodeck Whipperjenny), was pressed, then yanked before it could be distributed. Meanwhile, the stuff that actually did make it into circulation often seemed like bizarre choices. The instrumental hit ""The Popcorn"" was followed by a remake of ""You Got to Have a Mother for Me"" with ""Popcorn"" shoehorned into its title, then by the instrumentals ""Lowdown Popcorn"" and ""Popcorn with a Feeling"", as well as ""Let a Man Come In and Do the Popcorn"" and its follow-up-- the second half of the same take, ""Part Two (Let a Man Come In and Do the Popcorn)"". JB put a huge promotional push behind ""World"", an overwrought, funkless ""Let the Sunshine In"" ripoff (with strings), which he thought would be his big outreach to the hippies. (They preferred to dance to his good records.) The singles he actually did release with his touring band included a pair of improvised warmup jams. And damned if he didn't call it more often than not. ""Mother Popcorn"", the new version of ""You Got to Have a Mother"", was one of the hottest singles he ever made-- Clyde Stubblefield's cymbal smashes are as galvanizing as funk gets. Stubblefield's prestidigitative drum break at the end of ""Funky Drummer"", one of those wait-the-tape-was-rolling? jams, became the king of all samples. Both halves of ""Let a Man Come In"" hit the R&B Top 10. Even ""Talkin' Loud"" pales next to the hard funk version he released for real a few years later. Of all the volumes in this series so far, this one's actually got the fewest clinkers-- a Christmas single whose melody Soul Brother #1 evidently didn't learn before he walked into the booth, ""World"", another top-heavy ballad called ""A Man Has to Go Back to the Crossroads"". Even the throwaways (Matthews-arranged versions of ""Georgia On My Mind"" and JB's oldie ""Bewildered"", a duet with Vicki Anderson on ""Let It Be Me"", a six-minute call-and-response from an Apollo gig) are at least worthy of the man's sandpaper-and-lava voice. And the cuts with the touring band still glisten with power like sweat on a champion heavyweight: the jawdropping paean to male dominance ""It's a New Day"", the impossibly tense percolator ""Ain't It Funky Now"", and especially the two-part throwdown that replaced ""You Got to Have a Mother"" on the schedule, ""I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself)"". A victory strut with a three-against-four rhythmic switchup, it was one of Brown's most bluntly political statements, but it was also a personal manifesto, and a warning for anyone who tried to get too close to him. James Brown needed other people to realize his vision, but his erratic whims were just more proof that he was running the show.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12629-the-singles-vol-6-1969-1970/,Hip-O Select,2009.0
309,Bon Iver,Blood Bank EP,Rock,7.9,January 20 2009,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"For Emma, Forever Ago-- Bon Iver's 2007 debut LP-- was nearly eclipsed by its own (endlessly repeated) mythology. Famously: Singer and songwriter Justin Vernon curled up in a ""remote northern Wisconsin cabin"" for three epic, torturous months of post-heartbreak introspection/catharsis, writing the songs which would ultimately comprise his first solo album. For Emma was self-released by Vernon before being picked up by Jagjaguwar and afforded a proper launch; grateful listeners swooned and shivered, circling the record like kids around a bonfire. For Emma became synonymous with dark winter ennui: the musical translation of earth's cruelest season. By the end of 2008, Bon Iver-- along with similarly bearded, folk-minded acts like Fleet Foxes-- became emblematic of a new, woodsier trend in indie rock. Although it boasted its own brand of (presumably unintentional) theater, For Emma was frequently cited as an antidote of sorts to Auto-Tuned, vocoder-laden pop. It seems particularly skewering, then, that Bon Iver's four-song follow-up-- the Blood Bank EP-- closes with a long, a cappella folk song wherein Vernon's voice is so aggressively filtered through a vocoder that you're likely to back off the stereo and double-check the contents of your drink. Recorded in four different locations at varying times (from December 2006 through June 2008, in an assortment of apartments, roads, hunting lodges, and studios), Blood Bank's A-side (""Blood Bank"", ""Beach Baby"") is considerably less jarring than its second half, although neither feels unprecedented-- while Vernon wrote these songs to be played with a band (unlike on For Emma, Vernon's got two steady backers here), the EP is still imbued with all the intimacy and desperation that made For Emma so beloved. ""Blood Bank"" opens with prodding acoustic strums and a series of hushed ""oohs"" (unmistakably reminiscent of Iron and Wine's lo-fi debut, The Creek Drank the Cradle), before Vernon begins: ""I met you at the blood bank, we were looking at the bags,"" he explains, tossing off the kind of opening sentence most aspiring novelists spend their whole lives praying for. ""Beach Baby"", with its steel guitar and stomach-punching lyrics (""When you're out, tell your lucky one to know that you'll leave/ But don't you lock when you're fleeing, I'd like not to hear keys"") feels spare and fleeting, disappearing into the runout groove before you realize it's over. ""Babys"" features a prickly, unrelenting keyboard riff and a curiously zoological refrain (""Summer comes, to multiply!"") but ""Woods"" is the most intriguing cut here: For armchairists prone to detached psychoanalysis, For Emma's legend might suggest that Vernon has a penchant for escapism, and there's no easier way to eschew the crags of your own voice than by piling on studio effects. Vocoder isn't exactly a shack in the mountains, but, when employed to excess, it's about as close as a vocalist can get to going off-grid. Still, ""Woods"" feels like more of a formal experiment than an emotional one, and the results are oddly and unexpectedly stunning. Vernon's folksinger-in-a-cabin origins might not be exceptional, but ""Woods"" sort of is-- it's disorienting and delicate, a mix of Vernon's staunchly organic vocals and otherworldly effects, punctuated, on occasion, by sharp, falsetto howls. It's the kind of thing that sounds hideous on paper, but eventually coalesces in practice; ironically, the Auto-Tune serves as more of a muddler than a safety net, and without it, it's hard to know if ""Woods"" would feel so intoxicating. Blood Bank certainly dispels concerns that Vernon's accomplishment was somehow environmental-- that For Emma's poetic circumstances, and not its contents, were responsible for its success. Blood Bank is still a wintry record-- there's snow on the cover, and lyrics about snow, and, if you listen on vinyl, the metaphorical snow of hissing surface noise-- but Bon Iver is hardly a seasonal taste.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12581-blood-bank-ep/,Jagjaguwar,2009.0
310,My Morning Jacket,Live from Las Vegas at the Palms,Rock,7.0,January 16 2009,Joshua Klein,,"Just 10 years ago, My Morning Jacket were recording in abandoned grain silos, releasing albums on the tiny indie Darla, and otherwise living the life of any other unknown band. The difference was that My Morning Jacket were actually pretty great, and like the best-kept secrets it wasn't long before more people discovered the group. Fast forward a decade and My Morning Jacket draw spillover crowds at Bonnaroo, celebrate themselves with live albums and concert films, headline a New Year's Eve show at Madison Square Garden, and enjoy life at the top supported by one of rock's most dedicated fan bases. It's all left the group with little to prove beyond its own further longevity. Yet if their iffy 2008 album Evil Urges demonstrated anything, it's that, successful or not, Jim James and crew remain as restless as ever, and would rather do the wrong thing once in a while than do the right thing all the time-- especially if the right (read: predictable) thing threatens to turn to tedium. One result is that lame funk detours and other stylistic no-nos are now part of the band's permanent record, but hey, you win some and you lose some. Regardless, My Morning Jacket's live reputation remains undiminished. But Live From Las Vegas at the Palms isn't another stage-bound victory lap in the mold of the epic Okonokos. Instead, it's an iTunes-exclusive stopgap (or, more generously, a gift to fans) by way of the state of the art studio housed in the Palms casino in Vegas. That means there's a) No distracting crowd noise, and b) Pristine sound, two things one rarely (if ever) expects from a live release. Whether those niggling details nullify the EP's ""live"" status is another matter; it's also largely irrelevant since what is here is a pleasant if decidedly low-key and minor session of mostly old material capturing the quieter-- and quiet storm-- side of the band. The set leads with an infrequently performed early MMJ rarity, The Tennessee Fire-era ""Tonight I Want to Celebrate With You"", anchored by a reliably endearing Omnichord and a touch of spooky pedal steel before the rest of the band appears and (softly) fills in the empty spaces. The fine ""Dear Wife"", the only new song, would probably have fit comfortably on any of the band's last couple of records, but here it suits the almost cocktail lounge vibe of much of this EP. In this vein and in this context, ""Knot Comes Loose"", now replete with an instrumental outro, bests its not dissimilar counterpart on Z. It's looser and even lovelier. From there the EP goes further back once again, to two more Tennessee Fire gems, ""From Nashville to Kentucky"" and ""They Ran"", each given essentially fresh studio makeovers, a little polish to get the decade-old DIY rust off. The former gains drums and a sax solo (!); the latter 1950s-styled harmonies that recall what Big Star was up to circa its ethereal masterpiece Third/Sister Lovers. By the time ""Thank You Too"" fades, it's clear James has made good on his promise ""to provide the listener with a sensual and deeply personal method for relaxational listening...to be enjoyed on a candle-lit bench, a secluded nook, or a sensuous dinner party."" Well, partly. After the indulgences of Evil Urges, this is just the kind of palette cleanser both fans and fencesitters might appreciate. Yet each of these pretty trips down memory lane make you wish there were more where they came from. At a hair over 20 minutes, Las Vegas at the Palms fulfills the requirements of an EP-- it's short and sweet-- but it's also not entirely filling. If it was a sensuous dinner party James had in mind, then he must be a quick eater.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12601-live-from-las-vegas-at-the-palms/,iTunes,2009.0
311,The Killers,Day & Age,Rock,5.9,December 5 2008,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"""Are we human or are we dancer?"" That is the question. Well, that is a question. And Brandon Flowers' grammatically dubious query gets to the heart of the Killers Dilemma. Emotion or libido? Imperfect or impervious? Vegas losers or comped penthouse playboys? On ""Mr. Brightside"", they didn't have to worry about such binaries. Fresh, young and hammy, one of the strengths of the Killers' 2004 debut, Hot Fuss, was its unlearned pop bent. It was fizzy and silly, and there were no apologies. Then Sam's Town checked off almost every big time follow-up cliché there is: horn arrangements in place of songs, concept in place of lyrics, seriousness in place of nonchalance. If the makers of ""Gossip Girl"" created an HBO mini-series chronicling Dust Bowl despair, it would look like what Sam's Town sounds like. Album number three tries to split the difference. There are funk basslines that recall 1980s Bowie and producer Stuart Price (Jacques Lu Cont)-- who helmed Madonna's return-to-dance record Hung Up-- was brought in. But the songs still take on sweeping, Springsteen-ian stakes, and first single ""Human"", with its high-gloss finish, is one of only a few tracks any flesh and blood being would consider dancing to. Which brings us back to that initial question: human or dancer? According to Day & Age, the answer may be neither. Across the album, Flowers keeps himself above the fray, never wallowing too much in his own drama. There's the self-reflexive detachment of ""Human"", the holier-than-thou scoffing on opener ""Losing Touch"" (""I'm in no hurry, you go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch""), and, on ""Spaceman"", he actually leaves our planet for a spell with the help of an alien. The pose suggests a newfound sophistication-- no longer shall he be a slave to the petty desires of mere earthlings. Most traces of humanness on Day & Age come off oddly second-hand, as if Flowers uploaded Springsteen's or Bowie's catalogue to his internal memory and spat out a working simulacrum. This isn't all bad. On both ""Losing Touch"" and ""Spaceman"" Flowers pulls off fine recreations of Pompadour- and Ziggy-era Bowie, respectively. But something like ""A Dustland Fairytale"" is the nonsensical result of a Big Rock magnetic poetry kit. ""Out where the dreams are high, out where the wind don't blow/ Out here, the good girls die and the sky won't snow,"" sings Flowers, signifying everything but saying nothing. Similarly, ""This Is Your Life"" attempts to conflate stories from a couple Springsteen tunes-- take the title character of ""Candy's Room"" and put her out on the savage ""Jungleland"" streets-- and comes off like a half-hearted tribute. With his long distance relationship with down-to-earth emotions and his previous penchant for fake-looking facial hair, Flowers can be reminiscent of a latter-day Rivers Cuomo-- a weirdo trying to please himself and his audience at the same time but constantly coming up a little short on at least half of that equation. The other three guys in the Killers have taken all that Sam's Town criticism to heart more than their lead singer. On Day & Age, the experimentalism is more scattered and more rewarding. Instead of just pressing the ""huge and bombastic"" button ad nauseum, they diversify: so there's the comically Caribbean ""Joyride"" (with full-on touristy sax solo), the Strokes-gone-samba of ""I Can't Stay"" and the impressively brooding (and Björk-ish!) closer, ""Goodnight, Travel Well"". They're aiming to please some of the time, and they do. Less radical change-ups ""Losing Touch"" and ""Spaceman"" are the most obvious contenders for the inevitably incredible greatest hits compilation. ""Losing Touch"", in particular, is like a best of the Killers mashup: there's the crash cymbal chorus for fist-raising, the horn-strut verse for hip sliding, the ""Guitar Hero""-ready solo from underused ax man Dave Keuning. There's no central concept here-- even the album's title is as vaguely all-encompassing as possible. This is the Killers' spitball album, the one where they try everything and see what works while Flowers grasps for a relatable tone. ""When your chips are down, when your highs are low: joyride!"" he sings on the so-dizzy-it's-amazing ""Joyride"". It's the Killers at their most carefree-- the brooding behind them, they're ready to set out with the top down and the schmaltzy sax way, way up. Frivolity suits them, why shy away from it?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12505-day-age/,Island,2008.0
312,Guns N' Roses,Chinese Democracy,Rock,5.8,December 1 2008,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"To paraphrase another of rock's foremost procrastinators, Axl Rose just wasn't made for these times. Sure, armchair psychology and Axl Rose is a tired combination but it stands to reason that the only remaining original Guns N' Roses member expected Chinese Democracy to garner a 1990s-style brand-name reception: MTV would block off hours at a time to premiere its videos, fans desperate for real rock would line up at Sam Goodys nationwide for the midnight record release, and school would be forsaken to blast it on speakers the size of Greg Oden. Instead, ""Shackler's Revenge"" debuted on a video game, as if Gn'R were just some chump band on the come-up (or Aerosmith), and the album's world premiere found it meekly whispering through tinny computer speakers from a very un-rock MySpace page. Perhaps the most striking aspect of Chinese Democracy is that it's about the fifth-most shocking Guns N' Roses album. Sure, it's difficult to endure both Use Your Illusions in one sitting, but there's something fascinating about how the bombastically lonely ""Estranged"" could share disc space with the junior-high politicking of ""Civil War"", ""Yesterdays""' concise, sepia-toned pop, and the critic-baiting tantrum ""Get in the Ring"". Had that record been a career-ender, it would've been a fitting finale. Instead, Axl took 17 years to, we hoped, explore new textures, manipulate songwriting conventions, seek out challenging collaborators, or delve into unfamiliar genres for inspiration. Yet on the way to being this decade's Sgt. Peppers, Chinese Democracy became its Be Here Now-- a record of relatively simple, similar songs overdubbed into a false sense of complexity in a horrorshow of modern production values. Fans have long complained about Guns N' Roses still existing in the absence of Slash, Izzy, and even Duff, partially out of their talents, partially out of their iconography, and partially because there's no evidence Axl was an auteur figure who could work without his supporting cast. Judging from the personnel involved in the making of Chinese Democracy-- there were 18 musicians in all, not including orchestra players or the more than 30 who provided engineering and ProTools assistance-- it may be more appropriate now to think of Guns N' Roses as a free-floating creative project, even while the music itself suggests a more corporeal entity: The title track, after opening on a seemingly-interminable fade-in (it's been 17 years, another minute gonna kill ya?), pummels your ears with brickwalled, textureless power chords, the first of what seems like thousands of wah solos, and a xylophone. Initially, it's exciting to hear modern rock rendered in such operatic largesse, but the track ultimately proves insubstantial, a middle-aged symphony to nowhere. This is generally how the rockers go on Chinese Democracy, clocking in at anywhere from nearly five minutes to just over five minutes, using those minor-third/flatted-fifth riffs co-opted by far shittier bands in Gn'R's absence. You also get a couple of piano-led ballads aiming at radio stations that don't exist anymore, while songs like ""Catcher in the Rye"" and ""This I Love"" conjure Journey and REO Speedwagon, except you can't really sing along to them. There is, however, a level of craftsmanship that salvages Chinese Democracy as a listening experience-- Axl's voice sounds surprisingly great, and even ""Shackler's Revenge"" has an ultrasheen gloss that particularly benefits its chorus. The problem lies with Axlâ€™s creative direction: That same song is derailed by a grinding arrangement that suggests he's still looking to Korn records for inspiration. It's that flaw which ultimately delivers the fatal blow. Even if Chinese Democracy had dropped a decade previous, it would still sound dated. 1996 appears to be the cut-off point for sonic inspiration, a time when the height of electronic and rock synergy in pop music involved having an acoustic guitar and a drum machine on the same track. Fans deserve better than hearing Axl trying to fight with post-NIN nobodies like Stabbing Westward and Gravity Kills for ideas. ""Better"" and the closing ""Prostitute"" feature memorable, fluid melodies, but are tied to rudimentary Roland tracks that Steven Adler could've replicated in his sleep, and while ""I.R.S."" sports an Illusion-sized chorus, it's dampened by empty conspiracy theorizing. To that point, Chinese Democracy is inevitably and sadly limited in scope to the actual making of Chinese Democracy. Apart from a handful of appropriately vague love songs, Axl seems convinced that the only thing that's mattered to us over the past 17 years was anticipating whether ""Riad and the Bedouins"" might ever see its proper release. Anyone outside of Axl's inner circle appears lumped into some royal ""you"" and thrust into a meta exercise to be held up as evidence of a defiantly achieved victory: ""All things are possible/ I am unstoppable,"" ""No one ever told me when I was alone/ They just thought I'd know better,"" and most pointedly, ""It was a long time for you/ It was a long time for me/ It'd be a long time for anyone/ But looks like it was meant to be."" Strangely, Chinese Democracy comes off like the inverse of the record it will likely finish behind on the week's Billboard chart, Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak-- one terribly protracted and isolated, the other dashed off and intensely personal. And yet, both feel humanizing in proving that even megacelebrities can deal with life-altering pain and expectations and still have little to say about it. In an April Fools' review of Chinese Democracy written two years ago, Chuck Klosterman suggested that if it wasn't the greatest album ever released, it would be seen as a complete failure. Chinese Democracy needed to be a spectacle-- something that either validated its tortuous birthing process or a Hindenberg so horribly panned it would somehow validate Rose as a misunderstood genius. Instead, it's simply a prosaic letdown, constructed by a revolving cast of misfits ultimately led astray by a control freak with unlimited funding and no clear purpose, who even now remains more myth than artist.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12469-chinese-democracy/,Black Frog,2008.0
313,Wu-Tang Clan,Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan,Rap,7.5,November 25 2008,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"A few weeks ago, BET aired Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan, a documentary which promised never-before-seen footage of the Staten Island group's rise to fame. The accompanying soundtrack does absolutely nothing of the sort-- but really, that's sort of the point. Regardless of how many of us dutifully buck up every summer for Rock the Bells, there's still classic rock-style money to be made off the Wu-Tang legend. And invested parties can't always rely on merely pleasing those old enough to have skipped AP Calc so they could cop the enhanced-CD version of Wu-Tang Forever at the local Coconuts. After all, RZA told us we didn't even need to go to summer school as long as we had ""Black Shampoo"" and ""Dog Shit"" as educational guidance. Best-case scenario is that Wu reach the rarified territory of freshman dorm rack-fillers like Eagles Greatest Hits Vol. 1, Led Zeppelin IV, or that Doors double-LP with a shirtless Jim Morrison doing the Jesus Christ pose. Not in terms of sales, but in the manner in which it inspires you to purchase every single LP from the group within the span of a week, even to the point where you find yourself paying legal tender for motherfucking Coda (translates to ""Iron Flag"" in Wu-speak). It's hard not to see that being the case, because for a group not known as a singles act-- and whose studio records are considered sacrosanct-- the singles are more than adequate preparation for the deeper cuts. Judged by the music itself, Wu deserves some gaudy grade-- unsurprising, considering it contains half of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and neglects anything that came out after the year 2000. Time has done nothing to lessen the impact of these tracks, and though the group has viciously asserted itself as purveyors of true hip-hop, the sheer physical violence of 36 Chambers (as many people quote the intro to ""Method Man"" as the song itself) made it crucially appeal to people who had no prior investment in the genre. Regardless of the punk approach to communitas on the mic (outside of starmaking single ""Method Man"") and production (the record is rumored to have been released unmastered by Loud), ""Bring Da Ruckus"" and ""Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing To F' Wit"" are themselves broadsides against whatever complacencies are pissing you off that day. There's little left to be said about these inclusions, though leaving off the more ""message"" selections (""Tearz"", ""Can It Be All So Simple"") indicates that Wu is first and foremost seeking to prove that the Clan was hook-filled if not necessarily pop in the traditional sense. Choices from the first round of solo releases are solid as well, drawing from the most sonically compatible records-- Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"" and Raekwon's ""Incarcerated Scarfaces"" remain admirable in their ability to condense two very different and very dense albums into concise single servings. Ghostface Killah's Ironman (bizarrely castigated at the time as a weak link) is repped twice-- ""Daytona 500"" will likely always remain the definitive interpolation of ""Nautilus"", while 100 bars and runnin' mixtape rambles will likely always have to answer to Cappadonna's stunning turn in ""Winter Warz"". Due to its chronology, Wu likely couldn't help but feel either unbalanced or oddly sequenced, but that's curiously not the case. Once Wu-Tang Forever is introduced, it feels like a completely clean break from anything before it. Deeper cuts hint at the sort of issues that would metastasize during the later part of the decade-- clashing agendas, general bloat, and RZA outsourcing beats to talented but less interesting disciples while fancying himself as more of a traditional ""musician."" Despite how it was held as a beacon of old-school craftsmanship in light of Bad Boy and No Limit, the strange thing about the Forever songs is how functional some of the beats sound. Can you even remember how the actual music to ""Triumph"" goes? It may have been out of necessity-- as dense and visceral as the Clan was on 36 Chambers, nearly every member had simply grown too metaphysically big for another 50-minute format. Even the singles from Forever feature writing of astonishing compositional complexity-- particularly for an album that sold several million copies during one of hip-hop's more vapid stretches. Rhymes in the past weren't difficult to parse, more likely relying on blunt simile and battering ram brute force-- ""I'll scream on your ass like your dad,"" ""I make more noise than heavy metal."" Meanwhile, ""Reunited"" and ""Triumph"" boast some of the most iconic introductory verses in hip-hop, the latter so intimidating in its perfection that GZA made the legendary claim that no one was initially willng to follow Inspectah Deck on the track. After that, Wu just sort of stops altogether, ignoring the second-gen solo drops with the exception of Cappadonna's spittle-flecked ""Run"", a track whose thunder has been co-opted by Ghostface's song of the same name and subject matter (you can't fuck with that orange furry hat). The W piggybacked off the goodwill earned by Supreme Clientele, returning to a grimier, subterranean production aesthetic and featuring some of Ghost's most off-the-chain ramblings. Yet, its sole contribution to this disc is the embarrassingly gimmick ""Gravel Pit"", descirbed by RZA in The Wu-Tang Manual as ""sober,"" a claim that its attendant video goes to great lengths to refute. So yeah, it's easy to criticize how Wu leaves out a lot of the fun extraneous bullshit that's as noteworthy as the songs themselves-- ""Wu Wear (The Garment Renaissance)"", 1-900-RAEKWON, Killah Priest somehow going gold, a video game of unfathomable shittiness. Wu never had much chance of fulfilling the promise of its title within the span of a single hour (in fact, it merely steals its name from the documentary), still, as far as stocking-stuffers go, it's hard to advise against it as a smart expenditure or guidelines for a great mixtape-- just make sure you have Liquid Swords readily available when whoever you give this to inevitably asks for it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12468-wu-the-story-of-the-wu-tang-clan/,Legacy,2008.0
314,Grace Jones,Hurricane,"Electronic,Rock",7.5,November 21 2008,Joshua Klein,,"When Grace Jones emerged after a prolonged self-imposed exile as part of last summer's Massive Attack-curated Meltdown festival-- at 60, fearlessly clad in a corset and thong-- she was met with the predictable cries of comeback. But Jones' performance felt less like a resurrection and more like a return, comet-like. After all, how can a personality as huge as Jones' ever really vanish? She might slip off to the side, but she's never really gone. All the same, Hurricane is Jones' first new album in nearly 20 years. And unlike her revered early material from the 1980s, which found her reinventing and often outright owning songs by the Normal, Pretenders, Iggy Pop, the Police, Tom Petty, and Roxy Music, Hurricane features all originals, each a Jones co-write at that. Yet Jones' collaborators clearly had a notion of what songs-- and what sounds-- would be a good fit for her, and space-age riddims seem to be it this time around. In fact, at first the disc almost seems to be returning the favor to Bristol's best, sometimes sounding like a tribute or lost sequel to Massive Attack's Mezzanine, recreating that oddly timeless album's dubby menace. But the resemblance may be mostly coincidence, a product of circumstance. At least some of Hurricane was reportedly recycled from several sessions stretching back as far as a decade, including the titular first single, a Tricky collaboration. He's not alone among the disc's many guests, either, which include Brian Eno, Tony Allen, and the indomitable Sly & Robbie, always Jones' greatest ally, foil, and support team. But this being Grace Jones, she easily upstages her contingent of helpers. Indeed, Jones isn't so much a singer as a force of nature, a black hole that pulls all attention right to its center. Or, to invoke the more terrestrial metaphor of the album's title track: ""I can be cool, soft like the breeze/ I'll be a hurricane, ripping up trees!"" That nicely sums up the album's dual strengths, with Jones taking charge as one-woman wrecking crew but, more surprisingly, occasionally ratcheting things down to an introspective and intimate level as well. Jones also proclaims that she can give birth to sheep, so her particular brand of crazy is never far behind. But if it's Jones' kookiness that keeps her so interesting, it's her instinct for strong material that makes her so compelling. Surely, as far as reintroductions go, the opening ""This Is"" is killer, its relentless dancehall pulse as ear-catching as Jones' angular form is ever eye-catching. Immediately, however, the Wendy and Lisa co-write ""Williams' Blood"" reveals a new, explicitly autobiographical side to Jones, as she pays tribute to her mother Marjorie and the gift of music she passed down to her daughter. The track is a tour de force, from its turn to the dark and electric to its passing quote of ""Amazing Grace"". ""Corporate Cannibal"", at one point the title of the album, is stranger but also slightly aware of its own ridiculousness. ''I'll consume my consumers, with no sense of humor,"" Jones growls, before kicking into throbbing low-end gear. ""I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)"" is slower and suppler, giving Jones a chance to hit a few notes as she once again honors her mother. From here on out, Hurricane is classic Jones. ""Well Well Well"", ""Sunset Sunrise"", and the creeping ""Love You to Life"" are all reggae-rock hybrids that would fit any year in the past 30, and the pummeling slo-mo electro-dub of title track a statement of purpose if ever there was one. ""Devil in My Life"" ends the disc on a restrained industrial note, its lyrics apparently drawn from an evening spent people watching at a party. Grace Jones, people watching, ceding the spotlight and staring from the sidelines? Now that's a shock. That Grace Jones would finally break radio silence with a disc this exciting is somewhat less so.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12453-hurricane/,Wall of Sound,2008.0
315,Beyoncé,I Am... Sasha Fierce,Pop/R&B,5.7,November 21 2008,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"Though she's only 27, Beyoncé goes out of her way to be an old-fashioned celebrity, the type offended by Pete Wentz blogging about Oscar the Grouch or Britney Spears Twittering her life away. ""I feel that, especially now with the Internet and paparazzi and camera phones, it's so difficult to maintain mystery,"" she said earlier this year. ""It's almost impossible to have superstars now, because people will never get enough."" And, in our TMZ-addled world, her reluctance to entertain most questions about her personal life is both refreshing and a bit stubborn. She's a megawatt anachronism in sky-high heels and a frozen smile. So, without much outside interference, Beyoncé's fan-artist connection relies almost wholly on her music-- the only place to find the ""real"" Beyoncé is on her albums. With that direct relationship in mind comes I Am... Sasha Fierce, a supposed window into the soul of Beyoncé as well as her hair-flipping sexpot alter ego who happens to be blessed with the ultimate ""Project Runway"" moniker. The ""split-personality"" gimmick is now a tired and, more often than not, hapless pop theme (see: Garth Brooks's proto-emo character Chris Gaines, T.I. vs. T.I.P, the street vs. boardroom dynamic of hubby Jay-Z's Kingdom Come). Sasha Fierce will not disturb that unfortunate trend. Unlike 2006's underrated funk-fest B'Day, which held together remarkably well as an LP and saw Beyoncé ditching sap for sass, this record isn't supposed to coalesce. Speaking once again to her penchant for the outdated and obsolete, it's a 2xCD affair also available in a deluxe edition with five additional tracks. (Didn't anyone tell her about Christina Aguilera's recent diva-fied double disc disappointment Back to Basics ... and that you're supposed to put the deluxe edition out six to eight months after the regular edition?) Sasha Fierce puts Beyoncé back into the ""singles artist"" column-- only the blindly devout would consider slogging through the deluxe edition multiple times; only the foolishly puritanical would deny the occasional high-gloss super hits. Nobody wins the Beyoncé vs. Sasha battle-- often, the listener loses. On the Beyoncé side, while tracks like the effective (and affecting) gender-bender ""If I Were a Boy"" and the stunning love-as-god power ballad ""Halo"" (courtesy of ""Bleeding Love"" scribe Ryan Tedder) find the singer both strident and exposed, there's lots of wispy nonsense seemingly dug out of Celine Dion's scrap pile. Her twist on ""Ave Maria"" is vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional. Flip to Sasha, which is more listenable overall, but also more pandering. There's the one that sounds like past Beyoncé hits (""Single Ladies [Put a Ring on It]""), the one that sounds like ""A Milli"" (""Diva""), and the one that sounds like Rihanna (""Sweet Dreams""). For someone famous for effortlessly sparking trends, there are a surprising amount of opportunistic retreads here. Beyoncé is a capital-S Star, and one glimpse of her onstage makes it clear why she's earned her right to operate above the fray. But an album isn't a concert, and there are simply not enough Sasha Fierce songs worthy of her or our time. (The hopelessly benign ""Smash Into You"" will provide a prime bathroom break moment on her next world tour, though.) While this LP is more painstaking than B'Day, the extra effort dulls any emotional wallop; B'Day, in all its hectic glory, offered a much more vivid peek into the elusive mind of Beyoncé than Sasha Fierce, which often reads more like projection than reality. Considering the wealth of characters this multi-talent is currently amassing between movies and alter egos, the notion of Beyoncé is more splintered now than ever. Sasha Fierce doesn't help her put the pieces back together.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12462-i-am-sasha-fierce/,Columbia,2008.0
316,Lil Wayne,Dedication 3,Rap,3.7,November 20 2008,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Lil Wayne's been calling himself the best rapper alive since way before anyone took the claim seriously. On Dedication 2, the second in the series of reputation-cementing mixtapes Wayne made with DJ Drama, he explained: ""I am better than everybody. I'm a competitor. I hope everybody else feel the same way about their craft. If you do, it makes it better for the people."" So that was it: In an era of hustlers-not-rappers, Wayne was one of the few who took his occupation seriously, who put in 16-hour days coming up with the sort of word-drunk, out-there punchlines that made the world take him seriously. In a few years' time, Wayne went from a goofy Southern kiddie-rapper to a force of nature. Fast forward to this year: Tha Carter III is the biggest-selling album of 2008 and also one of the most acclaimed-- in part because Wayne put so much work in. Note the past tense: Wayne no longer has anything to prove, and Dedication 3, his new Drama mixtape, sounds like it. Wayne is very good at a few things: rapping, picking beats, making goofy facial expressions in videos. He's not especially good at playing guitar or singing or selecting rappers for his record label. But those other things seem to be monopolizing his attention these days. There's no guitar on Dedication 3, thank God, but we get a whole lot more of Wayne's off-key Auto-Tuned warbling than we get of his actual rapping, and he mostly leaves the rhyming to his Young Money Entertainment signees, which anyone who's heard Mack Maine's shockingly clumsy guest-verse on the ""Got Money"" video knows is a bad thing. When Wayne does get around to rapping, he usually sounds like he's fried his brain on so much cough syrup that he can barely bring himself to stick to the beat or come up with more than one good line. This is a circa-2008 DJ Drama mixtape, which means the beats, both new and vintage, will be top-notch and well-sequenced, but it also means Drama's own weed-carriers Willie the Kid and L.A. the Darkman will be along for the ride. The title track sets the tone: Over Drama associate Don Cannon's pretty-great beat for Outkast's ""Da Art of Storytelling, Part 4"", Wayne gargles out an unmemorable chorus while Willie, Mack Maine, and Gudda Gudda spit boringness; Wayne jumps on at the end for a quick afterthought of a verse. This is the first track, and it goes on for nearly seven minutes. Things don't get a lot better from there. Every big-name rapper these days has a crew of associates, but only a few-- T.I. and Kanye-- have ones worth hearing. But, hey, these guys need to rap somewhere, so it might as well be on a free online mixtape. Still this is a Dedication mixtape, and listening to all three of them in order tells a sad story. The last two featured Wayne, hungry and fearsome, ready to take over the world through whacked-out genius and force of will. This time, he's barely paying attention. Example: ""Get Bizzy"". The track snatches the simple, spacey, orchestra-hit-heavy beat to V.I.C.'s ""Get Silly"", exactly the sort of low-budget novelty-hit that the Wayne of two years ago would've just annihilated, the way he did to Dem Franchize Boyz' ""I Think They Like Me"" on Dedication 2 or DJ Unk's ""Walk It Out"" on Da Drought 3. This time he drools all over the track in a half-conscious Auto-Tuned slur, loses the beat a couple of times, comes up with exactly one slick line (""Red scarf on my neck/ Red diamonds looking like red barf on my neck, uhh""), then turns the whole thing over to the unbelievably shitty Plies sound-alike Gudda Gudda. Epic fail. More bad decisions: Tyga, the squeaky-voiced younger cousin of Gym Class Hero Travis McCoy, gets pole position on Drumma Boy's gothically churning beat for Young Jeezy's ""Put On"" and he absolutely sucks. Nondescript protégé Nikki Minaj, meanwhile, gets to defile the beat to T.I.'s ""No Matter What"" so she can complain (in Auto-Tune, guh) about the haters she's not famous enough to have. And for the first time, a Wayne signee-- Jae Millz, journeyman veteran of the New York mixtape and battle circuits-- upstages his boss. Millz isn't a great rapper, but he's got a no-bullshit monotone flow and a way with punchlines: ""Y'all nothing like me, fuck boy, don't be outlandish/ We gorillas in the mist, y'all just some kung fu pandas."" Here and there, we get brief flashes of the truly nasty Wayne, but we have to wade through so much bullshit to find these gems that it's barely worth the effort. One of Wayne's most entertaining moments comes on a non-rapping skit where he's just talking about Sarah Palin-- and he even loses focus near the end of that. We've been here before. The first time Wayne started fucking around with Auto-Tune was on another near-unlistenable mixtape released near the end of last year, Empire's unlicensed Da Drought Is Over, Part 4. When I heard that, I wrote that Wayne might need to slow down, that his appetites and his volume of output were finally starting to bring down the quality of his work. Wayne pulled it together for Tha Carter III, and a handful of post-album guest-appearances (Drake's ""Ransom"", Keri Hilson's ""Turnin' Me On"") show that he's still a monster when he wants to be. But when he stops wanting it, we get bullshit like Dedication 3.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12444-dedication-3/,Self-released,2008.0
317,Johnny Cash,Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison: Legacy Edition,Folk/Country,9.7,October 23 2008,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"It's odd not hearing ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" at the very beginning of this 2xCD/1xDVD set of the Man in Black's infamous show at Folsom Prison. His signature introduction-- as if he actually needed to tell an audience who he was-- is one of the best moments in recorded rock history, rendered in his immediately recognizable robust baritone and prompting unabashed applause. On all previous editions of this concert, whether vinyl, cassette, eight-track, or CD, have begun with that four-word intro, but Columbia/Legacy's new set relegates it to the actual moment in the show, well after Carl Perkins and the Statler Brothers have warmed up the crowd. Here it's revealed to be a rehearsed moment: Hugh Cherry: I need your help. When John comes out here, he will say-- and which will be recorded-- ""Hi there. I'm Johnny Cash."" When he says that, then you respond. Don't respond to him walking out. Welcome him after he says, ""Johnny Cash."" I'll have my hands up, and you just follow me. Johnny Cash: Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. Crowd: Goes nuts. Call it staged if you want, but the moment comes across as genuine, as if the emcee had told the prisoners what they had planned to do anyway. And it's justified by Cash's notoriously volatile performance, which made this concert the foundation of his mid-career resurgence and the framing device for the 2005 biopic Walk the Line. His countercultural appeal during the late 1960s and his abiding popularity throughout the 1970s are grounded in the rough-and-tumble energy he exudes on stage. This edition of At Folsom Prison is a companion piece of sorts to Columbia/Legacy's 2006 reissue of At San Quentin, but it's easily the greater of the two, if only because it was both such a risky endeavor and such a rewarding payoff. When Cash and his crew arrived to play this show, he had been playing prisons routinely and had even serenaded the rowdy crowds at Folsom before, but this was the first time anyone had seen any commercial benefit in recording a show. Described as worried but determined before the show, Cash gives a superlative performance, feisty and playful and a bit maudlin. It's an ideal setlist, with every song playing to the prisoners: ""25 Minutes to Go"" and ""Dark As a Dungeon"" of course, but also ""Green, Green Grass of Home"" and ""I Still Miss Someone"", which evoke a more general sense of yearning. Furthermore, the definitive versions of several of his hits are here, including the raucous ""Cocaine Blues"" and ""Folsom Prison Blues"", but the show is equally remarkable for the banter he maintains with the prisoners. Playing off their excitement, he slyly portrays himself as a rebel: Before ""I Still Miss Someone"", Cash explains, ""This show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records, and you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that."" Previously the latter has been bleeped out, but this reissue reinstates the expletive. ""How does that grab you, Bob?"" he asks, referring to producer Bob Johnston. Cash played two shows that day, one at 9:40 in the morning and another at 12:40 in the afternoon. While previous editions of At Folsom Prison have reproduced the bulk of the first show while drawing one or two tracks from the second, the Columbia/Legacy edition presents both performances uncut and remastered, which gives the set a documentary feel as well as some historical weight. The first performance sounds tense and immediate, the second somewhat relieved, less energetic and therefore less urgent. The liners suggest that Cash was simply tired, but it seems more likely that the worst of it was over and he knew he had nothing left to prove at that point. Even so, the rough second-show performances of ""Greystone Chapel"" might just surpass Cash's first-show take. With June Carter and the Statlers, he runs through the song twice, channeling all his woe and weariness as he tries to get a good take. That the song's composer, Glen Sherley, was then a Folsom inmate not only lends it gravity, but also bolsters the suspicions Amanda Petrusich addresses in her Pitchfork review of At San Quentin-- namely, that Cash's prison shows ""exploited the convicts' plight to buoy his own rep."" And of course, Cash never really did all the hard time he sang about in ""Folsom Prison Blues""; his violations were largely misdemeanors (picking flowers in Starkville, Mississippi) rather than outright felonies (shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die). But his lackluster rap sheet doesn't make these two shows any less rewarding or meaningful. Rather, they have the force of empathic endeavors, as if he were doing penance for his notorious bad habits. Having courted his own prison sentences-- both literally and metaphorically-- Cash knew how little separated the free and the condemned, so he turned his angst into raucous country music during his first performance and breathed a deep sigh of relief during his second.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12331-johnny-cash-at-folsom-prison-legacy-edition/,Columbia,2008.0
318,The Clash,Live at Shea Stadium,Rock,7.7,October 17 2008,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"While the Sex Pistols' ""no future"" became the bumper-sticker slogan of choice for first-wave UK punk rock, their London rivals the Clash built their program on an edict of ""no past."" As Julien Temple's recent documentary, Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten, illustrated, the titular Clash frontman went to great lengths to distance himself from his well-established pre-punk/pub-band roots, and perhaps as a result, the Clash railed against classic-rock hero worship harder than most, by taking names (""no Elvis, Beatles, or the Rolling Stones in 1977!""), stealing sacred riffs (the Who's ""I Can't Explain"" bastardized into ""Clash City Rockers"") and redesigning pop history in their own image (the Elvis-swiped cover art of London Calling). So surely these detractors of ""phony Beatlemania"" must've had a good ol' laugh at the prospect of conquering one of the key sites of the real Beatlemania. Of course, it would take a tour invite from the Who to get the Clash into Shea Stadium on Oct. 13, 1982, but in a way that just makes the story all the more rich: the punks meet the godfathers-- the former at the peak of their commercial ascendancy, the latter on the way to the first of many retirements. But while the two bands were born of different eras, both had followed similar trajectories, having each made their own escapes out of garageland to pursue more ambitious musical plans. And yet Live at Shea Stadium (a popular bootleg now receiving official release on its 26th anniversary) marks something more than just the passing of the torch between two generations of kindred spirits; it also documents the first time class-of-'77 punk-rockers graduated to the American stadium circuit, and the pyrrhic victory contained within. The Shea show was not the biggest the Clash ever played in America (that would be the US Festival in 1983), nor the most incendiary (see: the legendary 17-show string at New York's Bond Casino in 1981), but the set most vividly captures the Clash's most enduring qualities: the triumphs and tribulations of being populist punks.
 
Fittingly, the Clash's Shea Stadium coronation would come in a downpour of very English rain. But where the Who might use such a backdrop to dramatize a typically blustery version of ""Love, Reign O'er Me"", for the Clash, the soggy weather was an ideal way to make a ballpark feel more like a sweaty dive. Following a humorously crowd-baiting opening spiel from Clash cohort Kosmo Vinyl, Joe Strummer introduces ""London Calling"" by declaring ""welcome to the Casbah Club!"" It's the first of many quips that Strummer uses to downsize the stadium spectacle into more club-like dimensions (""shhh… would you please stop talking at the back, it's too loud!""), and he's also careful not to turn his elevated podium into a pulpit; rather than use the spotlight to educate the American masses on the urban unrest that inspired ""Guns of Brixton"", Strummer simply offers, ""If you don't know what's goin' on, just ask the person standing next to you."" Foreshadowing the BBC Radio Global a Go-Go broadcasts that would define his later career, Strummer sounds happiest playing cruise-leader to his band's genre tourism, talking the audience through a live mash-up of Sandinista's rap-rock prototype ""The Magnificent Seven"" and Willie Williams' reggae standard ""Armagideon Time"" like he was holding a bus megaphone: ""This is a black New York rhythm we stole one night...so while we're here doing our little thing, I'm gonna take you to Jamaica...so hold on, fasten your seatbelts, extinguish all reefers!"" But while Strummer's stage banter frequently highlights the seeming absurdity of the Clash playing a venue the size of Shea, the set list more than justifies their promotion to it, adhering as it does to the time-honoured stadium-rock tradition of playing the hits and playing them often; even the band's current release at the time, Combat Rock, is represented only by its two popular singles (which means there's no ""Straight to Hell"" to lure in newly arrived ""Paper Planes"" chasers). Highlighting the staggering procession of classic singles the band had amassed in just five short years, the incredibly well-preserved (or greatly refurbished) Live at Shea Stadium recordings make the contradictory concept of stadium-punk seem like a natural state: if anything, the lock-and-load riffs of ""Tommy Gun"" and the shout-and-response reworking of Eddy Grant's ""Police on My Back"" sound like they were originally designed with the bleachers in mind. Live at Shea Stadium, however, also provides a glimpse into the existential quandaries that would afflict agit-punk progeny from Rage Against the Machine to Against Me! onward: that is, the inherent difficulty of reconciling your activist politics with your growing bank balance. As the lone Clash original featured from their 1977 debut, ""Career Opportunities"" seems like a particularly odd choice to play at Shea, if only because these sorts of gigs forever distanced the Clash from the dole-line doldrums detailed within (a notion the Clash themselves seemed to have already addressed with Sandinista!'s cheeky kiddie-choir cover version). You can also hear the band's simmering tensions play out in the rather hollow version of ""Rock the Casbah"", which suffers from both the physical and spiritual absence of Topper Headon, the drummer who came up with the song's rhythm and its indelible piano-rolled hook, but whose chronic drug problems got him ousted from the band on the eve of the Combat Rock tour (to be replaced by original Clash drummer Terry Chimes). As a result, the Clash's most effortlessly funky tune is rendered as a rather joyless, standardized guitar rocker-- one that betrays the flagging enthusiasm that would eventually send Mick Jones packing less than a year later, and force Strummer to deep-six the band for good following 1985's roundly derided Cut the Crap, the only band that matters silenced with barely a mutter. In a cunning premonition of their own impending collapse, the Clash bid Shea Stadium adieu with their signature cover of the Bobby Fuller Four's ""I Fought the Law"", the ultimate fight song for those who got no more left in them. The Clash may have showed up at Shea to inherit the Who's torch and create a new model of the thinking person's rock star for the 1980s, but they ultimately flubbed the hand-off-- and a group of Irishmen were more than happy to swoop in from the sidelines and run away with it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12322-live-at-shea-stadium/,Sony,2008.0
319,The Pretenders,Break Up the Concrete,Rock,6.4,October 7 2008,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"As an American ex-pat living among London punks in the late 1970s, Akron native Chrissie Hynde wanted desperately to start her own band and be part of the scene, even if the scene was changing rapidly. She and three guys formed the Pretenders and released their first album in 1980. Three decades later, The Pretenders stands as one of the best rock debuts ever, and a wellspring of durable songs like ""Brass in Pocket"" and ""Mystery Achievement"". That origin story may explain why Hynde continues to record under the Pretenders shingle instead of under her own name. Most of the band's albums have been glorified solo efforts, with Hynde's grace-and-gravel voice the only constant in a lineup that changes with every release. Each new iteration of the Pretenders allows Hynde to tweak her rock sound however slightly, to move in different directions. Break Up the Concrete-- the ninth Pretenders album and the first for Steve Bing's Santa Monica-based indie Shangri-La Music (not to be confused with venerable Memphis indie Shangri-La Records)-- features a new lineup that includes Pernice Brother James Walbourne on guitar, former Son Volt'er Eric Heywood on pedal steel, Pretenders touring bassist Nick Wilkinson on bass, and veteran session musician Jim Keltner on drums (who will be replaced by original drummer Martin Chambers on tour). Resituating the Pretenders sound in a roadhouse, the new band infuses Hynde's lefty-righteous rockers with bar-band bravado, adding a rumbling Bo Diddley beat to the title track and a stomping rockabilly recklessness to opener ""Boots of Chinese Plastic"". But they're an agile and restrained crew, adding raw gravitas to barely-hanging-on ballads like ""You Didn't Have To"" and ""The Last Ride"". Aside from some nice country flourishes, it's really the same as it ever was: The tumbling, tight-jointed riffs of ""Rosalee"" recall the punchy rhythms of early hits like ""Tattooed Love Boys"" and ""Cuban Slide"", while ""Don't Lose Faith in Me"" and ""One Thing Never Changed"" possess similarly graceful melodies and tough-minded lyrics as ""Kid"" and ""I'll Stand By You"". Even so, Break Up the Concrete seems a bit uneven: The faster numbers begin to sound the same after a while, and the album hits a slight lull halfway through. It may be the best Pretenders album since the 1980s, but that isn't really saying much. For all her rock gusto, Hynde isn't prolific. This is only her fifth album since the Pretenders' career-defining comp The Singles in 1987, and Break Up the Concrete handily skirts the studio sheen and reaching-more-than-grasping quality that defines 1994's Last of the Independents and 2002's Loose Screw. The new lineup's roughed-up sound proves a natural setting for Hynde's signature vocals perfectly and enlivens her performances. At 57, she still sounds as strong as she did 30 years ago, retaining all her brassy defiance and seductive authority. Hynde still knows how to manhandle a rocker and soft-sell a slow number, spitting the seedy lyrics of ""Don't Cut Your Hair"" as deftly as she sings the tender ""Don't Lose Faith in Me"". The title track features her loosest performance, as she dips into the low end of her range and adding some guttural sounds between choruses. That voice demands better material, though. The spiritual lyrics on ""Boots of Chinese Plastic"" don't exactly trip off her tongue, and ""The Nothing Maker"" reaches new depths of meaninglessness: ""He makes nothing,"" she sings on the admiring chorus, ""he's the nothing maker/ He's the maker of nothing."" Sense is obviously one of the many things he doesn't make. The album hinges on the slower tracks: ""Love's a Mystery"" rides its metaphor into true-crime territory, ""The Last Ride"" is a late-in-life reminiscence worthy of Neil Young's Harvest Moon, and closer ""One Thing Never Changed"" is Hynde at her most vulnerable and wounded. The years haven't touched her pipes, but they have changed her outlook, making her not just feistier but a little more straightforward and forgiving. As a result, Break Up the Concrete sounds simultaneously more agitated and more settled, a contradiction that says a lot about Hynde. True, her best and most exciting material may be long behind her, but three decades into her career, she still has a lot to say and-- despite this album's flaws-- a determinedly distinctive way to say it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12294-break-up-the-concrete/,Shangri-La Music,2008.0
320,Miles Davis,Kind of Blue: 50th Anniversary Edition,Jazz,6.6,October 6 2008,Andy Battaglia,,"Miles Davis's Kind of Blue belongs to that special class of album that everybody treasures immediately and then, over time, goes on to process in his or her own terms. For some, it's a masterpiece so resounding in its effect as to make the rest of ""jazz"" extraneous (or at least reasonably deferred until some later point when older or more patient). For others, it's a hallmark whose masterpiece status no amount of further exploration could impugn. Either way, everybody likes it. As Q-Tip says on a documentary included with this new 2xCD/DVD 50th-anniversary set, ""It's like the Bible-- you just have one in your house."" All of that might make Kind of Blue sound kind of boring, and indeed, part of the album's allure owes to the fact that it is among the least immediately radical paradigm-shifters you're ever likely to hear. As another bit on the DVD tells it, this one from the host of the 1950s TV show ""The Robert Herridge Theater"", a serious guy in black-and-white, smoking: ""There are many ways to tell a story, and what you're listening to now-- the music of Miles Davis-- is one of the ways."" Such matter-of-fact understatement suits Kind of Blue, an album that sounds like it's never been in a good mood it didn't consider fleeting or a bad one it couldn't brood its way out of. When Davis and his band commenced recording in 1959, they settled on a new form of ""modal"" jazz that called for improvising through scales as opposed to preordained chord changes. And even if that doesn't sound apparent to an untrained musical ear, it's suggested by a spectral sense of wandering-- an ease with uncertainty that comes across in no uncertain terms. Kind of Blue's rewards get doled out patiently and persistently, from the cool walk of ""So What"" to the magisterial glide of ""Flamenco Sketches"". The tracks that fall between-- ""Freddie Freeloader"", ""Blue in Green"", and ""All Blues""-- cover pretty much everything else. The story of them all is told to good effect in Celebrating a Masterpiece: Kind of Blue, a 55-minute documentary that anchors this new anniversary package-- which also includes a 60-page book and the album on blue vinyl. Nobody with a curious ear has hurt for Kind of Blue-related resources over the years, especially since a remaster in 1997 rescued the sound of it in fantastic fashion. The CD sounds the same in this new package, which pairs Kind of Blue on a disc with an already-released alternate take of ""Flamenco Sketches"" and nine short false-starts and studio bits, none longer than two minutes. Disc 2 cobbles together six earlier recordings by the players responsible for Kind of Blue: Davis, Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. The standout is a 17-minute live recording of ""So What"" played much faster, tighter, and harder than simmering version that went on the finished album. The DVD features the full 26-minute ""Robert Herridge Theater"" show supplementing the documentary, which does an admirable job of taking the album itself as its subject. Some of the drama that surrounded the making of it enters in, but for the most part, the film focuses on how the album works and why. Much of it owes to the whole of the band. But then there's Davis-- an inimitable presence who drummer Cobb, still a bit wowed this many years later, describes as sounding ""like he was sitting on an iceberg somewhere out in the South Pole, alone."" As an album, Kind of Blue is unimpeachable, the kind of record you look forward to listening to decades down the line. As a reissue, this anniversary package (expensive at $109.98) is nice but less than essential, best for completists or those with good record players to put the new vinyl pressing to good use.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12283-kind-of-blue-50th-anniversary-edition/,Columbia Legacy,2008.0
321,Metallica,Death Magnetic,Metal,4.9,September 9 2008,Cosmo Lee,,"Metallica became the world's biggest metal band by doing everything right. Then they went and did everything wrong. Their first four records were classic permutations of 1980s thrash: The ferociously raw Kill 'Em All, the increasingly epic Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets, and the toweringly technical ...And Justice for All. Until the latter, Metallica refused to make an MTV video. Self-dubbed ""Alcoholica"", the band cultivated a blue-collar image. However, on 1991's eponymous album (aka ""The Black Album""), they went mainstream with radio-friendly ballads, losing old fans but gaining millions of new ones.
 
Since then, Metallica have been a comedy of errors. Load and ReLoad wallowed in hard rock dreck. The front of Garage Inc., a covers collection, found Metallica awkwardly costumed as auto mechanics to appear as the everymen they once were. S&M was an overwrought collaboration with a symphony. The band sued Napster, earning the scorn of fans. 2003's St. Anger was laughably bad. The documentary film Some Kind of Monster luridly aired the band's dirty laundry. Singer/guitarist James Hetfield and bassist Robert Trujillo were recently photographed shopping at Armani. Such antics have kept Metallica in the headlines, and not necessarily to their benefit. The anticipation for Death Magnetic has split along two lines: hope for a return to form, and schadenfreude.
 
The album fulfills neither expectation. It tries mightily to recapture Metallica's former glory, but only does so partially. Producer Rick Rubin told the band to write the unwritten half of Master of Puppets, a ludicrous proposition. But his intent was well-meaning: get rich, fortysomething rockers to recall themselves as hungry, twentysomething metallers. In the real world, this is called a midlife crisis. One can emulate one's younger self, but one can't unlearn one's years.
 
So it is with Death Magnetic. Self-plagiarization abounds. ""That Was Just Your Life"" and ""Cyanide"" harken back to ""Blackened"" from ...And Justice for All. ""The Day That Never Comes"" has the clean tones of ""Fade to Black"" and the machine gun riff from ""One"". In the 1980s, Metallica wrote hundreds of riffs without repeating themselves. To hear them so bereft of new ideas is disheartening. So is the fact that Load, ReLoad, and St. Anger are indelibly part of their bloodstream. ""The End of the Line"" and ""The Judas Kiss"" have bland hard rock riffs à la Load and ReLoad. Like most sequels, the turgid ""The Unforgiven III"" need not have been made. ""Cyanide"" tapes a Stone Temple Pilots riff to a disastrous stop-start section straight out of St. Anger. Metallica aren't good at being bluesy or unpredictable. They're best at heavy metal thunder, and they've forgotten that.
 
Rubin's bone-dry production negates this thunder, but it evokes Metallica's garage band days. These are their most energetic performances in ages. Guitarist Kirk Hammett hasn't ever sounded this vital. While he languished solo-less in St. Anger, he's all over Death Magnetic with fiery leads. They often reprise his old ones, but their wah-fueled intensity is a welcome antidote to their underlying riffs. Hetfield has mostly dropped his bluesy yowl in favor of singing in tune. Trujillo adds solid, supportive low end. Drummer Lars Ulrich is the one weak link. He often resorts to simple oompah beats when complementary or counter-rhythms are necessary. But despite his lack of creativity, he plays the hell out of his drums, aided by a harsh, crunchy sound that renders his cymbals incredibly sibilant.
 
All the energy in the world can't save these songs, however. They're each about two minutes too long. Most top seven minutes in length; the instrumental ""Suicide & Redemption"" lasts 10 minutes but feels interminable. Prime Metallica had long songs, but they ebbed and flowed, skillfully playing with layers. These songs, in contrast, merely string together riffs. Clean tones invade ""The End of the Line"" without warning; many songs have intros that are apropos of nothing. Death Magnetic is essentially St. Anger with better riffs.
 
The band may be more mentally stable now, but it's irreparably damaged. Years of simplistic hard rock have destroyed its sense of speed. Even the thrashy ""My Apocalypse"" feels clunky. Hetfield's lyrics are toilet-grade; his younger self, while brash, would never have written tripe like ""Mangled flesh, snapping spines/ Dripping bloody valentine/ Shattered face, spitting glass."" Ever since The Black Album, his lyrics have been embarrassingly personal. Once Metallica became vulnerable, they never recovered. Death Magnetic is a meditation on death-- but so is every other Metallica record. The best ones spit in the face of death; this album instead finds aging men trying to reclaim their youth.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12180-death-magnetic/,Warner Bros.,2008.0
322,Laura Marling,"Alas, I Cannot Swim",Folk/Country,6.8,August 28 2008,Joshua Love,Contributor,"The fact that bracing Brit-folk singer/songwriter Laura Marling was just 17 when she recorded the Mercury Prize-nominated Alas, I Cannot Swim has become every much the bit of biographical shorthand as mentioning Lily Allen's famous dad or Robyn's late-90s U.S. stardom. It may seem at first unfair given how many pubescent rockers come down the pike, but artists who mine a folkier, more personal vein, like Marling or Conor Oberst or Patrick Wolf, do tend to open themselves up to greater scrutiny-- yet are also more readily rewarded with touts of prodigal genius. Such clearly heard, lyric-driven music almost can't help but assume an aim towards profundity regardless of its actual goals. When such striving stumbles, we call it ""precociousness"" and assume the neophyte will continue to hone his or her introspective powers with each passing year. But is this always a good thing, to encourage a young artist of deep feeling to continue burrowing more deeply? The thing I worry about with Marling is that she's already being heralded for evincing wisdom beyond her years-- what happens when the years catch up? Will she feel compelled to keep turning more and more starkly inward, and sacrifice her charm in the process? Lyrically, Alas is a sober document, but its best songs don't demand an abundance of explication or poetics to work their sad-eyed magic. Liking Marling best when she keeps things at the level of teenage romance may sound reductive, but young love is one of pop's bedrocks, and clearly the young songstress can tap into reservoirs of immediacy that a team of balding middle-aged guys crafting expert teen-pop chart-toppers can't as easily manage. As a vocalist Marling may evoke the grown-up weariness of Beth Orton, but the superior first half of Alas is consumed with depictions of decidedly youthful ardor, whether it's the young man in ""Ghosts"" who ""went crazy at 19"" from his inability to escape the memory of past loves, or the general teenage fatalism conveyed in ""Old Stone"" and its refrain, ""10,000 years and you're still on your own."" Marling flashes wit in ""Failure"" in her realization that a once-worshipped rock singer's ""songs were pathetic,"" and the accompanying music of the album's first act admirably matches her heart's cynical but still intense effusions, whether it be the tense gallop of ""Ghosts"", the swelling melancholy strings of ""Tap at My Window"" or the genuine electric momentum of ""You're No God"". Almost perceptibly ""maturing"" before our ears, however, Marling spends much of the record's second half mired in vague symbolism and unfortunate logorrhea, with her music frequently seeming to grind to a halt from the strain. That's not to say Marling lacks the facility to put across complex thoughts and feelings, only that she needn't confuse wordiness with depth, which is just the sort of thinking that leads to groaners like ""the gods that he believes never fail to amaze me"" or ""the sky and I, we've had our fights, and I'm coming 'round to rain,"" which damn near ruins the otherwise lovely and gripping ""The Captain and the Hourglass"". It was a mistake for Marling not to find a place on Alas for ""New Romantic"", a song from an earlier EP that ended up lending two thoroughly inferior tracks to her debut long-player. Instead of the gothic stiltedness of ""Night Terror"" (which has nothing to do with cobras, sorry), ""New Romantic"" finds Marling bemoaning her ""lonesome gait,"" but also worrying about things like being thin and turning into her mother in far more pragmatic terms while reminding us (and herself) that ""I'm still pretty young."" Hopefully, 90s baby Marling will remember there's nothing wrong with this assertion for at least a good little while.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12134-alas-i-cannot-swim/,Virgin,2008.0
323,Nas,Untitled,Rap,3.8,July 16 2008,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"I'd hate to confuse correlation with causation, but the 18 months since Hip Hop Is Dead have gone a long way towards proving Nas wrong. Graduation and Tha Carter III showed that challenging mainstream artists can still produce genuine Billboard blockbusters, the avant-garde has been well-represented by stellar releases by DÃ¤lek, Subtle, and El-P (amongst others), and Jay Electronica (producer of the astounding intro ""Queens Get the Money"") and Wale have emerged as exciting new voices with promising commercial prospects. Even Nas seems to have gotten the message this year, producing an excellent 21st-century record that balances political powder kegs, audacious Escobar floss raps, complementary beats, and genuine inspiration. Unfortunately, that record was the far superior DJ Green Lantern Presents: The Nigger Tape (whose songs are sadly underrepresented here), not Untitled. Not that it's going to matter. Whether Nas intended to actually follow through with his incendiary, original album title, he's been treating his own self-fulfilling martyrdom as the record's main goal. (See the claim on ""Hero"": ""Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, and Billy Joel they can't sing what's in they soul/ So Untitled it is/ I never changed nothing."") Whatever the unfettered vision for the record, through masterful PR work, Nas has given ample reason for listeners to blame everyone but himself for his most cynical and arguably worst album yet. At least Nastradamus was up front about being a shitty crossover bid. The most frustrating thing is that this could have been a solid record. But now, how is Nas going to come off like he intended Untitled to be an unflinching look at race relations and yet somehow leave off the track he did with stic.man? Worse still, the righteous message of ""Association"" (strength through interaction with those who inspire you) is forsaken for the stilted, spoken-word ramblings of ""Testify"", in which Nas accuses white downloaders of being unwilling to ""ride"" with him for whatever reason. And what about the hallucinogenic ""Esco Let's Go"", where he fantasized about ""[writing] hood movies like Posse and Five Heartbeats"" while summoning Elizabeth Taylor for career advice? Instead, we get an elderly German rhyming ""knotty head"" with ""Nazi sled"" (""America""), ""Breathe"" and its boring consumption rhymes (""First I cop/ Then I yacht""-- do go on!), and the gutless ""Make the World Go Round"" in which Nas, Chris Brown, and Cool & Dre top even Fat Joe in terms of trend-hopping insincerity, toasting to ballers, gangstas, hustlas, and the very same ringtone rappers he was willing to throw under the bus just two years ago when it was convenient for his public image. On Untitled you get to decide whether you prefer Nas thoroughly exploring half-assed concepts or half-assedly exploring thorough concepts. Note the distinction: Either he's missing obvious targets or hitting ones not worth aiming at. Peep ""Sly Fox"", a concerted attempt to be the ""She Watch Channel Zero?!"" for conservative news zombies, right down to its steady guitar chug. The main difference is that ""Channel Zero"" risked alienation by confronting its target head on, whereas when it comes to preaching to the choir and picking easy fights, Nas has no problem being the Morgan Spurlock of this rap shit. Speaking of rhymin' for the sake of riddlin'-- ""The Fox has a Bushy tail/ And Bush tells lies and Fox trots, so I don't know what's real."" Which essentially means nothing. More successful is the Busta Rhymes-featuring ""Fried Chicken"", which might actually be the record's strongest cut, but it doesn't take the expected route of cultural subtext, instead working the blues trope of female/food personification. But immediately after, you get the perspective piece ""Project Roach"", and in case Nas' verses somehow went over your head, a Last Poet intones, ""Niggas is like roaches/ We're never gonna go away."" Just because you understand him, it don't mean that he's nice, and just to make sure you're even more confused once the record finally ends, he precedes the suspiciously fence-sitting Obama song (""Black President"") with ""We're Not Alone"", a cashed-bowl musing on extraterrestrial life. As anyone who has followed Nas in the past decade knows, you're not here for the beats. Though he's never been hesitant to enlist the trendiest producers, they're rarely inspired to step up their game; here, it's obvious what the difference is between second-rate Timbaland tracks and something from the new line of pop-savvy super-producers. Particularly in the first half, Untitled is turned into Vice City, where each hired gun coats their tracks with ugly layers of polyester drums, fluorescent synths, and aimless violence. You can distinctly hear Polow Da Don buying into his own hype on ""Hero"", ignoring Nas as a lead instrument and bombing out the mix with pinwheeling keyboard arpeggios and obtrusive unison bends. On previous listens, ""N.I.G.G.E.R. (The Slave and the Master)"" sounded like the record's centerpiece and DJ Toomp's honest approximation of the fat cat lounginess of American Gangster. But check its tinny string section and punchless snares back-to-back with ""Say Hello"", and Toomp's trying to make it rain with nickels. Though many view Illmatic as the gold standard for hip-hop albums, it's abundantly clear that Nas is better off doing anything but trying to recreate it. His best work of the past decade ironically goes against the very concept of traditional album-making (The Lost Tapes, The Nigger Tape). When caught up in the increasingly antiquated promotional cycle, Nas is more likely to rely on ugly manipulation of people who tend to care way more about his work than he apparently does, and accomplish the exact opposite of what he presumptively set out for-- see how Stillmatic took advantage of those who needed to believe that it had equal footing with The Blueprint (illustrated by The Source's hilariously opportunistic 5-mic rating). See how Hip-Hop Is Dead took advantage of people willing to believe that Nas had anything trenchant to say about a game that increasingly sounded like it didn't need him anymore. Thanks to about a half-hour's worth of music made nearly 15 years ago, Nas will never lack a following, and the press battles surrounding Untitled will keep his name hot enough so we can do the same thing all over again in 2010, when he announces the release of his new album, McCain Killa.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12002-untitled/,Def Jam,2008.0
324,David Bowie,Live: Santa Monica '72,Rock,7.7,July 2 2008,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"It seems quaint now to think that illicitly taped shows were once the record industry's greatest foe. These days bootlegs-- particularly bootlegs like Bowie's October 1972 gig in Santa Monica, which enjoy a degree of fan reputation-- aren't the enemy, they're a blessed revenue stream. Santa Monica '72 has had some level of official release before, but this version is repackaged and unlimited: An opportunity for casual fans to experience what is supposedly the best Bowie show on record. The obvious comparison for Santa Monica '72 is Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture: same tour, but a very different document. That album is David Bowie returning to Britain as a conquering hero (and stunning his fans with his apparent retirement)-- this one finds him far from home and still feeling his way into stardom. The Ziggy look and concept-- the jumpsuit, the shock of red hair, the sci-fi glam rock-- had kicked doors open for Bowie in England, but its impact in the USA hadn't been quite so great. Santa Monica '72 is the sound of a cult act pushing hard for breakout success. Bowie had two big advantages in this push: An exceptional backing band in the Spiders from Mars, and four albums worth of very different material to draw on. The combination let him put on a show that could build and twist to keep its audience riveted. If you're familiar with Motion Picture, you'll know that its slow songs get rather lost in the general end-of-tour bombast, with Mike Garson's piano especially suffering. On Santa Monica '72, though, Garson sounds as intimate and effective as any Spider on a mid-set semi-acoustic section that forms the record's slow-burning highlight. Before that the Spiders set their stall out with a brisk ""Hang on to Yourself"" and a snarling ""Ziggy Stardust"". But ""The Supermen""-- Bowie's unearthly vision of future gods-- is where this album really starts to smolder. The bridge into the show's quieter phase, it's stronger and stranger here than on The Man Who Sold the World, with Bowie's disturbing images and Mick Ronson's blurts of caveman guitar playing compellingly off each other. ""The Supermen"" conjures a sense of uncanny menace that carries the singer through intense takes on ""Five Years"" and ""Life on Mars?"", and ensures ""Space Oddity"" retains some power even when Bowie's doing the take-off noises himself. ""Andy Warhol"" is a standout, closing with a hushed, creepy solo, after which Bowie decides to tell an incomprehensible story about a lobster and a palm tree. The crowd and singer laugh nervously: It's endearing, given Bowie's reputation as a showman and manipulator, how gauche all his stage patter on this disc sounds. Bowie's in-song confidence and command, though, is impeccable. Art-rock credentials proven after a 10-minute ""Width of a Circle"", the show's second half is a thrilling space glam rave-up, the kind that sparked Bowie's early fame. Ronson is very much an equal partner, keeping ""Queen Bitch"" and ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" savage while Bowie brings out their catty catchiness. His guitar lines on ""Moonage Daydream"" prowl all over the song, rescuing it from some deeply unconvincing backing vocals. Not everything Bowie tries on Santa Monica works-- I've never liked his overwrought reading of Jacques Brel's ""My Death"" and even this relatively subdued take doesn't change my mind. And his take on the Velvet Underground's ""Waiting for the Man""-- one of the set's rarities-- is too mannered. But the blistering closing tracks chase doubts from your mind. A fierce ""Suffragette City"" sounds more like the Turbonegro version than the Ziggy one, and the freshly-written ""Jean Genie"" is a revelation, sharp and wide-eyed pop rather than the rote glam exercise it became on record. After an hour's roaming through Bowie's early catalogue, he and the Spiders sound giddy with confidence, up for anything. With bootlegs there's often a danger of confusing rarity with quality: whispered fan legends can wither when exposed to commercial sunlight. But as the man says, the beat it comes out better on a stolen guitar, and Santa Monica '72 earns its fan reputation. This is at once a snapshot of a hungry group on terrific form, and a fascinating look at an emergent star.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11947-live-santa-monica-72/,Virgin,2008.0
325,The Beach Boys,U.S. Singles Collection: The Capitol Years (1962-1965),Rock,8.3,June 13 2008,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"There's a historical marker on Interstate 105 in Hawthorne, California, in about the same spot that the Wilsons' childhood home once stood. That's Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, who shared a bedroom into their teens and went on, with their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine (replaced for a time by David Marks), to form a band that's still cemented in the American consciousness 50 years later. Brian Wilson was the driving creative force in the band, taking his love of Chuck Berry, doo-wop and Phil Spector's widescreen L.A. pop sound, adding a large helping of his brother Dennis's surfing hobby and California car culture, and creating a sound all his own. The evolution of that sound is on full display across the 16 discs of Capitol's new U.S. Singles Collection: The Capitol Years, which covers the group's 45 output from 1962 to mid-1965, oddly stopping in the middle of that year without including ""She's Not the Little Girl I Once Knew"" and ""Barbara Ann"". The box is available digitally, but the real draw for fans will be the limited-edition boxed set, which includes a book, 15 singles ,and one ""bonus single,"" each on its own disc with a reproduction sleeve, plus 32 bonus tracks distributed across the set and mostly consisting of alternate stereo mixes. It's a lavish treatment-- definitely not carbon-neutral, but it does have the effect of turning back the clock a bit to a time when listeners had to engage more closely with records, physically changing the disc when the song was over. Brian was 19 when the band formed in 1961 (as the Pendeltones) and just beginning to flex the songwriting and arranging muscles he'd developed in his childhood from watching his father Murray play piano and taking music classes in high school. Though a newly minted adult, he and his band set about building a musical monument to early 60s teen culture that had an odd resonance across the U.S. in spite of its focus on surfing and hot rods, which were very specific to California at the time. It was the soundtrack to the sort of endless summer that a kid in Minnesota or Connecticut could only dream of, and it was packed with enough detail to paint a vivid picture for record-buying kids who had never seen an ocean. This set understandably doesn't include the band's debut single, ""Surfin'"", which was released on the independent X label in late 1961 and managed to hit #75. Instead, it begins with their major label debut, ""Surfin Safari"", backed with ""409"". It was a perfect kick-off, with the band's trademark harmonies setting up both of the band's early obsessions, surfing and fast cars. It's hardly a masterpiece, but the A-side is infectious and creates a perfect mental image of guys in trunks running across the sand with their boards, beach-attired girls behind them. If you grew up in the 60s or around oldies radio in the decades that followed, you undoubtedly have ""Fun, Fun, Fun, ""Little Deuce Coupe"", ""I Get Around"", ""Shut Down"", and ""Surfin' USA"" memorized, but in a lot of ways these songs don't even tell half the story. Even at the very beginning, you can hear Brian Wilson's creative restlessness shining through. The band's second Capitol single, ""Ten Little Indians"" b/w ""County Fair"", is certifiably awful on both sides, but ""County Fair"" makes interesting use of bullhorn-wielding carnies in its arrangement and offers an early hint at some of the uncertainty that would ultimately bubble up through Wilson's work as the girl he goes to the fair with leaves him with another guy, calling him a loser in the process. The early slow songs show an amazingly mature compositional sense. ""Surfer Girl"", with a melody inspired by ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", is a wonderful waltz-time ballad that gives us a spine-tingling early taste of Mike Love's ability to handle slow songs with rich emotion. The song is full of pie-in-the-sky promises and self-conscious reality checks-the protagonist tentatively asks his love interest, ""Do you love me?"" ""In My Room"" leaves behind the surf and exhaust for quiet introspection-- it's hard to imagine a single teenager anywhere in America not being able to identify with wanting a space of one's own in which to brood over the day's drama. The psychological dichotomy of the Beach Boys-- and more specifically Brian Wilson-- is most prominently on display on that 45: ""In My Room"" is the B-side of ""Be True to Your School"", a boastful account of athletic prowess and school spirit that also features an imaginative arrangement complete with cheerleaders. The backing tracks are handled by crack L.A. session players, whose skill gave Wilson wide latitude in his arrangements. Capitol includes an instrumental backing track for ""I Get Around"" a few discs later that is just astounding in its precision and complexity. That song's B-side, ""Don't Worry Baby"", was Wilson's attempt to capture the feel of the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"", his favorite song. Led by his own falsetto vocal, what he wound up with has a different feel, but its sophistication and sweeping melody place it on par with its inspiration nonetheless. By this point it was the middle of 1964 and the band was headed inexorably away from its roots and toward something more enduring and powerful. ""She Knows Me Too Well"" is a heartbreaking and exquisitely arranged song that has Love sifting through his relationship with his girlfriend and essentially finding that while he loves her, he's also a jerk who can't stop himself from hurting her with his roving eye. ""The Warmth of the Sun"" is another tremendous slow song, borrowing its slow 6/8 sway from some of the best doo-wop of the 50s but pointing the way toward Brian Wilson's most ambitious work. In 1964, he was already experimenting with hand percussion, harps, tympanis and other ways to augment the band's sound, but it was at the end of the year, when he quit touring with the band following a nervous breakdown, that Wilson truly became free to expand on his ideas as he wanted to. He'd felt pressure from the British Invasion to innovate for over a year, and it's hard to argue against what he came up with. B-sides ""Please Let Me Wonder"" and ""Kiss Me, Baby"", neither of which charted, are both pretty enough to raise the hair on the back of your neck, but both were lost on the flip sides of mega-hits, the latter attached to ""Help Me Rhonda,"" the band's second #1. These discs chart an amazingly steady build-up to the final single they catalog, ""California Girls"" b/w ""Let Him Run Wild"". Though there will always be debate as to the worth of the A-side's lyrics, the music, a stately stomp that sets jaunty organ to dissonant horns, swinging bass and multiple tambourines, is undeniable. In July of 1965, it was a Technicolor re-affirmation of the endless summer, but don't forget the B-side. ""Let Him Run Wild"" is nearly as good and a clear sonic blueprint for Pet Sounds. This box is an interesting look at the warts-and-all development of America's Band, though I hesitate to call it essential for anyone but the band's most dedicated and invested fans. Apart from a live version of ""409"" recorded in Chicago after Brian Wilson had stopped touring, all eight previously unreleased tracks are alternate mixes, so there are no major revelations. To that end, it's more the object that commands the price, and it is a very attractive object. For the more casual listener, though, there are plenty of other ways to obtain these singles.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11603-us-singles-collection-the-capitol-years-1962-1965/,Capitol,2008.0
326,Lil Wayne,Tha Carter III,Rap,8.7,June 12 2008,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"""Where the fuck is my guitar?"" Lil Wayne is a terrible guitarist. Just incredibly bad. The fact was evident at this year's Summer Jam, when he spent two and a half interminable minutes noodling and crooning all by his lonesome while a stadium full of New York's most devout hip-hop fans looked on bewildered. ""Is he really playing the guitar right now?"" giggled a teenage girl. ""That's not a chord or anything!"" Still, she recorded Wayne in all his tatted-up Tracy Chapman glory for YouTube posterity just the same. While everyone else on the day's bill-- from Alicia Keys to Kanye West-- filled their shortened, festival-style sets with hits and finely-tailored theatrics, the audience's most anticipated act took the opportunity get his Guitar for Dummies on; Lil Wayne is, as he likes to say, ""different."" Always has been. Earmarked as a gifted elementary school student in New Orleans, he became the token prodigy of his hometown's Cash Money clique at the age of 16, spitting pipsqueak gangsterisms over skittering Mannie Fresh beats. And, opposed to the typical rap flame-out trajectory, Wayne got better-- and stranger-- with each album. Now, nine years after his first solo LP, and on the heels of an unprecedented glut of increasingly remarkable mixtape and internet leaks, we get Tha Carter III, the epic culmination of a lifetime of eccentricities. This is Wayne's moment and he embraces it on his own terms. Instead of hiding his bootleg-bred quirks in anticipation of the big-budget spotlight, he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package that's as weird as it wants to be; he eventually finds his guitar but keeps the strumming in check. ""I pay my dues, you keep the difference."" As the major music industry continues to wheeze and splinter, Lil Wayne's spitball marketing plan for C3 is an unprecedented masterstroke. Over the past couple of years, he's given away more worthwhile free music online than most artists of his stature ever release officially. Using the mixtape market as a free-for-all training ground, Wayne expanded his persona, voice, and talent while presumptively killing off thousands of wannabe MCs hoping to charge five bucks for some garbage CD-R. For that alone, he deserves thanks. Wayne set the definition for a Web 2.0 MC-- his output pours through computer speakers at broadband speeds. And while stellar tapes like Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 offered-up plenty of hidden darts for sun-deprived message board nerds, his Just Say Yes policy toward any and all guest invitations (Enrique Iglesias? Why not!) provided maximum visibility and chiseled his radio-friendly chops. Piggybacking on hits by Chris Brown and Lloyd undoubtedly did wonders for his giggling teenage girl fan base, but a lesser-known assist appears to have had an even bigger effect on the new record. ""Gotta work everyday/ Gotta not be clichÃ©/ Gotta stand out like Andre 3K."" One of the few satisfying tracks on OutKast's bungled Idlewild album was a woozy bitchfest called ""Hollywood Divorce"" featuring Lil Wayne. In hindsight, the invite feels like an act of sanctification. The song's a lesson in winning idiosyncrasies-- Andre, Big Boi, and Wayne are all salty, but they make sure to side-step pessimism (Big Boi deems rumor mongers ""M&M's with no nuts""). Traces of the South's most genre-bursting, P-Funk-worshipping ATLiens can be heard all over C3, from Wayne's staccato phrasing on ""Mr. Carter"" to the extraterrestrial fetishism of ""Phone Home"" to the eclectic unpredictability of it all. The musical open-mindedness also lifts C3 above regional niches-- the #1 hit ""Lollipop"" sounds more like it was born on Jupiter than anywhere on earth. While Wayne isn't quite ready to produce something like ""Hey Ya!"", don't be shocked if you see him held up by a pair of leprechaun suspenders in the not-so-distant future. ""I've done it before, please don't make me do it no more."" C3 is Wayne's most absurd album to date but it's also his most personal. ""Shoot Me Down"", with its ""Lose Yourself""-style guitar chug and ominous hook, has the rapper looking all the way back to age 12, when he accidentally shot himself with a .44 Magnum while toying with the gun in a mirror. ""Two more inches I'd have been in that casket/ According to the doctor I could've died in traffic,"" he rhymes on ""3 Peat"", possibly referring to the day in 2001 when a disgruntled groupie shot at his tour bus, planting a bullet in his chest. Such details add even more gravitas to his grizzled, elastic timbre, which suggests an impossibly hoarse (and high) David Ruffin at times. ""All I ask is don't take our love for granted,"" sings a perfectly sympathetic Babyface alongside Wayne on the lush ballad ""Comfortable"", the line coming off more like a saucer-eyed plea than a threat. And the LP's best track doubles as its most crazed and pained. ""Playing With Fire"" is a full-on faux-metal stunner that hearkens back to Bad Boy's cinematic peak. On it, Wayne reaches Ghostface levels of paranoid distress: ""I'm doin' the same shit Martin Luther King did/ Checkin' in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch/ Same balcony like assassinate me, bitch!"" His claims of MLK grandeur are far-fetched, but his impassioned delivery makes them seem more believable than one would think possible. Apparently, those Biggie and Pac references are getting to his codeine-addled brain-- after all, at 25, Wayne is now older than both legends were when they were gunned down. The implicit danger of carrying on such a legacy only adds to the rapper's dramatic reading, and his anguish burns as hot as his punchlines. ""I think everybody gonna like this one...I got one!"" Considering his running-faucet leak rate, there are bound to be fanboy quibbles about the intricacies of C3's tracklist (e.g., the buoyant web gem ""La La La"" should replace ""La La"" and its braindead Busta Rhymes verse, and what about the hazy ""I Feel Like Dying"" or the promising speed-soul track ""3 a.m.""?). But considering there are probably several hard drives stuffed with syrupy odes featuring Wayne's dubious auto-tuned howl, the final tally is exquisitely balanced and considered. After dozens of listens, the record's overflowing minutiae-- from Fabulous and Juelz Santana's overachieving cameos to Wayne's hilariously apropos kinship with ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage-- still feels limitless. Just as the record's cover playfully skews the Ready to Die/Illmatic baby-picture formula with Photoshopped tattoos, Wayne updates what it means to be the best rapper alive here. Gangster dandy. Fender-slinging sex god. Intergalactic prankster. It's all in him.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11608-tha-carter-iii/,Cash Money,2008.0
327,My Morning Jacket,Evil Urges,Rock,4.7,June 9 2008,Eric Harvey,Contributor,"In interviews, Jim James has said he doesn't want My Morning Jacket to remain creatively static, or become victim to the sort of bland-ification that befalls so many lesser groups that emerge through the jam and festival circuits. He's lived up to his end of the bargain: A clear and wonderful upward trajectory can be easily mapped over the band's first decade, as their fanbase and creative scope expanded with the crowds and lineups at Bonnaroo, a festival with which they'll forever be linked. As they grew, they pared back indulgences (like the thick song lengths of It Still Moves) and allowed fresh ideas to infiltrate (the first third of Z) while retaining a sonic identity distinctive enough to influence legions of worthy followers. Their 2005 psych/prog wonder Z-- not so much their Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as their The Soft Bulletin-- broke sharply with the Muscle Shoals might of Moves, but 2006's wonderful live double-album Okonokos re-framed and affirmed My Morning Jacket as what fans and critics had been saying since At Dawn: This is one of America's preeminent contemporary rock bands. My Morning Jacket's latest album, Evil Urges, ends the mean streak the band's been on since 2000, and threatens to squander some of the widespread goodwill they've been steadily building along the way. There are few fiery guitar freakouts, folk-influenced melodies, soaring space-rock bridges, or psychedelic flourishes here; instead, the empty space is mostly filled with serviceable falsetto funk and glassy-eyed soft rock. Worse still is the band's decision to ignore the perfect past incarnations of James' Orbisonian tenor-- easily MMJ's most appealing component and one of the more breathtaking instruments in modern rock. At best, his voice is sorely underutilized here; at worst, it's mangled beyond recognition. After listening to Urges, I wonder if My Morning Jacket might just be satisfied following in the footsteps of labelmates Dave Matthews Band: nestling into a comfortable niche and aiming for the Starbucks carousel with rootsy New Age romanticism. Any discussion of this record has to start with the eye-poppingly annoying ""Highly Suspicious"", a loud thud ending any chance Urges had to match the group's previous records. An attempt to merge the band's penchant for live quirkiness with James' long-simmering Prince fixation, the track sounds like My Morning Jacket's version of a Phish novelty. The song reduces James' voice to a grating squeak, which cowers in the presence of the obnoxious, caricatured chorus. Its libertarian undertones (""Wasting all your time on drama/ Could be solving real crime"") sound like they could stretch to resonate with the hydroponic crowd or those who fret about warrantless wiretapping, but I cringe thinking of an entire amphitheatre singing along to ""peanut-butter pudding surprise"" unless they're at a Ween show. At the moment, even a not-very-political band like My Morning Jacket can't resist using their biggest stage yet for a bit of message-driven oratory. James has said, ""Evil Urges is about how all of these things that you've been told are evil really aren't, unless they're actually hurting something or somebody."" Cool, but the title track, a lighter version of ""Suspicious"", neuters a righteous sentiment by burying it underneath a jammy funk pastiche. The simultaneously effortless and calculated ""I'm Amazed"" is breezy and naÃ¯ve enough to trigger the unconscious sing-along reflex, but the refrain (""Where's the justice?"") is ambiguous. Similarly, ""Look at You"" wastes a perfectly good pedal-steel on a goofy hybrid of the sensual and civic, praising ""a fine citizen"" as ""such a glowing example of peace and glory,"" as if James were a state senator awarding citations to volunteers. ""Sec Walkin'""s refrain of ""demon eyes are watchin' everywhere"" may address his existential angst at omnipresent security, but the song's Quaalude-smooth soul vibe-- for real, it's a Grover Washington sax solo away from the PA system at Von Maur-- make it seem more like he's content to just keep on truckin'. Soft rock isn't an irredeemable genre category, and there are some pretty good singles that have been tagged with it. James and his band have professed their affection for such sensitivity in the past, on tracks like ""I Will Sing You Songs,"" which successfully filtered a timid emotional tone within the band's own style. Not so much here. In a live context, prefaced with an extended ironic monologue, ""Make It With You"" is fun. On record, several times over, from a singer more accustomed to disguising his elliptical, oft-nonsensical lyrics with grain-silos full of reverb, it's incongruous and awkward. ""Thank You Too!"", with syrupy strings courtesy of arranger-to-the-stars David Campbell, is readymade for the bride and groom's slow dance (save the line ""you really brought out the naked part""). The strings trill, dramatically rising and falling on the loner's fantasy ""Librarian"", as James quietly crushes on, and quietly stalks, the female behind the desk, turned on by her listening to ""Karen of the Carpenters"" on AM radio. It sounds like a very well-produced Dan Fogelberg song, until James drops ""interweb"" on us like a sack of dirty socks. Thankfully, there's no couplet about him texting her on his ""Crackberry"" lol. Still, James' tender side also leads to Urges' best moments, which bookend the album. Nicely sequenced after the title track at the start of the record, ""Touch Me I'm Going to Scream, Pt. 1"" is the perfect sequel to Z's sly ""It Beats 4 U"", down to the songs' similarly insistent, live/synthetic drum patter, and the way they isolate James' voice in a chilly emotional purgatory, only to be cracked with passion: ""I need a human by my side, untied"" is vulnerability done right. James is smart enough to know when he's got something good, and he ends Urges with an eight-and-a-half minute dark disco reprise of ""Touch Me"", slowly taking shape as the solemn, steady ""Smokin' From Shootin'"" fades out. With its patient, synthetic gleam slithering around James' lusty hoodoo, ""Touch Me, Pt. 2"" is My Morning Jacket's Moroder moment, bringing a highly frustrating record to a close with the line ""Oh, this feeling is wonderful/ Don't turn it off."" If it hadn't been such an exhausting ride to get there, I might not want to.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11585-evil-urges/,ATO,2008.0
328,Radiohead,The Best Of,Rock,4.0,June 5 2008,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"The week after Radiohead's OK Computer was released in the U.S., it debuted in the album charts at #21; bowing at #1 was the Prodigy's The Fat of the Land. In the U.S., the Prodigy were heralded as the bellwethers for electronica, while, in the face of this newly cobbled-together marketing schematic-- and exponentially rising sales of country and hip-hop-- Radiohead were charged by some with the task of ""saving"" rock music. Oddly, the two records seemed to have opposite effects. Throughout the late 1990s and early 00s, Thom Yorke practically functioned as a Warp publicist, embracing the possibilities and future of electronic music but retaining the charisma, scope, and grandeur of pop and, in the process, helping to expose rock fans to electronic textures and sounds. Meanwhile, the Prodigy-- along with Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, and Korn-- inadvertently spawned the well-selling mook rock. Four years later, Radiohead had pushed too far in the ""wrong"" direction: The band's next two albums-- Kid A and Amnesiac-- strayed far left of the organic and ""authentic"" (read: instruments carved from wood) for many of those same people who had exalted the group the previous decade. Critics faced with having to either step outside of their historical comfort zones and recalibrate their sensibilities or retreat back to the familiar took the easy road and embraced a New Rock Revolution that, in the U.S., never came to fruition. In the wake of it all, Radiohead themselves retreated from the spotlight, becoming the sort of arena-sized DIY band that, oddly, Pearl Jam morphed into during the previous decade, and eventually leaving their record label, Capitol, altogether. Capitol's eventual response is, quite naturally, to collect the group's older material in a more pocket-sized package. To its credit, the label is going all-out with these releases, offering not only two different CD or digital versions of the set (a 17-track single disc or a 30-track 2xCD package), but also a 4xLP vinyl version that could be a nice addition to a fan's collection and pretty kickass DVD that even casual observers should love. Make no mistake then, the middling and low scores up there don't reflect a general dissatisfaction with the notion of carving up Radiohead's albums (though both the flow of Kid A and the tension of Amnesiac are masterstrokes of pacing), the very idea of career-spanning compilations, or even these records being compiled without the band's participation-- for one thing, avoiding the DVD on those grounds would be foolish. (And to be fair to Capitol, the label always seemed highly supportive of Radiohead, investing plenty of resources and marketing into their records-- especially OK Computer and Kid A.) No, it's much more utilitarian than that: Namely, for whom are these records meant? The question is easier to answer for the single-disc version, which functions as a Radiohead sampler. A crisp, 17-track collection, it features the band's most well-liked singles, plus Kid A tracks ""Idioteque"", ""Everything in Its Right Place"", and ""Optimistic"" (remember, there were no singles pulled from that LP), plus the title track to The Bends. All told it's a murderer's row-- ""Paranoid Android"", ""Lucky"", ""Pyramid Song"", ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", ""No Surprises"", ""Creep"", the aforementioned Kid A tracks, and many more. Only the sleepy ""High and Dry"" and requisite Hail to the Thief representative ""2+2=5"" are relative duds. If you've turned away from Radiohead this decade or if you aren't hooked by the more abstract pieces they've made since OK Computer, it's a good way to catch up. The tracks themselves are a 10, and if you're actually curious but unfamiliar with the group, by all means buy it. Yet even saying that, this isn't a band with a winding, difficult discography to navigate, and 10 of these 17 tracks are from The Bends and OK Computer. Assuming CDs exist in the near future, I suspect this compilation will become more useful in years to come, when younger listeners who haven't engaged with Radiohead throughout most of the group's lifetime want a place to sort out what the fuss is about. For the rest of us, it's just not needed. The 2xCD version, although a better value-for-money, does even less to justify its existence. Starting rather cleverly with ""Airbag"" and ""I Might Be Wrong"", aka the two lead tracks from Capitol's in-print Radiohead mini-LPs (hint, hint), it goes on to add another seven tracks from the 1995-2003 albums (great songs, but most of them weaker than the ones on CD1), a pair of clunkers from 1993 debut Pablo Honey, and the only two things here that come close to being rare: The B-side ""Talk Show Host"" and the live acoustic solo Thom Yorke version of ""True Love Waits"" from the previously hinted-at I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings-- the only other time that song has appeared on record in any form. The packaging is merely a few promo photos and a long essay I didn't read (sorry). With little rhyme or reason to the songs that fill out this second disc, it becomes even more disappointing that a bonus isn't given over to an alternate view of the group-- B-sides or rarities, a collection which would be of great use, or their more adventurous work. Instead, this compilation is dominated by a pair of central ideas of what Radiohead sound like: emotionally nourishing, impressionistic balladeers, or crunchy, tech- and texture-savvy rockers. The outliers, moments when the band has dabbled more in mood, atmosphere, or a love of pure sound-- think ""Kid A"", ""Climbing Up the Walls"", or exquisite Amnesiac tracks like the clanging ""Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box"", the prescient paranoia of ""Life in a Glasshouse"", the unsettlingly gorgeous ""Like Spinning Plates"", or the punchdrunk ""You and Whose Army?""-- aren't represented at all. (Weirdly, I don't miss anything from Hail to the Thief, a collection of songs that works better live than on record.) So, sure, artistically this could be a much stronger 2xCD set, but it's rightfully in Capitol's interest to spread the love and highlight all of the band's releases, each of which the label has a monetary stake in promoting. The latest Radiohead album, In Rainbows, is of course not one of them. Radiohead's decision to first self-release that record was heralded as an early warning sign that the major-label system was faltering. In truth, it's more of a late sign: With so little creative energy engaged in the hope and promise of making grand, heroic rock music-- and so few reliable, national delivery systems for it now that MTV and radio have become increasingly marginal-- the guitar set is still, incredibly, mostly left with warmed-over sounds from the 90s (on modern rock radio) or earlier (everyone else). It's no wonder that New Rock Revolution, itself mostly revivalism, had so many ardent cheerleaders. Radiohead's purposeful retreat from the spotlight-- leaving Capitol Records; the patronage-like, ""we leak, you pay"" pricing policy that accompanied the announcement of In Rainbows-- returned them briefly to the headlines but did little to place their actual music in the public consciousness on any grand, communicative scale. (""Bodysnatchers"" was a semi-hit on modern rock radio.) Less than a decade after Radiohead invigorated critics and many listeners by becoming one of the few contemporary bands willing to both strive to reach a mass audience and cast its eyes to the corners and cracks of the pop landscape, they had become another niche group in a world full of them. What's more, the mechanics and poor health of the music industry-- with Radiohead, Trent Reznor, and others now experimenting with communicating directly to the faithful rather than to any and all potential listeners-- mean we may never see another platinum-selling rock group like this again. It's no surprise then that the music industry's response is to repackage and recycle, as quickly as possible.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11686-the-best-ofthe-best-of-special-edition/,"Capitol,Capitol",2008.0
329,The Roots,Rising Down,Rap,7.8,April 29 2008,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"It's gotten to the point where I can't even imagine the Roots being soft anymore. Not to be dismissive of their first few albums, which were thoughtful without being mushy or maudlin, but their three recent records-- the underrated/overhated alleged-sellout The Tipping Point, the Def Jam-released tightly knit return to rawness Game Theory, and now Rising Down-- are so singularly focused on a kind of distilled, uninhibited force that it's now difficult to think of the Roots as anything but intelligently aggressive firebrands. You don't throw on these albums if you want to chill out, and Rising Down does more than any of them to express, precisely and without compromise, a specifically African-American but increasingly universal strain of anxiety and frustration. A lot of Rising Down's urgency and immediacy owes to the massive guest roster. The Roots' Philly core of affiliates-- vets Dice Raw, Peedi Peedi, and Truck North, former member Malik B., and relative newcomer/search engine nightmare P.O.R.N.-- appear on more than half the record's songs, and they help give the record a sense of a communal strength in numbers; their appearances on vicious throwdown ""Get Busy"" (with the some deft cuts from Philly's legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff) and a stretch of tracks in the middle (""I Will Not Apologize"", ""I Can't Help It"", and ""Singing Man"") feel like the spiritual and lyrical core of the album. The guests from outside Philly work just as well: Talib Kweli spits with an atypically growly delivery on the anti-defeatist anthem ""Lost Desire"", Common displays glimpses of his late-1990s shine ruminating over tour fatigue on ""The Show"", Wale kills it with some so-corny-they're-great metaphors (""good rappers ain't eatin', they Olsen twinnin'"") on ""Rising Up"", and Saigon's final verse on ""Criminal"" is the fierce peak of a three-MC slow lyrical burn. And while Styles P's turn on the title track works well enough (it's something to hear the dude behind ""Good Times [I Get High]"" go after the pharmaceutical industry), Mos Def's verse-- the first one on the whole record-- is one of the best he's ever done, and probably the best guest spot on Rising Down: ""Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds/ Blindin', staring at lights till they cryin'/ Bone gristle popping from continuous grindin'."" But despite the massive ensemble cast, Black Thought is still the core of the record and the well-worn accusations of him being anti-charismatic feel largely false here. Most of his great moments come on tracks which feature a lot of other MCs' great moments, and after getting overshadowed on ""Rising Down"" (can any MC make the subject of global warming into a dope lyric?) he comes out swinging for the rest of the record. On ""Singing Man"", even with P.O.R.N. portraying himself as a vividly realized school shooter and Truck North putting together a disturbingly evocative characterization of a suicide bomber, Black Thought's depiction of an African child soldier justifying his violence (""13 year-old killer, he look 35/ He changed his name to Little No Man Survive"") is both sharply written and unsettling. His delivery is a bit more varied than you might expect, too, particularly when he's rapping about getting underpaid like he's got a clenched jaw in ""I Will Not Apologize"" or sweating his way through a pills-and-stress panic attack on ""I Can't Help It"". And when he's turned loose on a hookless lyrical exhibition, Black Thought is nearly unstoppable; it's scary the way he blazes through the one-take assault of ""75 Bars (Black's Reconstruction)"", throwing out endless Big Daddy Kane-level proclamations of untouchability (""My hustle is long, my muscle is strong, my man put the paper in the duffel I'm gone/ Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on/ Just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm""). The abrupt way it ends, it sounds like he could've gone on full throttle for another two hundred bars if someone hadn't taken a cleaver to the tape reel. A revamped production style accompanies the deeper, darker lyrical tone, taking the aesthetic of Game Theory to its grimiest conclusion. Most of Kamal's keyboard work here isn't with the archetypal Fender Rhodes of Roots albums past; he's using a number of grimy analog synths that snarl and spit and hiss, the kind you hear in dead prez's ""Hip Hop"" or Outkast's ""Stanklove"" (or the J.B.'s' ""Blow Your Head"", for that matter). That racket combining with ?uestlove's fierce, crisp percussion makes for some diabolical rhythmic low-end, and since it dominates Rising Down's personality it gives the album the feeling of being this bionic monstrosity that just so happens to have a lot of headknock to it. There are a couple of exceptions, like the guitar-driven midtempo Fela pastiche of ""I Will Not Apologize"" and the unexpected country-blues tinge to ""Criminal"", but they're rare breathers in an album that otherwise closes in on you. Only when the triumphant, old-school Roots return on the demi-go-go of ""Rising Up"" does it feel like the weight's been lifted, and even then something about it-- the endless Oprah/Travolta namedrop hook, the mawkish Chrisette Michele vocal about a crying b-girl, the overly tidy-sounding keyboards-- seems a bit out of place. (Maybe not as out-of-place as the now-infamous and super-creepy Patrick Stump collab ""Birthday Girl"", however; excising that disaster singlehandedly saved the album's character.) Rising Down isn't always an easy listen, but it's an exciting one, and its abrasiveness never gets in the way of a good throw-your-hands-up beat or a well-crafted lyric. If you've been paying any damn attention to the world around you, most of Rising Down's messages ring familiar, and frequently true: This is an album that tells you the entertainment industry is turning into a coon show, the climate (both environmental and cultural) is getting fucked up, and broke people are still struggling. But this record states these ideas with respect to the notion that you know them already, and puts all the revelation and subtext into its unyielding sound. You could call it preaching to the converted, but it also feels like a reminder to the lapsed, less a wake-up call than a shot of renewed adrenaline.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11458-rising-down/,Def Jam,2008.0
330,James Brown,"The Singles, Volume Five: 1967-1969",Rock,7.9,April 8 2008,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"James Brown was brilliant and terrible, a breathtaking innovator and an inept imitator, and even at his peak you never knew which he was going to be on any given day. The fifth volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only comprehensive collection of his singles catches him at both his extremes. These 43 tracks include 11 chart hits, some of them as good as anything anybody recorded in the 1960s-- ""I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)"", ""Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud"", and the unbelievable, skeletal vamp ""Give It Up or Turnit a Loose"", which Alan Leeds' liner notes point out is full of instrumental errors, but, as Leeds puts it, ""what's wrong with a couple fumbles if the team wins the game?"" Some of the other hits, though, you may not have heard of, perhaps with good reason: the undistinguished ballads ""I Guess I'll Have to Cry, Cry, Cry"" and ""Goodbye My Love"", and especially ""America Is My Home"", a patriotic recitation that got him in as much trouble with the Left as his July 1968 tour of Vietnam to entertain troops. (He promptly won radicals back with ""Say It Loud,"" the hottest anthem of the Black Power movement-- which he stopped playing live a few months later.) The great side of Brown-- aphoristic, emphatic, so rhythmically sharp he could slice diamonds with a grunt-- had two insanely awesome bands in the period documented here. One was his touring group, led by Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis; the other was a white funk band from Cincinnati, the Dapps, who dropkicked ""I Can't Stand Myself"" out of the stadium. Their bassist Tim Drummond subsequently joined the Ellis ensemble for a while (and went on to play with Bob Dylan during his born-again period), and Brown noted that ""Tim's not a white bass player, he's my bass player."" Both the Dapps and the James Brown Band cranked out instrumental singles during this period, sometimes identified by each other's names, and usually working variations on J.B.'s hits: ""Bringing Up the Guitar"" revives a groove from ""Cold Sweat"" (and would later turn into ""The Popcorn""), ""Gittin' a Little Hipper"" does the same for ""Get It Together"", the two-part ""Shades of Brown"" recalls ""Ain't That a Groove"", ""Believers Shall Enjoy (Non Believers Shall Suffer)"" is a vamp from ""Maybe the Last Time"". This set also includes a pair of killer two-part instrumentals, ""Soul Pride"" and ""In the Middle"", on which Soul Brother #1 doesn't actually play. And then there's the embarrassing side of James Brown: the megalomaniac who thought he was a great keyboard player... or a good keyboard player. A lot of his singles at the time featured instrumental B-sides with piano or organ overdubs by Brown, and he had a habit of mixing his part to be twice as loud as the rest of the band. That might be acceptable if he didn't play more clams than a barrel of chowder: the two-part ""Maybe Good, Maybe Bad"" is far too optimistically titled, and he seems to keep forgetting what key ""Here I Go"" is in. As with every volume in the series, though, there are some peculiar, lesser-known wonders here. 1968's trio of Christmas singles (banged out in three days in October) includes a fabulous little jam called ""Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto"", and the Bobby Byrd duet ""Licking Stick - Licking Stick"" points toward the spiky cross-chatter of his 1970 band. Even better is ""You Got to Have a Job"", a January 1969 duet with his companion from the Vietnam trip, soul howler Marva Whitney. The two of them call for saxophonist Maceo Parker to solo-- the same trick Brown had used as far back as ""Cold Sweat"" (mid-1967 was an eternity ago, at the speed his music was evolving). But they keep crowing ""Maceo!"" back and forth at each other, just for the joy of showing off their loud, glorious powers.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11275-the-singles-volume-five-1967-1969/,"Hip-O Select,Hip-O",2008.0
331,The Black Keys,Attack & Release,Rock,7.5,April 1 2008,Roque Strew,,"The Black Keys seemed doomed to linger in the long, black-and-red shadow of the White Stripes. That's perhaps unfair: Akron's Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney have perfected their own brand of Delta-tinged, garage minimalism. But after four albums, even they seemed to realize they had hit a creative wall. Luckily, in 2007, they were tapped by producer Danger Mouse for a collaboration with Ike Turner, though when he passed away last December, the project left the duo with a host of material. This became the foundation of their fifth and most adventurous album to date. Maneuvering between the King of Rhythm's joie de vivre and their crestfallen, crossroads-blues heritage, Attack and Release subtly expands the Black Keys sound. An auteur raised on hip-hop, DM keeps the record from staying overly loyal to the Creedence or Free templates. This is a small but crucial difference from 2006's Magic Potion. He colors the band's no-frills narratives with futuristic accents or, on the opposite end, rural flourishes of psychedelia and folk. On each track they add a bolt of surprise that amplifies the pitch-black mood and message. Take the flutes and feedback of ""Same Old Thing"", which in combination suggest a childlike innocence peeled away by a cold, indifferent world. Likewise, a tension opens between the peppy xylophone and world-weary, Waitsian tremolo on ""So He Won't Break"". Longtime Waits and Elvis Costello guitarist Marc Ribot lends his powers to this song and to the anguished 6/8 masterpiece ""Lies"". Here (and elsewhere: ""Psychotic Girl"", ""I Got Mine"", ""Strange Times"") Danger Mouse's layer of backing vocals imbue these earthly stories with a beyond-the-grave air, taking lost-love themes to an eerily literal but quintessentially blues-y level. The unexpected organ line of ""All You Ever Wanted"" feels like a police ambush on this jilted-John ballad. We almost forget that, in light of the band's uniformly lo-fi discography, nearly every fresh sound on Attack & Release should strike us as alien. A sequence of slow burns, the record's tempos allow you to relish the details and the textures. ""Remember When (Side A)"", with its eddies of reverb, envisions nostalgia as something dim and meticulously crafted, with a touch of the fantastic. Speaking of the past, the raw, amplified wallop of the Black Keys' old days is still here, too. Given that Ike Turner was partly responsible for rock'n'roll's love affair with distortion, it would have been wrong for Attack & Release to discard fuzzy riffs. The other side of ""Remember When"" will sooth anyone longing for their sinewy Nuggets rave-ups. Fans of previous BK records will find this song and the first single, ""Strange Times"", the bluntest weapons here. ""Things Ain't Like They Used to Be"" leads the album to a grim finish. Auerbach's sluggish, hung-over melodies, echoed by teenage protégé Jessica Lea Mayfield's distant singing, carry an air of defeat. Addressed to an old lover, the lyrics describe a happier past, overgrown yards, a man blindly walking into battles, and other ingredients of lament. Yet Carney and Auerbach know that there's more to the blues than bad news. These men are stoics to the fingertips. ""It doesn't mean a thing to me,"" Auerbach repeats on the chorus. The jaded ex of ""Same Old Thing"" speaks the same language: ""It don't matter where you been."" We know better.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11358-attack-release/,Nonesuch,2008.0
332,Snoop Dogg,Ego Trippin',Rap,6.6,March 14 2008,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Snoop Dogg was more famous for being famous than for rapping long before the E! network gave him a reality show. His pimp persona hardened into shtick at least a decade ago, and music has felt like an afterthought for him ever since he embarked on an endless run of stoner-comedy cameos. The dangerous urgency and viciously charismatic lean of his early Doggystyle peak are distant memories. And yet he's somehow managed to evolve into a model of gangsta consistency, a sort of rap version of Tom Petty or Alan Jackson. He cranks out lazy, effortless hits at a scary clip, slightly tweaking his formula as the musical climate changes without ever leaving his comfort zone. On ""Neva Have 2 Worry"", the fifth track of his ninth album, Snoop reminds us that he ""ain't never went gold""; every one of those previous eight albums sold a million copies. Those numbers are worldwide, not domestic, but still. He's doing something right. ""Neva Have 2 Worry"" is a lean autobiographical track, but it's not a frustrated emo-memoir like Nas' ""Last Real Nigga Alive"" or Bun B's ""The Story"". Snoop doesn't do self-disclosure. Rather than giving us inside glimpses of his triumphs and failures, Snoop calmly recites his accomplishments, taking quick pauses to remind us of his murder trial and to defend himself from accusations of misogyny by kicking more misogyny. We don't learn anything from ""Neva Have 2 Worry"", but it sounds great: Snoop's craggy sing-song purr sinking deep into his own lush, smooth, low-key track. It doesn't reward close attention, but it fills the air beautifully. That's true of almost all of Ego Trippin'. Snoop says basically nothing new over the course of the album's way-excessive 21 tracks, but he usually sounds good saying it, and the expansive, expensive production gives him the sort of luxuriant bed that few rappers can afford anymore. First single ""Sexual Eruption"" might find Snoop cooing though one of T-Pain's vocoders and extolling the virtues of bedtime reciprocity, but those tweaks are subtle; it's not like Snoop is diving headlong into feminism or electro. Rather, the slight, unremarkable track seems to exist mostly as an excuse for its retro-VHS video than as a song in its own right. That video is the best thing Snoop's done in years, a better vehicle for his sly, self-aware persona than any of the songs on this album. And yet there's something encouraging about endless confidence and professionalism on display here. In a time when the rap industry is in serious money-drain tumult, Snoop sounds as unperturbed as ever, and better for it. Many of the tracks on Ego Trippin' come from some iteration of the newly-formed QDT, a production trio of Snoop, new jack swing architect and former Blackstreet frontman Teddy Riley, and g-funk architect and former convict DJ Quik. All of these guys are pros, and it's great to hear Snoop using his enviable position to play patron to those two underrated pop veterans. Quik's beat for ""Press Play"" is all fluid soul-rap, its Isley Brothers sample twittering gorgeously over its rippling guitars and horn-stabs. And on ""SD Is Out"", Riley somehow pulls off the neat trick of crafting a lush snap beat, its spare production absolutely at home in its pillowy layers of bass and vocoders. But tracks as pretty as these can't erase the sad reality that Snoop is running through trite pimp-life clichÃ©s for the billionth time, talking about macking hoes with Leonardo DiCaprio and never quite sounding enthused about the women he's reportedly fucking. Even the love song he dedicates to his wife turns out to be more about Snoop's globe-trotting exploits than anything resembling actual sentiment. So it comes as a relief whenever Snoop deviates from his usual talking-points to give us the odd stylistic curveball. And those curveballs can often be pretty great on their own merits, as when Snoop covers the Time's Minneapolis new-wave funk manifesto ""Cool"", singing in a self-obsessed whine about diamonds on his toes while Riley faithfully recreates the original's Princely synths. And then there's the utterly inexplicable country-fried ""My Medicine"", which Snoop dedicates to ""my main man Johnny Cash, a real American gangster"" before intoning ""Grand Ole Opry, here we come"" and sing-rapping about weed over Everlast's respectable Tennessee Three pastiche. It's the closest thing we've ever had to a straight-up country song from one of the world's most recognizable rappers, and it's also a celebration of drugs dedicated to a beloved figure whose pill habit almost killed him more than once; I sort of can't believe it exists. As batshit awesome as ""My Medicine"" is, the best two moments of Ego Trippin' are its two last songs, ""Why Did You Leave Me"" and ""Can't Say Goodbye"", both wide-open heartbroken emo-pop-soul lilts on which Snoop sounds more like an actual human being rather than a walking catchphrase dispenser. The first is a generous, bedraggled breakup track with an absurdly catchy beat from Hitboy and Polow da Don; three months from now, it'll probably be inescapable. And on the second, Snoop and the Gap Band's Charlie Wilson moan empathy for the people who share their backgrounds over a gorgeously elegiac Riley track. These are some grown-up songs, and Snoop probably has a whole album of them somewhere in him. But as long as the pothead-pimp shtick keeps selling, we'll probably never hear it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11277-ego-trippin/,Geffen,2008.0
333,Sia,Some People Have Real Problems,Pop/R&B,4.8,February 27 2008,Liz Colville,,"Each of Sia Furler's albums has been released on a different label, but it should come as no surprise that her fourth, and most promising, comes on Starbucks' label Hear Music. (It also should be no surprise that Hear Music has helped make this her most commercially successful record.) The Adelaide-born English crossover, who has worked with Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, and Zero 7, has been a likeable, clean-voiced accessory for years, but she got her first (independent) big break when ""Breathe Me"", off 2004's Color the Small One, was featured in the final episode of Six Feet Under and caused a minor that. Some People Have Real Problems tries to be something else: brazen yet fun, sophisticated yet goofy. Composed in large part by Sia in conjunction with her supporting instrumentalists, the songs are full of bounce, springtime, and California cool. And Beck is featured on two tracks, ""Academia"" and ""Death By Chocolate"". But it doesn't help. From the start, Problems nods to both Sia's résumé and to her neighbors on the latté bar: Feist's playful, smokey ballads and Zero 7's drum-and-bass slugs. ""Little Black Sandals"" screams failure just by mentioning a pair of shoes in its title (see: Katherine McPhee) and the R&B reaches are dreadful. ""Lentil"" is brave and explorative by rhythm and melody, inserting a pinch of Regina Spektor-via-Tori Amos into the mix. Still, the chorus is too bland and the rhythm too slow. This andante dullness is prevalent on the album, as if Norah Jones were going about stealing Feist's audience. has potential, but where this song could actually use the heat and the punch of percussion, there is none. ""The Girl You Lost to Cocaine"" is stellar, but like Esthero before her, Sia so often concedes to choruses that are rote and thin on the ground, packed full of airy, electrified harmonies. I want soars, climbs, and surprising bridges; instead there are puffed up harmonies and a tad of decoration from the brass and keys. The anticipation of the chorus is enough to play the song on repeat for a couple of days, but the chorus is still there, irritatingly memorable, and, in fact, it seeps into every part of the song, dominating the subtle inventions of melody and Sia's clear talent for deft hops around the scale. ""Electric Bird"" is a winner, though it, too, has stock elements in its alternatively languorous and rushed lyrics, pumps from the brass, and tricky shifts into minor key. ""Playground""'s all click-clacking and hand-clapping and more overused vocal multi-tracking. I'd venture to say Sia has not penned a single song without this feature. The perfect balance-- and the potential that few of the tracks reach-- is uncovered on ""Soon We'll Be Found"", which is sexy and balladic, yet dark and raging. It's surprising, colorful, and complex. But there are too many attempts at this type of song, and not enough of the springtime fun suggested on the ridiculous cover. If Sia spent more time at the piano, and/or hired Robyn to write her a couple of tracks, the results could be marvelous. But as it stands, Sia is not aware of her potential-- or rather, her options.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11158-some-people-have-real-problems/,Hear Music,2008.0
334,Johnny Cash,"The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show, 1969-1971",Folk/Country,7.5,February 19 2008,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"Between 1969 and 1971, Johnny Cash spent his Saturday nights hosting a variety show for ABC. ""The Johnny Cash Show"" was shuffled in as a summer replacement for another song-and-skit show, ""The Hollywood Palace"", and featured Cash and his touring company: His wife June Carter, various members of the Carter Family, Carl Perkins, the Tennessee Three, the Statler Brothers, and a series of rotating guest stars (beginning, rather auspiciously, with the camera-loving Bob Dylan). Each of its 58 episodes were shot before a live audience in Nashville's legendary Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry. It was the first network television show ever produced out of Nashville. At the time, Cash was hitting his popular and personal apex: At Folsom Prison had enjoyed a remarkable 92-week run on the pop charts, a Grammy (Best Male Country Vocal) gleamed on his mantle, he was newly married, he was sober and devout. Johnny Cash was a rehabilitated outlaw, a Christian, a husband, a real, earnest American. And for home viewers in 1969, Cash was a welcome antidote to flag-draped coffins. A 2xDVD best-of featuring 66 of the show's musical performances was released in September; the punctuated CD version features 16 songs, including nine that didn't make the cut for the DVDs. The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show is a remarkable collection, featuring live performances by Cash's country peers (Waylon Jennings, Bobby Bare, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Kris Kristofferson) and, perhaps more compellingly, tracks from folk, pop, and rock superstars (Ray Charles, Joni Mitchell, Roy Orbison, Derek and the Dominoes). The CD's production is impressively fluid, given the source material (8-track reels operating at half-capacity, recorded from scattershot stage mics), and was lovingly remixed and remastered after the tapes were pulled from Cash's personal vault. Some of the best bits include the pre-song banter-- before Waylon Jennings performs ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"", the former roommates rib each other gently: ""He was my cook,"" Jennings explains. ""Can you imagine Johnny Cash in a black suit with baking powder all the way down and gravy in the hair?"" ""I was a good cook,"" Cash retorts. ""You couldn't do nothing."" Ray Charles' rich, sultry rendition of ""Ring of Fire"" is stunning, riddled with organ, piano, and brash horns; Charles' transforms the song from an obtuse acoustic tale into high drama. Joni Mitchell duets with Cash on ""Girl From the North Country"" (ironically, the same song Dylan performed for the show's opening night), while Cash and Lynn Anderson kick out a sprightly version of Geoff Mack's ""I've Been Everywhere"". Still, Cash's rendition of Carl Perkins' ""Daddy Sang Bass"" is the record's highlight. The track, which, occasionally dips into the Carter Family's legendary ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken?"", works as a parable for the entire two-season run of ""The Johnny Cash Show"", with Cash intoning: ""We'd get together in a family circle, singing loud/ Daddy sang bass, Momma sang tenor/ And me and little brother would join right in there/ Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul."" Although anyone who's checked out the DVDs will find themselves maniacally restructuring the track list (it's not hard to assume that the label wanted a hook to get fans to buy both documents, padding the CD with a handful of second-tier, if still outstanding, cuts), The Best of the Johnny Cash Show is still a tough testament to the grand fluidity of American music. Cash acted as a perfect conduit for cross-genre pollination, and the class, race, gender, and regional divisions that plagued America in the late 1960s are rendered perfectly irrelevant here.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11191-the-best-of-the-johnny-cash-tv-show-1969-1971/,"Columbia,Legacy",2008.0
335,Michael Jackson,Thriller: 25th Anniversary Edition,Pop/R&B,7.2,February 15 2008,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"Thriller is the biggest-selling album of all time; it says so on the cover of this reissue package. What it doesn’t say is that, on a worldwide scale, it outpaces the Eagles, Pink Floyd, and Celine Dion by more than just a marginal million or so: At 100 million+ copies sold, it’s estimated to have sold more than twice its nearest rival. And so people try to concoct explanations. The album was focus-grouped for broader appeal—but then why haven’t focus groups worked so well since? Jackson made the racial crossover breakthrough on MTV—but once that door was opened, why didn’t the sales crossover work for others? Jackson’s stunning dancing and videos exploded pop’s visual formatting—but the Thriller album, until DVD-era reissues like this one, wasn’t a visual experience. When Thriller opens, those 100 million sales feel just. “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’” is pure confused, shocked teenage rush. So there’s another theory: Thriller is the best-selling record ever because it’s the best record ever. That one holds up for six minutes and two seconds, during which Jackson and Quincy Jones mix the tension of rock’n’roll with the rapture of disco and hit perfection. But then you get “Baby Be Mine”—one of the original tracks that wasn’t a single—and the momentum fades: On the heels of “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’”, it should maintain the temperature; instead, it goes nowhere, starts nothing. Thriller is inconsistent in style, which gives it something to appeal to everyone, but it’s oddly tough to listen to even the great bits sequentially—its peaks are from different mountain ranges. “Thriller”’s joke-shop horror segues well into Eddie Van Halen’s headbanging guitar on “Beat It.” But to follow that into the paranoid celebrity funk of “Billie Jean,” the meltingly tender “Human Nature,” and the smooth R&B of “P.Y.T.”? These are all brilliant singles, though; Thriller’s greatness lies in its great songs not in it “working like an album.” For this edition Jackson called in some current big guns to provide remixes, and sadly they do provide the consistency the originals gloriously lack. Will.i.am sets the tone: He takes Macca off “The Girl Is Mine” but decides it can’t work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself. There’s a general reluctance to use what these guest stars are good at: will.I.am is a consistently slick, inventive pop producer but nobody wants to hear him rap, whereas on Kanye West’s “Billie Jean” a guest verse might have added dynamics to the mix’s clumsy claustrophobia. Fergie’s gift as a pop star is the way her crassness shifts into oddness—so on “Beat It” her nervous reverence is a waste of time. Only Akon comes off well, flipping the meaning of “startin’ somethin’” and turning the song into a joyful seducer’s groove, and here it’s Jackson’s own mush-mouthed new vocal that spoils things. The remixes aren’t a missed opportunity—they’re an imaginative way to wring bonus material from sessions overseen by a notorious perfectionist. It could be a lot worse. The last time Thriller got reissued it included “Someone in the Dark,” a horror from the E.T. soundtrack showcasing Jackson’s most saccharine side. We’re spared that, and the token MJ rarity here is “For All Time,” recorded during the Thriller sessions (and then later rejected for Dangerous). A glistening, slightly overdressed piano ballad, it might have made a nicely sappy album closer—if we didn’t already have the subtler, understated, and underrated “The Lady in My Life,” possibly Jackson’s most soulful solo performance on the record. The DVD footage, with all the videos you’d expect, is much better. Watching the famous Motown 25th Anniversary performance of “Billie Jean” in particular I’m struck by how angular Jackson’s dancing is, how tense: Knees and elbows spiking out, body freezing into indecipherable alphabets. And then how beautiful, the way he simply flows out of each position, the release that made his music so joyful given kinetic form. The biggest-selling album of all time, then, and you should probably take the “of all time” literally. His highest-clout guest stars here have shifted around one-twentieth the copies Thriller has, and in a dwindling industry it’s hard to imagine anything similar happening again. Fluke it maybe was, but as a unification move it worked—the last time, maybe, one person could incarnate almost all of pop, all the corny and all the awesome in one mind. We live now in the world of the “long tail”—Thriller was the big head.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11163-thriller-25th-anniversary-edition/,Epic,2008.0
336,Lil Wayne,The Leak EP,Rap,7.7,January 17 2008,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Lil Wayne is a tease. Even though he's spent the past couple of years flooding the market with mixtapes, he hasn't released a proper solo album since Tha Carter 2 in 2005. Tha Carter 3, his long-awaited follow-up, should've arrived months ago, but Wayne keeps pushing it back. He says he's keeping demand up by making us wait, while message-board gadflies speculate that he just isn't cut out to make a classic full-length album. Late in 2007, he said that he'd end the year with a compilation album called The Leak, clearing away all the best tracks that have trickled past the lax security at Cash Money's offices in preparation for the real thing. But The Leak never came; instead, we got a new solo album from Birdman, Wayne's shitty half-rapping father figure. And then, on Christmas, a new Lil Wayne EP hit online stores like iTunes and Amazon with zero fanfare, without even Wayne's face on the cover. The Leak EP is a meager offering: five songs, ranging in quality from absolute bangers to intriguing sketches, which tell us little about how The Carter 3 might eventually sound. One of the common critical complaints against Wayne is that he can rap but that he doesn't know how to make songs. His weeded-out free-associative signature doesn't need to conform to old ideas about song structure to do its work; on last year's double-mixtape bonanza Da Drought 3, he mostly just followed his muse over every half-decent recent beat he could find, letting the overblown boasts and batshit similes flow freely. He'd sacrifice none of his demonic magnetism if he just kept rapping at that level forever. But by the end of the year, he appeared to be losing steam; on the November mixtape The Drought Is Over, he busied himself playing around obnoxiously with T-Pain's autotuner effects, and the actual rapping was, by Wayne's high standards, exhausted and uninspired. So it's oddly reassuring to hear Wayne deign to finish a few actual songs, complete with verses and choruses and intros and everything. And even if every song on The Leak finds Wayne sticking to his usual talking points, finding even more clever and circuitous ways to let us know how fly he is, his voice has more urgency and determination than he's shown in recent months. And even at his laziest, he's still riveting. But first the great. Opener ""I'm Me"" starts with tinkling ominous piano and stray vocal samples from past Wayne hits (""Go DJ"", ""Fireman""). And when the titanically jittery drums kick in, the string of possessed one-liners that follows puts the song in the same league as those older ones. Some are perfectly succinct and elegantly constructed: ""I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been/ I'm married to that crazy bitch, call me Kevin Federline."" Some are borderline nonsensical: ""I'm a monster, I tell you, monster Wayne/ I have just swallowed the key to the house of pain."" But throughout, there's a strident sense of purpose in his gurgling croak of a voice, like he finally has something at stake. And the third track, ""Gossip"", brings that purpose into focus. The first time anyone heard it was when he did a fiery rendition of it at the BET Hip Hop Awards a few months ago, and it's rumored to be the response to 50 Cent's recent string of underhanded jabs against Wayne. Over the track's huge, epic chopped-up soul and heart-monitor beeps, Wayne sounds genuinely heated: ""Stop analyzing, criticizing/ You should realize what I am and start epitomizing."" The next three tracks never bring back that sense of breathless urgency, but all of them would've made for perfectly acceptable album-tracks on Tha Carter 2. ""Kush"" is a happy, stoned little dip into Wayne's immense supply of weed-based punchlines. ""Love Me or Hate Me"" starts Wayne breathing his nonsense over epic swelling strings, no drums in sight. When it kicks in, he brings a guttural sung chorus that works as a distant cousin to his immortal hook on Playaz Circle's ""Duffle Bag Boy"", but his boasts never cohere into anything concrete. And on ""Talkin' About It"", he brings an evilly assured singsong flow over a heavy organic bounce track. But those last three tracks are just practice. Or maybe they're victory laps after the apocalyptic openers. Either way, The Leak is an encouraging sign that Wayne's managed to keep himself sharp even after all the material he's already churned out in recent months. Now it's time for him to make good on its promise.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11042-the-leak-ep/,"Interscope,Cash Money",2007.0
337,James Brown,"The Singles, Volume Four: 1966-1967",Rock,8.4,January 2 2008,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"As 1966 began, James Brown had finally started to find the mode that would sustain the peak of his career; by the September 1967 session that concludes this volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only series collecting all of his singles, he'd definitely reached it. The pivotal moment comes right near the end of the compilation, with the June 67 single ""Cold Sweat"", a song that made every other soul musician in the world break out in one. (Jerry Wexler is quoted in the liner notes: ""No one could get a handle on what to do next."") On ""Cold Sweat"", Brown traded concrete song form for a selection of rhythmic hooks, unresolved chords, and two-note gestures; he cut loose drummer Clyde Stubblefield to play a solo breakbeat at a time when nobody even knew what a breakbeat was; he called for Maceo Parker's saxophone solo as if spontaneously directing his band on stage rather than recording in a studio. It was the most commanding groove anybody had ever heard, and it made everything else on the radio sound stale and starched by comparison. And then he did it again, a couple of months later, with ""Get It Together"". Some of the second half of Volume Four boils down to development and research for the breakthrough of ""Cold Sweat"", especially the jacked-up rhythms of ""Bring It Up"" and ""Let Yourself Go"" and the previously unreleased instrumental two-parter ""It's a Gas"" (originally credited to ""The James Brown Dancers""). But what's notable is how much of the two-disc set isn't, and how much of it is first-rate. (Note: ""first-rate"" is about three rates away from his organ solos, which this time are inflicted on instrumental covers of Ray Charles and Martha & the Vandellas hits. They can't all be winners.) For most of 1966, Brown was working a kind of swinging big-band-via-R&B vibe-- the boogaloo beat he documented in ""Ain't That a Groove"" and its instrumental cousin ""New Breed"", as well as the slightly more programmatic but equally delightful ""Money Won't Change You"" and ""Don't Be a Drop-Out"". He scored another ballad hit with ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"", which replaced ""Lost Someone"" as the emotional core of his live show for the next 40 years, but he didn't bother going back to that mode for a while on his singles (aside from a peculiar, three-year-old cover of George Gershwin's ""I Loves You Porgy"" that dodged the charts altogether in 67); he revisited Wynonie Harris' ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" and Wilbert Harrison's ""Kansas City"", and re-upgraded his previous upgrade of the ""5"" Royales' ""Think"" as a duet with Vicki Anderson. And he knocked out three Christmas singles in 66, one of which implies that nobody dared to suggest he might want to edit a hook and title that goes ""Let's Make Christmas Mean Something This Year"", and one of which is a brilliant demonstration of his craft: on one side, he croons ""The Christmas Song"" in a solid imitation of polite, Charles Brown-style R&B; on the other, he uses basically the same arrangement, but cuts loose on it, James Brown-style, slurring, howling and rewriting its melody on the fly. There's only one taste on Volume Four of the fury of Brown's live shows, and it's very short-- just over 100 seconds-- but astonishing. ""Tell Me That You Love Me"", the B-side of ""Don't Be a Drop-Out"", is a razor-wire tangle of shrieks and tape loops, a single verse that breaks down into a wall-shattering series of screams, then repeats the whole process. The liner notes tell the story: It's a few fragments of tape salvaged from a scrapped live album's rewrite of Junior Walker's ""Shotgun"", and bludgeoned into something like a releasable recording by production manager Bud Hobgood. There's never been another record like it, and by the time it came out, James Brown was moving so fast that he'd already forgotten about it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10929-the-singles-volume-four-1966-1967/,Hip-O Select,2007.0
338,Radiohead,In Rainbows [CD 2],Rock,6.2,December 14 2007,Chris Dahlen,,"The ""pay what you want"" fire sale that launched In Rainbows in October wasn't a new idea so much as a perfect amalgamation of distribution tactics that bands large (Smashing Pumpkins) and small (the thousands on MySpace) have tried since the birth of the mp3. As technorati, Radiohead are to indie bands what Led Zeppelin were to broke old bluesmen: They took the ideas and got people to scream about them. Three months later, the questions keep flying about their business: How many people bought the download? What was the average sum they chucked in the tip jar? Is it true that, even though Radiohead basically gave the files away, a slim majority of listeners went ahead and stole them out of habit? It's fair to say that the shop talk eclipses interest in the B-sides record tucked into Radiohead's $80 discbox (which it packs in alongside In Rainbows on both CD and vinyl, plus pix, artwork, lyrics-- and if you have to ask if that's all worth the price, it's clearly not meant for you). Like the main LP, this bonus disc could not be mistaken for the work of a band other than Radiohead-- from Thom Yorke's nerve's-edge balladeering, to ever-slighter splashes of experimentalism, to guitar tones as fussed over as other band's hairdos. But it also catches the band at its most maudlin: Not only did Radiohead cram their leftovers onto this bonus disc, but they also gather all the mopey, overplayed tropes their last album left behind. Radiohead have always capitalized on tension, but here, that tension turns to exhaustion. The playlist wades from one slice of paranoia to another, the ear going most often to the incessant horror film piano-- and to Yorke's voice. His strained falsetto and near-soul-singing on ""Down Is the New Up"" deliver the risk-taking you'd expect from an odds-and-ends release, but the cynical/alienated rut into which he grinds himself has the persistence of a toothache. ""Up on the Ladder"", which has been under construction since the 1990s, is all climb, no teeter-- and elsewhere bare lines like ""I can't face the evening straight/ And you can offer me escape"" sound like the guy at the next bar stool that you've been turning your back to all night. Here, Yorke sounds like neither a post-millennial prophet nor an uncanny empathist, so much as a crank. Still, the thick fog that hangs over the album doesn't obscure all its gems. Though it goes nowhere, ""Go Slowly""'s slow burn would have fit on the proper album-- for that matter, it could've been an outtake from any of their last four records. The pristine ""Last Flowers"" may be a textbook Yorke ballad, but at least it's a pretty one. As the album's only wake-up call, ""Bangers & Mash""'s antic drums grab your attention until Yorke's crude snarling lets it go again-- although the itchy, uncomfortable feeling it gives you is an interesting break from an otherwise sweatless set. Best-of-EP honors go to ""Four Minute Warning"", a breath-catching little campfire song about (what else?) taking cover from an aerial attack: Radiohead have predicted World War III for so long, it's no surprise they'd stay calm when it shows up. But its weaknesses notwithstanding, this bonus disc isn't meant for the public at large; it's for the fans, who've studied these songs through bootlegs, YouTube clips, and clues on websites. To them, it's an extra goodie in the luxurious Discbox stocking. And as net-savvy as Radiohead may be-- and for as many goofy webcasts and sketchy websites as they've posted over the years-- they still seem to love their hard, physical packages. These aren't just the studio versions of ""Up on the Ladder"", et al.: They're the canonical, compact disc editions, polished and packaged as official versions. A lesser band might have crammed some bootlegs and demo takes in here, but when Radiohead put something on disc, they want it to count. For a band with so many ideas about digital life, they still treat the record as king.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10988-in-rainbows-cd-2/,Self-released,2007.0
339,Wu-Tang Clan,8 Diagrams,Rap,8.0,December 11 2007,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"The general consensus seems to be that RZA has lost his fucking mind. Rap critics, bloggers, and comment-box choirs haven't taken to his strange new mutation-- and that would be a problem even without fellow Clan members Raekwon and Ghostface lashing out at him. Rae complained in an interview with Miss Info that the production on 8 Diagrams ""is not the vibe I want,"" saying RZA was turning into some sort of ""hip-hop hippie."" Ghost has been down on RZA, too, quoted in The Village Voice as saying the producer's ""fumbling the ball...his music wasn't sounding like how it was when we first came in."" And then there's the small matter of Ghostface's decision to release his latest solo album, The Big Doe Rehab, on the same day as 8 Diagrams. The Wu agreed to push their album back a week, but that hasn't stopped fans and critics from pitting the two records against each other in a polarizing boom-bap vs. psychedelia showdown. It gives you a clearer idea of why Wu-Tang hasn't released a record in six years: When a couple of MCs have worked together under the same creative catalyst this long, it's hard to get them all to move in the same new direction at the same pace-- let alone nine of them. Or eight. The death of Ol' Dirty Bastard signified the end of the classic Wu-Tang Clan lineup, even without the internal strife that almost assuredly guarantees we won't be seeing a follow-up to 8 Diagrams anytime soon. Russell Jones' passing isn't the only reason so much of this record sounds the way it does, but it had to have started some kind of domino effect that compounded all of RZA's brooding, spaced-out, and detached tendencies. Nothing here will go down well in the clubs or on the radio. Even the bangers sound melancholy or apprehensive, evoking darting eyes more than bobbing heads. After waiting so long, it's understandable that fans wouldn't want a record like this, where the bleak moments outweigh the triumphant ones. Of course, in due time-- maybe it'll take years-- 8 Diagrams will sink in as a compelling, well-regarded album. And if this really is the end, it'll be the ideal last chapter and a smart bookend to Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The production moves that stick out like nails on a chalkboard to rap traditionalists-- the acid-funk guitars, the melodic r&b hooks, the live instrumentation-- aren't nearly as off the hinges as some of rap's weirder recent detours (this isn't the Wu's The Love Below). Instead, they push the boundaries of what RZA's traditionally done without breaking too far out of character. ""Take It Back"" finds RZA revisiting previous work, snatching the same hunk of Bob James' ""Nautilus"" he once turned into Ghostface's ""Daytona 500"", but reduces it to a measured, weaving series of sharp jabs. ""Rushing Elephants"" and ""Wolves"" refine his cleaned up soundtrack-influenced style (circa The W), drawing from Morricone-esque touches (heist-film suspense horns, eerie Western whistles, ghostly choirs) and putting some workmanlike but effective breaks beneath to keep the pulse heavy. And the way he assembles tracks still impresses, whether piling on thin sample layers (a guitar from Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang""; the drum machine taps from There's a Riot Goin' On) in ""Windmill"" until they sound fully fleshed-out, or pulling out surprise changes mid-way through a track: ""Campfire"" cuts under the last couple of lines in Ghostface's verse for a brief dub-echo interlude, and the otherwise understated symphonic soul of ""Gun Will Go"" shifts during Masta Killa's verse to something that sounds like the horn riff to Baby Huey's ""Listen to Me"" played through an old-timey Victrola at 3/4 speed. The more experimental tracks show how comfortable RZA's become with bucking conventional wisdom. Prototypical message statement ""Unpredictable"" piles switchblade strings onto muffled wah-wahs and screaming guitars that sound like Maggot Brain-era Funkadelic scoring a blaxploitation Psycho. (The hook: ""Wu-Tang is unpredictable."" No shit!) ""Stick Me for My Riches"" has some crossover appeal-- skittering digital hi-hats, bombastic horns, r&b vocals-- but give RZA credit for the risky move of bypassing radio-friendly Akon/T-Pain/Ne-Yo-level candidates in favor of a 1970s vet, the Manhattans' Gerald Alston. Even 8 Diagrams' most contentious track, the Beatles-interpolating ""The Heart Gently Weeps"", has precedent, since the Jimmy Ponder soul-jazz cover that acts as its foundation was rhymed over by Ghostface on the circa-Pretty Toney white-label track ""My Guitar"". (Granted, it didn't have John Frusciante noodling over it or Erykah Badu sounding like a 12-year-old on the chorus.) The only time this mad-scientist auteurism comes close to backfiring is the RZA solo showcase ""Sunlight"": Even with the intrusive, beat-derailing martial arts fight scene coda and one of Bobby Digital's more impenetrable metaphors (""I've been highly misunderstood by those who've met us/ They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce""), it's a thoughtful meditation that aims to justify Islam as a source of theological insight at a time when America is least receptive to it. So how do the other MCs ride beats like this? Ghostface makes himself scarce in the record's first half, and disappears completely in the second. He pulls off a few good verses, though, spitting Supreme ClienteleÂ­-level rapidfire free-association (""This is real talk, shank lullabyes/ Ben Franks, we like Jet Blue, we stay hella high"") on ""Take It Back"", and narrating a chaotic grocery store ambush/gunfight/struggle scenario on ""The Heart Gently Weeps"". Meanwhile, his partner in disaffection Raekwon shows up on half the cuts, and despite his accusations, there aren't any moments where RZA's production undercuts his style; in fact, pretty much every line he's got-- from the uptempo swagger anthems like ""Rushing Elephants"" and ""Take It Back"" to the slowly-paced murder story in ""The Heart Gently Weeps""-- is hot to the point where fans could start hoping Cuban Linx II measures up. Method Man opens the album with a sorta-enh verse on ""Campfire"" (dude doesn't sound quite right making ""SexyBack"" references) and then spends the rest of 8 Diagrams recapturing the fire he had on Tical, reasserting himself as the Wu's top shit-talker and sounding cockier and more confident than he has in years. GZA doesn't really kick in much for the record's first half, aside from his sharp and briefly ironic verse (""We criticize producers 'til they joints are right"") on ""Rushing Elephants"", but he's all over the last five tracks, popping up briefly to spit at least four lines' worth of jewels and, more frequently, a full verse that's front-to-back intricate like his chess metaphors on ""Weak Spot"". Inspectah Deck returns to his usual role as the out-of-nowhere scene-stealer (yet another reason ""Take It Back"" will be a future classic: ""Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms/ Don that I am, made 'im bow in the face of God""). Even U-God and Masta Killa, frequently overlooked as lyricists, sound inspired (check ""Wolves"" as Exhibit A). Still, there's not much real unity on this album-- which makes the album-closing ODB tribute ""Life Changes"" that much more affecting. While Ghostface is inexplicably missing, the other seven surviving members each get the chance to give their own brief eulogy for Russell Jones: Meth pours out some vodka before finishing off the bottle himself, Raekwon waxes reflective, Deck blames himself for not stepping in to help Jones with his troubles, GZA, Masta Killa, and U-God describe their grief, and RZA refers back to his verse on ""Tearz"" (""it's always the good ones that have to die"") before reminiscing over ODB's Grammy-crashing and fights with the law. Given how many times this album was pushed back, it wouldn't be out of the question to suspect some quality control issues, but RZA himself said in The Wu-Tang Manual that he tended to gear the overall style of an album based on what time of year it dropped, and 8 Diagrams couldn't have debuted at any time other than winter-- perpetually overcast, dark before the afternoon ends, and freezing your eye water.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10975-8-diagrams/,"SRC,Universal Motown",2007.0
340,Pink Floyd,"Oh, By the Way",Rock,4.0,December 10 2007,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Let's start with the basic facts: Oh, By the Way is a limited-edition 14-album, 16xCD box set containing the entirety of Pink Floyd's studio album discography, immaculately repackaged as miniature LPs with gatefold covers and the original inner sleeves, stickers and posters where applicable. Also included are a special new poster designed by longtime Floyd-affiliated cover art designer Storm Thorgerson commemorating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and a couple of ""Pink Floyd coasters"" which are included as collectors' items and therefore will never see the underside of a drinking glass, ever.  Depending on where you buy it, the whole thing retails for something in the neighborhood of $250-$260-- just over $15 a disc, which is a pretty fair price if you've ever wanted to own every Pink Floyd album ever in novelty faux-vinyl form. It's also one of the most superfluous pieces of collectors'-market eBay-bait I've ever heard of. There is no rarities disc, no concert material (aside from the live half of Ummagumma), no previously unreleased work, no interviews, no DVDs, no 5.1 audio, no historical liner notes and-- most significantly-- no remasters save the one you can already get on the recently-released standalone 40th Anniversary Edition of Piper. Assuming you're like a lot of people and already own the latest, cleanest retail-release pressings of every Pink Floyd record you'd ever want, Oh, By the Way will serve no purpose outside of a fan-pleasing visual novelty; it practically exists to be looked at instead of listened to.  To be fair, at least two-thirds of this box set is worth listening to-- for the umpteenth time, as the case probably is. That 4.0 is a mark against Oh, By the Way's pointless surface-gloss curio status and its unadventurous by-the-books version of canonization rather than an actual judgment of the music tucked inside. If you really need one of those, pretend that 4's an 8; Pink Floyd's first few phases-- the intial decade or so of their career-- still sound rewarding even as the band itself gets further entrenched in the cultural stasis of classic rock's hermetically-sealed nostalgia. As the sole full-length snapshot of the band's Syd Barrett era, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn neatly sums up what made their first incarnation great-- the balance of whimsy and discomfort, displayed in the band's ability to feel at home inhabiting both chart-friendly psych-pop (""Arnold Layne""; ""See Emily Play"") and experimental space-rock sprawl (""Astronomy Domine""; ""Interstellar Overdrive""). The remainder of the records from the 1960s and their first album of the 70s-- A Saucerful of Secrets, Music from the Film 'More', Ummagumma, and Atom Heart Mother-- reveal a band in continuous and restless transition, looking for their footing and a new identity after Barrett's departure. These records are Pink Floyd at their most aimless-- for every indelible moment like the slow creep towards screaming violence in Ummagumma's live version of ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene"" or their bid for Beach Boys teenage-symphony pop in Atom Heart Mother's ""Summer '68"", there's the tedious multi-part suites that toy with experimentalism for its own sake, some good-start-no-finish soundtrack tidbits and that one Ummagumma track where Roger Waters made a bunch of silly animal and/or ranting Scotsman noises and slapped a big unwieldy 16-word title on it. And then there's the blockbuster stuff. With the exception of 1972's soundtrack-fodder footnote Obscured By Clouds, everything here from 1971's Meddle through 1979's The Wall has become so ingrained in the rock consciousness, so frequently dissected and joked about and lumped in with the Eagles and Yes in the textbook entry for Reasons Punk Had to Happen, that it's easy to forget why Pink Floyd got so huge in the 70s. (I'll pause to let you construct your own pot joke.) That they released some of the most slickly-produced and stylistically versatile music of its time-- simultaneously playing to the strengths of psychedelia, prog, and even r&b (ever play ""Echoes"" and Isaac Hayes' ""Walk on By"" back-to-back?)-- probably didn't hurt their commercial prospects, but a significant portion of their work, The Dark Side of the Moon in particular, was wrapped up in Waters' obsessive search for some kind of human empathy, and in the midst of a culture filled with rampant post-hippie ego-tripping and waning optimism that search rang true with a number of adolescents and college students-- and not just the ones of the 70s. Things do get shakier the further we get into the 80s and 90s: The Final Cut is draining if occasionally patience-rewarding, but the David Gilmour-fronted records A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell are cruise-control adult-contempo dross that sand off every edge the band had. Oh, By the Way doesn't do much to make a specific case for Pink Floyd as an artistic entity-- it just drops everything in your lap and asks you to sort through it. But the odds of anybody not having any of this and wanting it all seem kind of slim, something the 10,000-copy run of this set probably anticipated. And with its sights aimed squarely on the diehard fans, putting the semi-complete works of Pink Floyd on the market without any real attempts to add the additional historical context or sonic refining that these fans would likely enjoy is as shameless as the insincere schmoozing of the ""Have a Cigar"" record-biz schmucks the box's title quotes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10968-oh-by-the-way/,EMI,2007.0
341,Bob Marley & the Wailers,Exodus: 30th Anniversary Edition,Global,8.4,December 7 2007,Joshua Klein,,"By the time Bob Marley died-- in 1981, of cancer-- he was one of the world's first global superstars, famous and lauded from Europe through Africa and the Americas. Some even saw him as not just a reggae singer but as a folk hero, a sort of freedom fighter, and to this day his enduring image feels greater than the music he made. Yet it's that music that drives Bob Marley, Inc., which has extended Marley's legacy one step beyond mere icon: In the 21st century, Bob Marley's a bona fide brand, a veritable back-to-school staple every bit as important as more practical dorm-room accoutrements, a mildly rebellious signifier for those not quite ready to wade into the slightly muddier waters of the Che Guevara poster. Marley isn't the best reggae singer Jamaica ever produced, but he's certainly the best-known and best-selling. Indeed, nary a music listener goes a lifetime without picking up Marley's best-of Legend, a disc that stresses the singer's mastery of pop music in general as much as reggae specifically. Ironically, those millions of copies of Legend shipped and sold each year as totem, talisman, or token have obscured Marley's place as an album artist, but the singer's catalog shouldn't be an afterthought. 1977's Exodus-- recorded in London exile after a failed attempt on his life-- turned out to be Marley's biggest-selling studio album. Recently, Time magazine tapped it as the greatest LP of the 20th century. Other Marley discs had bigger hits and still others had better album tracks, but the balance Marley strikes between politics, religion, and romance on Exodus-- compare and contrast the urgent title track and the laid-back ""Jamming""-- shows a pop star at the peak of his powers. For better or worse, it's Marley's mellower side that sets the tone of Exodus. It may have come off nuts at the time, but Robert Christgau's comparison of late era Bob Marley to Steely Dan isn't totally off base. Songs like ""Waiting in Vain"" and ""Turn Your Lights Down Low"" are first and foremost smoooooooth, and if chants like ""The Heathen"" and ""Guiltiness"" hint at a certain call to action, the presentation trumps the message. ""Exodus"" may make you want to rise up and fight on the side of Jah, but the message you take from the album as a whole is the one delivered in ""One Love"" and ""Three Little Birds"": ""Don't worry about a thing/ Cause every little thing gonna be all right,"" goes the latter; ""Let's get together and feel all right,"" Marley says in the former. It was on stage rather than in the studio where Marley's revolutionary powers were at their greatest. He was a charismatic force, and celebratory tales of his fiery performances are legend among those who witnessed them. A previous deluxe edition of Exodus included among its bonus tracks several songs from Marley's famed June 4, 1977 performance at London's Rainbow club in support of the album. This specially packaged set (like a small hardback book, akin to the recent repackaging of Culture's Two Sevens Clash) drops the album-related bonus tracks in favor of a DVD featuring Marley's Rainbow performance in its entirety. The show's been released before, so this edition really offers nothing new, save a reminder that, yes, he was every bit as good as people say. As the performance, the final in a four-night stand (all supposedly recorded at the time for a live album), proceeds, Marley's mantras grow more urgent. His rendition of ""War"" is steeped in conviction, ""No Woman No Cry"" plays like the standard it's since become, ""Get Up, Stand Up"" starts off staid before quickly shifting into high gear, and ""Exodus"" ends the night on an enviable high note. Alas, Marley never made it to America on the Exodus tour. He injured his toe playing soccer and cancelled the U.S. tour, and while he did eventually return to the road, by then the damage had been done: Through a combination of bad luck and religious disdain for medical treatment, that same toe injury led to the spread of cancer throughout his body. Given weeks to live, Marley played his final show in Pittsburgh, of all places, perhaps an ignominious place to end such a storied career but as good a start as any to the places his legacy has stretched since.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10969-exodus-30th-anniversary-edition/,"Interscope,Tuff Gong",2007.0
342,David Bowie,David Bowie Box,Rock,4.6,November 28 2007,Joshua Klein,,"Since the 1990s, David Bowie has been in the worst kind of rut. It's not that his output has been substandard-- each of his recent albums has had its share of pleasures. The problem is that by and large his output has been just good enough. As a result, nearly each of his releases from the past two decades have earned the usual ""best album since..."" reviews, and Bowie did admittedly sound more engaged than he had for most of the 80s (a decade he himself has since mostly written off). But considering that virtually everything Bowie recorded between 1970 and 1980 became more or less canonized, it's a bit of a legacy risk to re-release his most recent slate of CDs as a boxed set, with each album expanded to double-disc sets containing a mostly negligible collection of catalog detritus. It calls attention to the very albums that refurbished Bowie's iconic status, but outside of that big picture context it's a bit of a rocky ride. Following the Tin Machine debacle, Bowie eased back into his own name again. The tentative Black Tie White Noise captured Bowie at perhaps less than the peak of his powers but certainly working hard to regain them, and that's what made Bowie's first bona fide 90s comeback, 1995's Outside, such a bummer. On one hand, it was filled with such familiar collaborators as piano player Mike Garson and Brian Eno, who hadn't worked with Bowie since the famed ""Berlin"" trilogy of Low, Heroes, and Lodger. On the other, the album was borderline unlistenable, marred by an ill-conceived concept and too many indulgent detours. Outside nonetheless contains some of Bowie's most exciting songs, vigorous attempts like ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" and ""Hallo Spaceboy"" to ingratiate himself to a new generation of potential listeners (a strategy extended to a joint tour with Nine Inch Nails). Indeed, Trent Reznor contributes one of the many remixes of ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" now amended to the album, though the Pet Shop Boys' version of ""Hallo Spaceboy"" is not among that song's quartet of remixes represented. The formerly Japan-only ""Get Real"" is unexceptional. A jungle mix of ""I'm Deranged"", on the other hand, telegraphs Bowie's next move. With 1997's Earthling, Bowie made the firm transition from leader to follower, borrowing bits of drum'n'bass to lend his songs some contemporary cred. At the very least, the second disc shows songs such as ""Little Wonder"", ""Seven Years in Tibet"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Telling Lies"", and ""I'm Afraid of Americans"" are remix-friendly, with new best buddies Reznor and Moby handling several of the new editions. But versions of ""Pallas Athena"" (from Black Tie White Noise) and ""V-2 Schneider"", recorded under Bowie's alter ego Tao Jones Index, are still mostly lame. After Earthling Bowie again changed directions, this time resulting in the much mellower Hours.... Sprouting from sessions meant for the forgotten video game Omikron: The Nomad Soul, bits of Hours... found Bowie, the chameleon, looking backwards for once, and the hardcore fans-- i.e., anyone still paying attention-- recognized glimmers of the man's golden era amidst the relative mediocrity. Original versions of ""Thursday's Child"", ""New Angels of Promise"", and ""The Dreamers"", from the video game, crop up on disc two, as well as a couple of fun remixes of ""Seven"" from Beck and versions of Hours... songs that were plopped on movie soundtracks like Stigmata. Perhaps buoyed by the disc's respectable reception, Bowie reunited with producer Tony Visconti (who had worked with Bowie off and on since 1970, and who produced many of his best records) for the well-liked Heathen (2002) and Reality (2003), albums which seemed in part efforts to raze the recent past and return to his arty (and better adored) heyday. The records are steeped both in nostalgia and thoroughly modern post-9/11 paranoid, tough covers of songs from the likes of the Pixies, Neil Young, Jonathan Richman, and George Harrison among their highlights. The extra disc of Heathen features remixes from Moby (again) and Air (who do a good job spacing up ""A Better Future""), but most curiously the bonus platter includes new versions of mid-60s songs ""Baby Loves That Way"" and ""You've Got a Habit of Leaving"", as well as ""Shadow Man"" (written circa Aladdin Sane). The extra disc of Reality now includes a cover of ""Waterloo Sunset"", plus gets a totally pointless new version of ""Rebel Rebel"" and three even more unnecessary remixes of the same. But they're almost worth it to get the wonderfully silly Sigue Sigue Sputnik cover ""Love Missile F1-11"" (which should warm the cockles of Ferris Bueller's Day Off fans). Taken as an uneven whole, the generically titled David Bowie Box serves as an unnecessary reminder that for much of the past 10 years, Bowie seemed to be tossing things out to see what sticks. Yet by the time Bowie toured behind Reality (before open heart surgery halted his comeback) the scattershot gambit appeared to have worked. In the time since, Bowie has recharged his cultural currency, plying elder statesmen to such acolytes as Arcade Fire and TV on the Radio. Both of which, by the way, would be lying through their respectful teeth if they said they ever put on any of the discs in this box for pleasure.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10938-david-bowie-box/,Columbia Legacy,2007.0
343,The Killers,Sawdust,Rock,5.5,November 27 2007,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"They can be taught! What separates the Killers from contemporaries such as the Bravery and Panic! at the Disco-- and what will ensure an audience when those bands have fully fossilized-- is that the Vegas quartet can learn and adapt. While they evolved out of the Strokes' 1970s guitar strut and a flyover approximation of that band's New York-centric sense of style, the Killers have since managed to move up the evolutionary ladder, developing actual tools and displaying the capacity for reason. Sam's Town, their second rung, predicted opposable thumbs and verbal language in the band's future. The band used Springsteen to poke out even more drama from new wave, cross-breeding two very different species-- the Boss' concentrated working-class rock with effete British new wave. Surprise: It sometimes worked. On their way forward, the Killers offer a glance backward with Sawdust, a hodgepodge of everything they've tried in the past as well as a few things they'll no doubt try again in the future. With its vague title and ludicrous artwork, this catch-all gathers outtakes, B-sides, covers, Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke remix of ""Mr. Brightside"", and a dorky hidden track that reveals their debt to Stone Temple Pilots. What the Killers haven't learned is how to dial it back: These songs, just like the albums they were recorded for, are busy with sounds and effects, as if they are aiming to deploy every studio knob or realize all of their harebrained ideas at once. Opener ""Tranquilize"" sounds weighted with stuff-- the typical drum-bass-guitar, of course, but also more guitars, synths both ominous and light, a children's choir, Lou Reed-- all in service to trite lyrics and bombastic melodies. Likewise, their cover of Joy Division's ""Shadowplay"" shoots for epic, losing the minimalist menace of the original in a maelstrom of garishly climactic instrumentation. The Killers' clunky more-is-more aesthetic derives from stadium bands like Depeche Mode, whose music had to sound good in an arena as well as on headphones. But Depeche Mode had the good sense to streamline their songs, making you listen deeply, not broadly. In this sense, Sawdust is musically dense but superficial, with seemingly no grand plan for all those sounds beyond having all those sounds. Songs like ""All the Pretty Faces"" and the too-wry ""Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll"" ramble on long after the band has spent that particular nickel, and even shorter tracks like ""Under the Gun"" and ""Show You How"" never feel concise like three-minute pop songs-- the not-so-bright side of ambition. Even the ""Mr. Brightside"" remix, which breaks the song down just to build it up again, reconstructs with the wrong elements and loses most of what made the original so enjoyable in the first place. On the other hand, boneheaded bombast is what the Killers do best, and they know enough not to grasp for subtlety. Because it's not a proper album and therefore not a big statement, Sawdust may actually be the Killers' loosest collection to date. Whenever listening becomes a trudge, there's a relatively off-the-cuff track like their cover of the Mel Tillis-penned, Kenny Rogers-popularized ""Ruby Don't Take Your Love to Town"". Buried in the back half of the album, it sounds like they recorded in a practice room, with only a few instruments at their disposal. Of course nothing the Killers do is that spontaneous, but nevertheless, they do right by the song, powered by Ronnie Vannucci's rolling beat and Brandon Flowers' slight reimagining of the chorus. Similarly, they downplay Dire Straits' ""Romeo & Juliet"", delivering it like a song instead of a community-theater monologue. Following in Mark Knopfler's footsteps, Flowers refuses to emote, which has wrecked other covers, and the band's understatement is appreciated. Overall, there's a strong sense of exploration on Sawdust; if the Killers don't seem to have much intuitive understanding of balance and songcraft, the overproduction at least suggests a strong musical curiosity underlying their obvious career ambitions. To date, the Killers' greatest accomplishment has been keeping their possibilities wide open, which few acts have managed to do without coming across as timid or aimless. If they can keep that up and actually go to unexpected places, regardless of the results, they'll be walking upright while other groups are still dragging their knuckles.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10937-sawdust/,Island,2007.0
344,Gorillaz,D Sides,"Electronic,Rock",6.0,November 19 2007,Stephen Trouss,,"In 2007, pop renaissance man Damon Albarn continued to work at an almost unrivaled pace, unveiling both his psychogeographic London concept suite/supergroup the Good, the Bad and the Queen and writing and staging his first opera, Monkey: Journey to the West, at the Manchester International Festival. Now as the year draws to a close, almost as an afterthought, he's put together another peculiarly rewarding double album of Gorillaz outtakes, B-sides and, remixes. Gorillaz is the kind of project that used to define adventurous British pop-- a love of African-American music combined with an art school interest in multimedia presentation. These days you could argue that it's precisely Jamie Hewlett's animated mask-- the cartoonface, if you will-- that's given Albarn the license to monkey around with hip-hop in a way to gladden the heart of the Sasha Frere-Jones' of the world. It's provided the necessary distraction from the otherwise overwhelming image of a pasty old white English indie dude deciding to make records with Dan the Automator, Dangermouse, and De La Soul. The first disc of this double album set is evenly split between sketches and absolute gems. ""People"" is an early demo of the irresistably bubblefunk ""Dare"" which demonstrates, by his absence, what a canny idea it was to recruit Shaun Ryder. ""Rockit"" is an amusing one-off, a parodically uninspired slice of cockney geezer electro that might have been knocked out by Ian Dury in an off moment. But tracks like ""We Are Happy Landfill"" and ""Murdoc Is God"" feel like studio doodles that got out of hand. The best songs, ironically, aren't really Gorillaz tunes at all, but seem to have wound up here for want of a better home. ""Hong Kong"", a beautiful late-night urban lament-- filigreed with Chinese zither played by Zeng Zhen-- was an encore and heart-stopping highlight of the Gorillaz stage show, but was originally commissioned by the charity Warchild and feels like an Albarn solo song in all but name. And the same could be said for ""Stop The Dams"", a lovely, moving Icelandic protest song, complete with oddball rant from Einar Ã–rn, once of the Sugarcubes. The second disc consists of some dutiful remixes of ""Dare"" and ""Feel Good Inc"" from the DFA, Soulwax, and Hot Chip, but is notably chiefly for an absolute hash of a remake of ""Kids With Guns"" courtesy of the would-be English street urchin Jamie T. More rewarding by far is the ""Chinese NY"" reimagining of ""Dirty Harry"" in Mandarin. 2007 ends with rumours of a full Blur reunion scotched once more, and reports of a full-length Gorillaz movie in production. You wonder if Albarn is spurred to all this solo and side-project activity by the refusal of Graham Coxon to rejoin the fold, the failure of his original band to properly regroup. If so, ideally the reunion will be infinitely postponed, giving us several more projects with the wit and daffy ingenuity of Gorillaz rather than the prospect of one more conventional careerist rock record.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10922-d-sides/,EMI,2007.0
345,Miles Davis,The Complete On the Corner Sessions,Jazz,9.2,November 15 2007,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Miles Davis dropped jazz for good in late 1971-- not that he'd been keeping up many appearances for the genre in several years. Though his band would still occasionally play old standards live, his main show in the early 70s was free-ish funk, openly indebted to Sly Stone and James Brown (and I still wonder what Davis would have made of Funkadelic). Of course, the maligned genre in question-- jazz-- was mostly the property of people writing about Davis, and in some cases, his still-jazz-oriented peers, so it's no surprise to read his bandmates of the time (percussionist Mtume, bassist Michael Henderson, guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas, drummer Al Foster, saxophonist Dave Liebman) refer back to those days with no small amount of pride, and scorn towards the ever-present ""critics"". The records Davis made during this time sounded raw (but weren't), hard (and were) and not the kind of thing that was going to fit into any particular canon, even as their maker adopted conscious efforts to position his music for younger, blacker audiences. And he might have dropped jazz, but he picked up something a lot more important: the future of music. Since its 72 release, On the Corner (featured in full on the last disc in the box) has attained a level of infamy outmatching any of Davis' other records, though not really for the right reasons. Downbeat's equally infamous calling-out of its tunes as ""repetitious boredom"" unfortunately summed up the feeling of many folks who would have preferred to only remember Davis' music from the 50s and 60s. However, rock and experimental music fans weren't quite so dismissive-- in fact, today, OtC is one of the easiest Davis records to recommend to a non-convert, especially if they're down with the wtf production and uber-grooved-out beats. Teo Macero's editing/splicing/midwifing of the myriad sessions that comprised the record were no less significant to its sound than Davis' pieces, and considering how records are made today, perhaps more so. Still, it's the avant-funk and druggy ambience that lingers longest. There's a reason people compare this stuff to Can. Disc one features unedited takes of ""On the Corner"", ""One and One"", and ""Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X"", all of which would appear in messed-with form on the 1972 LP. And though *OtC'*s edits are a considerable part of its magic, the surprising thing with these tracks is how well they work as just jams (greatly assisted by the fact that in most cases, their signature hooks are intact, such as the hi-hat pulse in ""On the Corner"", or the classic sing-song melody in ""Helen Butte""). ""Jabali"" is a previously unissued track, featuring a slow, lurching bassline from Henderson, and gradually picks up steam while simultaneously becoming more psychedelic (anyone order three extra keyboards?). The second disc begins with ""Ife"" (originally issued on Big Fun), and adds Paul Buckmaster on electric cello. Buckmaster's contribution to Davis' music at that time was considerable, especially via turning the trumpeter onto Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose use of recorded and electric sound had a big impact on the recording of OtC. ""Chieftan"" is a previously unissued, agitated vamp, featuring an insistent hi-hat + rim shot beat, augmented (like many tracks from this era) by tabla and sitar. ""Turnaround"" and ""U-Turnaround"" are also new tracks, but whose slow, heavy grooves would have sounded very at home on, say, Live-Evil or Dark Magus. ""Rated X"" (later on Get Up With It) is just a badass funk track that features some seriously distorted production, and should probably be sampled by all crate-digging, rare-grooves DJs ASAP. Disc three begins with another track from Get Up With It (""Billy Preston""-- not featuring Billy Preston btw), and several unissued tracks: the somewhat raucous, wah-wah guitar-powered ""The Hen"", two HUGE mixes of ""Big Fun/Holly-wuud"" (which would later be severed to make both sides of a 74 single), the skeletal, relatively restrained ""Peace"", and the funk dirge ""Mr. Foster"", which takes the basic groove of ""Big Fun"", and stretches it across 15 minutes of mournful vamping and uncharacteristically solemn solos from Liebman and Davis. Disc four contains the two epic-length tracks from Get Up With It, ""Calypso Frelimo"" and the Duke Ellington tribute, ""He Loved Him Madly"". The first piece begins as reverb-drenched, frantic funk, and moves into molasses-paced death groove (though still laced with reverb, as if recorded in a subway tunnel). I've never been a huge fan of ""He Loved Him Madly"", though its extended (30+ minutes) calm is a welcome respite from the otherwise merciless pace of the rest of the box. ""Maiysha"" (also from Get Up With It) begins disc five, and though its major-key, curiously sprightly guitar figure seems a little out of place with generally darker (or more cynical) music on the other discs, it still retains the exotic flavor of the box's music. ""Mtume"" begins with-- you guessed it-- a conga solo by Davis' permanent conga player Mtume, and soon turns into an up-tempo Afro-Cuban groove with cool triple-guitar wah-ing from Lucas, Cosey and Dominique Gaumont. (A shorter outtake of the same track features a good soprano sax solo from Sonny Fortune.) The 19-minute blues-shuffle ""Hip Skip"" (with a pretty bizarre organ solo by Davis), frantic ""What They Do"" (reminiscent of the faster stuff on Dark Magus) and brief, strangely loungy ""Minnie""-- notable mostly for being recorded at Davis' last session in 1975 before his five-year retirement -- are all previously unissued. The final disc of the box contains all of the OtC LP, in addition to a fairly straight blues on ""Red China Blues"" (from Get Up With It, and featuring the only harmonica solo I can remember hearing on a Davis track), and both sides of the ""Big Fun""/""Holly-wuud"" single. So, here we are again, near the end of another year, with another indispensable Miles Davis box to purchase (which Columbia doubtlessly realizes, as the lofty $120+ price tag might indicate). Do you need it? If you're a die-hard, it's obvious: you do. If you've never heard On the Corner, it's obvious: you don't. However, you do need to buy OtC sooner than yesterday. Perhaps in six months or a year, after you've stopped annoying all your friends by telling them how great it is, then you can go back and order the box-- by which time, should be available for about half of what is now. Davis saw the future with this music. Be smart, do the same.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10901-the-complete-on-the-corner-sessions/,"Columbia,Legacy",2007.0
346,Amy Winehouse,Frank,Pop/R&B,4.9,November 14 2007,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"The self-destructive tortured-artist routine was bullshit when Kurt Cobain did it, it was bullshit when Elliott Smith did it, and it's bullshit now. As anyone who's seen the video of Amy Winehouse desperately finger-fumbling her way through ""Back to Black"" at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards knows, her look-how-messed-I-am public persona is now screwing up her art something fierce. So instead of a new record, Americans are now getting a modified version of Frank, her first album, originally released four years ago and subsequently dissed by the artist herself. Its two weakest links, ""Know You Now"" and a pointless cover of standard ""Moody's Mood for Love"", have been yanked out of the original running order and appended as hidden penalty tracks. Winehouse has a hell of a voice, even when she imitates her favorite jazz vocalists-- especially Billie Holiday-- much too closely. (Just in case anybody misses the idea that she's supposed to be a jazz singer who's somehow stumbled into a neo-soul record, Frank begins with a little fragment of Winehouse scat-singing, and the chorus of ""October Song"" doesn't just namedrop Sarah Vaughan but lifts its melody from ""Lullaby of Birdland"".) None of her songs here are as indelible as ""Rehab"" or as cutting as ""You Know I'm No Good""-- and the best are co-written with Nas and Fugees collaborator Salaam Remi-- but you can hear the development of the high-powered songwriter she turned into on Back to Black in the snarky character sketch ""F*** Me Pumps"" and in the way the sharp-nailed ballad ""You Sent Me Flying"" breaks into a Soul II Soul beat halfway through. And although she hasn't quite nailed the 1972 vibe of her later record (despite some corny vintage-vinyl sound effects), a couple of her stylistic experiments pay off, especially the high-drama soul loop that underpins ""In My Bed"". But Winehouse's slow public wreck isn't just an unfortunate thing that's happening to someone who happens to be a star, it's part of her act, and has been from the get-go-- which means it makes her audience complicit in it. Her favorite lyrical topic, even on her debut, is loving not wisely but too well; on ""Amy Amy Amy"", she's gently wagging a finger at herself about her fondness for bad-news boys. And her deliberate affectation of Holiday's unmistakable vocal tics can't help but suggest the narrative we're supposed to buy into: ""Great singer, tragically destroyed by her unhappy private life and bad habits, who turned her pain into universal art."" (What are we as her audience supposed to do? Stage an intervention? Well, we can at least think very carefully about what our participation in that narrative means. And who are we to say we wish she'd stop going on about how she doesn't need any help and get some goddamn help already? Not vultures, that's who.) Winehouse is good enough that she was worth paying attention to for her music alone before her drama started ruining it, but in the light of her subsequent career, Frank comes off as the first chapter in the Romantic myth of the poet who feels too deeply and ends up killing herself for her audience's entertainment. And that is some bullshit.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10900-frank/,"Island,Island",2003.0
347,Led Zeppelin,Mothership,Rock,7.0,November 12 2007,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"Led Zeppelin were never much of a singles band: From 1969 on, guitarist Jimmy Page was adamant that the group's LPs not be mucked up with filler, so most of their releases contain only between eight and 10 tracks. Led Zeppelin's legacy so significantly shaped the next four decades of rock'n'roll and heavy metal that to further discount any one of those tracks seemed brash, negligent, or stupid. Twelve years of intense self-editing meant that Led Zeppelin required no best-of. Anyone truly interested in their music was advised to dig through their couch cushions until they came up with enough quarters to invest in one (or all) of the band's albums: It would be worth every penny. Mothership-- a collection of 24 of Led Zeppelin's ""greatest hits,"" remastered and selected by the band's three remaining members (Page, as well as Robert Plant and John Paul Jones)-- might be conceptually flawed, but it's hard to argue against songs as indisputably great as these. Mothership is not the first time Page has participated in the distillation of his own work: In 1990, a decade after John Bonham downed his last shot of vodka, Page curated an eponymous boxset (known, in fan parlance, as Crop Circles) which saw their eight-album discography distilled to four perfect CDs. And in 2002, Atlantic released Early Days and Latter Days: Volumes 1 and 2 (each previously available as a single purchase, in 1999 and 2000, respectively), a Page-condoned collection of 23 tracks which awesomely featured all four members of Led Zeppelin on the cover, dressed in giant American space suits and perched casually in front of an illustrated moonscape. Early Days and Latter Days has a tracklist similar to Mothership (the latter adds ""D'yer Mak'er"", ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""Heartbreaker"", and ""Ramble On"", but loses ""Ten Years Gone"", ""What Is and What Should Never Be"", and ""The Battle of Evermore"") so, clearly, the idea of Led Zeppelin's greatest hits is contentious even for the band itself. Fans will probably argue over Led Zeppelin's selections-- omitting ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" feels unforgivable-- and it seems obvious that Page, Plant, and Jones were striving hard to represent every last phase of their career: Some work from the band's crucial 1969-1975 era is sacrificed for late-career tokens like the comparably-mediocre ""In The Evening"" (itself a curious selection, given the relative popularity of In Through the Out Door's ""Fool in the Rain"", which was the band's last release to make the pop single charts). Still, content-critiquing aside, the remastering on Mothership is no small achievement, and it sounds revelatory on even the shittiest stereos. Check Bonham's pitter-pattering in the verses of ""Ramble On"", or the still-intact fuzz at the top of ""Immigrant Song"", or the tiny percussive ""fwwpts"" on ""D'yer Mak'er"", or the restored outro to ""Over the Hills and Far Away"". Twist your volume knob heavenward and embrace Plant's inescapable geekiness, yelping about Gollum and Mordor; chug booze and air-drum with John Bonham: Led Zeppelin sound as tremendous in 2007 as they did in 1972. Mothership offers no bonus content or previously unreleased material. It serves, mainly, as an introduction for those (presumably out of classic rock radio range) still unfamiliar with the band. Longtime fans will find little of use here, although anyone who spends a couple hours with Mothership will find themselves duly reminded that Led Zeppelin are quite possibly the finest rock band of all time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10890-mothership/,Atlantic,2007.0
348,Nas,Greatest Hits,Rap,6.4,November 12 2007,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Odds are, if you have any interest in Nas, you've already heard some wisecrack about Illmatic rendering a greatest hits collection redundant. That's bullshit; as one of the all-time great albums in rap history, failing to top it isn't so much a letdown as an inevitability, and from 1996 on, Nas' conflicts with commercialism, identity, and realness have provided more compelling moments on wax than the unending-sophomore-slump theory would have you believe. A 59-minute, 14-track collection like the new Greatest Hits doesn't even begin to cover it all. Still, the market gets what the market wants, so here's your gratuitous contract-fulfillment best-of, hampered by label rights, an absence of deep cuts, and the obligatory previously unreleased stuff. Given the fact that anyone with a computer and a reasonably complete Nas discography can make their own personal Greatest Hits-- throw on five tracks from supergroup the Firm if you want, go nuts-- the thing that defines Nas' best-of isn't that nearly all of the tracks on it are just about bulletproof, but that the stuff that's missing is important if not flat-out crucial to defining Nas as an MC. First, there's no ""Halftime"". His 1992 debut single proved he could carry his own track as well as he could carry his guest verses (speaking of which, a great homemade version of Nas' Greatest Hits might kick off with Main Source's ""Live at the Barbeque""). The track also cemented his viciously intelligent, humor-laced style, and features one of Large Professor's greatest beats. Second, the problem with picking tracks from an album like Illmatic is that you'd have to stop somewhere, but while its four tracks represented here-- ""It Ain't Hard to Tell"", ""Life's a Bitch"", ""N.Y. State of Mind"", and ""One Love""-- are classic enough that they'd be difficult to substitute anything else for, leaving out ""The World Is Yours"" is just about unforgivable; it is Nas' greatest hit. (Here's a reminder why: ""I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi 'til I'm charged/ Then writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin/ To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement/ Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with."") ""Hate Me Now"" is the only track included here that was recorded between 1996 and 2001. Even if that period isn't his richest creative stretch it's weird to have it so underrepresented (at least throw in ""Nas Is Like"" or something). And, thanks to label and rights issues, nothing from last year's Hip Hop Is Dead shows up here, even though Columbia jointly financed and promoted it with Def Jam. Then there's the material that defined a huge step in Nas' career in the 2000s-- namely the Jay-Z beef. ""Ether"" is one of those rare 21st century tracks that's become an integral part of rap language, with its title becoming a lower-case way of saying you've completely devastated your opponent in battle. Put that in a three-song succession with God's Son cut ""Last Real Nigga Alive"" as the elaboration/defense and ""Black Republicans"" as the reconciliation, and you've got one of the decade's biggest hip-hop stories represented-- in microcosm, maybe, but at least it'd be acknowledged, even if it risked reopening some old wounds. So what's the motive to buy this? The new track, ""Surviving the Times"", is a perfectly fine how-I-got-here reminiscence that details everything from his apprenticeship under Eric B. & Rakim to MC Serch getting him his first deal with Columbia (""Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter/ Rebel of hip-hop coming through a white rapper""); it's also a penny short of a buck on iTunes. The other newish cut, the Rush Hour 3 soundtrack fodder/Cee-lo showcase ""Less Than an Hour"", sounds like a Gnarls Barkley outtake with Nas on the other side of the ""ft."" Greatest Hits is still a decent appraisal of Nas' artistic shifts and the risks he's taken in the last decade, with a second half that's as compelling as it is stylistically restless-- the money-stacks bombast and unhinged fury of ""Hate Me Now"" into the introspective slow-burn intensity of ""One Mic""; the hardcore shot-busting swagger of ""Made You Look"" into the classicist teach-the-seeds Afrocentrism of ""I Can"". And going strictly by how good every song on this collection is and nothing else, yeah, it's technically an excellent record. But look at the cover, open the case, take out the CD, leaf through the booklet: You don't see Nas' entire face anywhere in the art for Greatest Hits. You see his eyes-- filtered through a repeated transcription of ""If I Ruled the World""'s third verse on the cover, glancing over a skull-print bandana in the tray, peering wearily through his fingers in a photo recycled from the sleeve to the ""Life's a Bitch"" single-- but you never get a complete portrait. Now turn the case over and check the tracklist...",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10896-greatest-hits/,Columbia,2007.0
349,Neko Case,The Virginian,Folk/Country,7.3,November 9 2007,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"It's rare that any artist gets her studio discography reissued all at once, but such is the case with alt-country belter Neko Case. Mint Records is reissuing her debut, The Virginian, which it originally released in 1997; the Vancouver-based label also put out her early records with Maow as well as side projects the Corn Sisters (with Carolyn Mark) and, yes, the New Pornographers. In addition, U.S. label Anti- is reissuing last year's Fox Confessor Brings the Flood, as well as two of her previous albums, 2000's Furnace Room Lullaby and 2002's Blacklisted, both of which were originally released by Bloodshot Records. Of the four albums, only Fox Confessor gets any bonus material-- a sampler disc with one new track and four old ones, which reinforce the retrospective aspect of this set. Neither Anti nor Mint is simply reselling Case's music; instead, in an unintended partnership, they're repackaging her as an established career artist, one whose previous efforts deserve your attention as well as your money. Generally considered the redheaded stepchild of Case's canon, The Virginian is an eclectic collection of original material and covers that hews closely to the alt-country model of the late 90s, with two country-swing numbers that haven't aged particularly well (""Honkytonk Hiccups"" and ""Karoline"") and some sparsely arranged ballads that have (""Jettison"" and the title track). Covering songs by Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb, Case takes vocal cues from Lynn Anderson, Kate Pierson, and all those punk singers she emulated in her previous punk bands. Her rollicking cover of the Everly Brothers' ""Bowling Green"" and her 10-story take on Scott Walker's ""Duchess"" feature some of her highest-flying vocals, the kind so bold and surefooted they sound almost too easy, like anyone can do it. Modest but punchy even ten years later, The Virginian retains much of its feisty charm, but Case's subsequent albums would abandon this joyful musical release for darker matters and lonelier sounds. In this sense, The Virginian is a useful complement to Anti's re-releases, because it shows not only how far Case has come in 10 years, but what was lost and what was gained along the way. Furnace Room Lullaby (which is, incidentally, the only Case album that hasn't been reviewed previously on this site) sounds weightier than its predecessor, each song touched by personal tragedy. ""Whip the Blankets"" and ""Mood to Burn Bridges"" are rare rave-ups that feature the road-tested Her Boyfriends and a fierily defiant Case, but as fast and as fun as these songs are, they're propelled by a peculiar desperation that streams through every song, even the breezy ""No Need to Cry"" and the Tacoma-loyal ""Thrice All American"". This sense of unspecified loss culminates on side one with ""Twist the Knife"", which showcases Case's close dynamic with Her Boyfriends, and on side two with ""South Tacoma Way"", a tearjerker that eloquently evokes the aimlessness that follows deep grief. Case's startlingly soulful performance and the songs' lyrical specificity make Furnace Room Lullaby both a fiercely local album and her most satisyfing collection. If Furnace Room Lullaby sounds inspired by real heartbreak, then Blacklisted considers death as an abstract concept, a nocturnal entity that haunts interstates and plane crashes and demands moody music with few hooks. Dropping Her Boyfriends from the bill, Case wrote almost every track herself-- in fact, the only songs she doesn't get sole credit for are the two covers. This new development is important, as it signals a shift in her music from country-soul numbers with concrete imagery and more-or-less traditional structure to less defined songs with impressionistic lyrics and even bleaker themes. On ""Deep Red Bells"" and ""Lady Pilot"", Case intently fashions new mythologies from the Pacific Northwest soil, a fascinating project that serves these songs well. However, with Calexico (and some of her former Boyfriends) accompanying her with just the right amount of eeriness, Case's songs ramble repetitively or cut off abruptly. Blacklisted is unsettlingly open-ended in a way that demands multiple listens but lacks the pay-off that Furnace Room Lullaby so easily achieves. Despite their notably different approaches to the same source material, Blacklisted and Furnace Room Lullaby seem intrinsically linked, right down to their covers depicting Case as a ravished victim of some unspoken violence (now rendered in digipak form instead of so-yesterday jewel cases). Neither of these reissues contains bonus material of any kind, and although there's a wealth of obscure Case releases from which to draw such enticements (including her home-recorded Canadian Amp EP), there's something reassuring about their austerity. These albums will someday deserve deluxe, deeply researched, multi-disc editions, but for now these reissues preserve the works in their original state, with no inferior tack-ons to diminish the impact of those final notes on those final songs. In this foursome of reissues, only Fox Confessor gets a bonus disc, which has five tracks but only one new song-- ""Behind the House"", which appeared in a different form on Live from Austin, TX earlier this year. Despite its classification as a demo, the song sounds wholly developed even at this reportedly early stage, with a one-two drumbeat and tremolo guitar underscoring her reverb-swathed vocals. ""Behind the House"" is a spiritual sister to ""Deep Red Bells"" and especially ""Star Witness"", a Fox Confessor stand-out whose fatalistic tone and lucid lyrics evoke car-crash death scenes like half-formed memories. There's an intriguing rustic-goth tone to Case's country, a murky twilight mood that draws from the soulfulness of Lullaby and the weirdness of Blacklisted and here is perfectly executed by her backing band, which includes the Sadies and Calexico. The album's sparkliest bauble, however, is Garth Hudson's piano, which curlicues throughout ""Margaret vs. Pauline"" and the rumbling gospel ""John Saw That Number"". Despite Case's fearless performances on ""Dirty Knife"" and ""Maybe Sparrow"", Fox Confessor often pours on the atmospherics too thick, giving it a truncated, unfinished feel too similar to Blacklisted. It is an album with more great moments than great songs, capping the first decade of a career that promises to have many more of both.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11628-the-virginianfurnace-room-lullabyblacklistedfox-confessor-brings-the-flood-bonus-disc-edition/,"Mint,Mint,Bloodshot,Bloodshot,Bloodshot,Bloodshot,Bloodshot,Bloodshot",1997.0
350,Radiohead,In Rainbows,Rock,9.3,October 15 2007,Mark Pytlik,Contributor,"Like many music lovers of a certain age, I have a lot of warm memories tied up with release days. I miss the simple ritual of making time to buy a record. I also miss listening to something special for the first time and imagining, against reason, the rest of the world holed up in their respective bedrooms, having the same experience. Before last Wednesday, I can't remember the last time I had that feeling. I also can't remember the last time I woke up voluntarily at 6 a.m. either, but like hundreds of thousands of other people around the world, there I was, sat at my computer, headphones on, groggy, but awake, and hitting play. Such a return to communal exchange isn't something you'd expect to be orchestrated by a band who's wrung beauty from alienation for more than a decade. But if the past few weeks have taught us anything, it's that Radiohead revel, above all else, in playing against type. It's written in their discography; excluding the conjoined twins that were Kid A and Amnesiac, each of their albums constitutes a heroic effort to debunk those that came before it. Although 2003's Hail to the Thief was overlong and scattershot, it was important insofar as it represented the full band's full-circle digestion and synthesis of the sounds and methods they first toyed with on OK Computer. So, after a decade of progression, where do we go from here? If the 2006 live renditions of their new material were anything to go by, not much further. With few exceptions, the roughly 15 songs introduced during last year's tour gave the impression that after five searching records, Radiohead had grown tired of trying to outrun themselves. Taken as a whole, the guitar-centric compositions offered a portrait of a band who, whether subconsciously or not, looked conciliatory for the first time in its career. Although a wonderful surprise, their early October album announcement only lent further credence to the theory. Where they'd previously had the confidence to precede albums like OK Computer and Kid A with marketing fanfare worthy of a classic-in-making, this sneak attack felt like a canny strategy to prepare fans for an inevitable downshift. The brilliant In Rainbows represents no such thing. Nonetheless, it's a very different kind of Radiohead record. Liberated from their self-imposed pressure to innovate, they sound-- for the first time in ages-- user-friendly; the glacial distance that characterized their previous records melted away by dollops of reverb, strings, and melody. From the inclusion and faithful rendering of longtime fan favorite ""Nude"" to the classic pop string accents on ""Faust Arp"" to the uncharacteristically relaxed ""House of Cards"", Radiohead's sudden willingness to embrace their capacity for uncomplicated beauty might be In Rainbows' most distinguishing quality, and one of the primary reasons it's an improvement on Hail to the Thief. Now that singer Thom Yorke has kickstarted a solo career-- providing a separate venue for the solo electronic material he used to shoehorn onto Radiohead albums-- Radiohead also sound like a full band again. Opener ""15 Step""'s mulched-up drum intro represents the album's only dip into Kid A-style electronics; from the moment Jonny Greenwood's zestful guitar line takes over about 40 seconds in, In Rainbows becomes resolutely a five-man show. (For all of Yorke's lonely experimental pieces, it's easy to forget how remarkably the band play off each other; the rhythm section of Phil Selway and Colin Greenwood are especially incredible, supplying between them for a goldmine of one-off fills, accents, and runs over the course of the record.) A cut-up in the spirit of ""Airbag""-- albeit with a jazzier, more fluid guitar line-- ""15 Step"" gives way to ""Bodysnatchers"", which, like much of In Rainbows, eschews verse/chorus/verse structure in favor of a gradual build. Structured around a sludgy riff, it skronks along noisily until about the two-minute mark, when the band veers left with a sudden acoustic interlude. By now, Radiohead are experts at tearing into the fabric of their own songs for added effect, and In Rainbows is awash in those moments. The band's big-hearted resurrection of ""Nude"" follows. The subject of fervent speculation for more than a decade, its keening melodies and immutable prettiness had left it languishing behind Kid A's front door. Despite seeming ambivalent about the song even after resurrecting it for last year's tour, this album version finds Yorke wrenching as much sweetness out of it as he possibly can, in turn giving us our first indication that he's in generous spirits. Another fan favorite, ""Weird Fishes/Arpeggi"" brandishes new drums behind its drain-circling arpeggios, but sounds every bit as massive in crescendoing as its live renditions suggested it might. ""All I Need"", meanwhile, concludes the album's first side by dressing up what begins as a skeletal rhythm section in cavernous swaths of glockenspiel, synths, pianos, and white noise. With its fingerpicked acoustic guitars and syrupy strings, ""Faust Arp"" begs comparisons to some of the Beatles' sweetest two-minute interludes, while the stunning ""Reckoner"" takes care of any lingering doubt about Radiohead's softer frame of mind: Once a violent rocker worthy of its title, this version finds Yorke's slinky, elongated falsetto backed by frosty, clanging percussion and a meandering guitar line, onto which the band pile a chorus of backing harmonies, pianos, and-- again-- swooping strings. It may not be the most immediate track on the album, but over the course of several listens, it reveals itself to be among the most woozily beautiful things the band has ever recorded. With its lethargic, chipped-at guitar chords, ""House of Cards"" is a slow, R.E.M.-shaped ballad pulled under by waves of reverbed feedback. While it's arguably the one weak link in the album's chain, it provides a perfect lead-in to the spry guitar workout of ""Jigsaw Falling Into Place"". Like ""Bodysnatchers"" and ""Weird Fishes/Arpeggi"" before it, ""Jigsaw"" begins briskly and builds into a breakneck conclusion, this time with Yorke upshifting from low to high register to supply a breathless closing rant. Finally, the closer. Another fan favorite, Yorke's solo versions of ""Videotape"" suggested another ""Pyramid Song"" in the making. Given the spirit of In Rainbows, you'd be forgiven for assuming its studio counterpart might comprise some sort of epic finale, but to the disappointment of fans, it wasn't to be. Instead, we get a circling piano coda and a bassline that seems to promise a climax that never comes. ""This is one for the good days/ And I have it all here on red, blue, green,"" Yorke sings. It's an affecting sentiment that conjures up images of the lead singer, now a father of two, home filming his kids. A rickety drum beat and shuddering percussions work against the melody, trying clumsily to throw it off, but Yorke sings against it: ""You are my center when I spin away/ Out of control on videotape."" As the real life drums give way to a barely distinguishable electronic counterpart, Yorke trails off, his piano gently uncoils, and the song ends with a whimper. The whole thing is an extended metaphor, of course, and, this being Radiohead, it's heavy-handed in its way, but it's also a fitting close to such a human album. In the end, that which we feared came true: In Rainbows represents the sound of Radiohead coming back to earth. Luckily, as it turns out, that's nothing to be afraid of at all.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10785-in-rainbows/,"Self-released,ATO",2007.0
351,Bon Iver,"For Emma, Forever Ago",Rock,8.1,October 4 2007,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"The biographical details behind the creation of an album shouldn't matter when it comes to a listener's enjoyment, but For Emma, Forever Ago, Justin Vernon's debut as Bon Iver, exudes such a strong sense of loneliness and remoteness that you might infer some tragedy behind it. So, to skirt the rumor mill, here are the particulars, as much or as little as they might apply: In 2005, Vernon's former band DeYarmond Edison moved from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to North Carolina. As the band developed and matured in its new home, the members' artistic interests diverged and eventually the group disbanded. While his bandmates formed Megafaun, Vernon-- who had worked with the Rosebuds and Ticonderoga-- returned to Wisconsin, where he sequestered himself in a remote cabin for four snowy months. During that time, he wrote and recorded most of the songs that would eventually become For Emma, Forever Ago. As the second half of its title implies, the album is a ruminative collection of songs full of natural imagery and acoustic strums-- the sound of a man left alone with his memories and a guitar. Bon Iver will likely bear comparisons to Iron & Wine for its quiet folk and hushed intimacy, but in fact, Vernon, adopting a falsetto that is worlds away from his work with DeYarmond Edison, sounds more like TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, not just in his vocal timbre, but in the way his voice grows grainier as it gets louder. Vernon gives a soulful performance full of intuitive swells and fades, his phrasing and pronunciation making his voice as much a purely sonic instrument as his guitar. In the discursive coda of ""Creature Fear"" he whittles the song down to a single repeated syllable-- ""fa."" Rarely does folk-- indie or otherwise-- give so much over to ambience: Quivering guitar strings, mic'ed closely, lend opener ""Flume"" its eerily interiorized sound, which matches his unsettling similes. ""Lump Sum"" begins with a choir of Vernons echoing cavernously, which, along with that rhythmically rushing guitar, initiates the listener into the song's strange space. For Emma isn't a wholly ascetic project, though. A few songs benefit from additional recording and input after Vernon's initial sessions: Christy Smith of Raleigh's Nola adds flute and drums to ""Flume"", and Boston-based musicians John DeHaven and Randy Pingrey add horns to ""For Emma""; surprisingly, their company doesn't break the album's spell of isolation, but rather strengthens it, as if they're only his imaginary friends. Vernon turns the cabin's limitations into assets on ""The Wolves"", layering his falsetto, tweaking his vocal tones to simple yet devastating effect, and piling on clattering percussion to create a calamitous finale. That passage contrasts nicely with the simple intro to the next track, ""Blindsided"", which builds from a single repeating note into a halting chorus melody that sells his skewed Walden imagery: ""I crouch like a crow/ Contrasting the snow/ For the agony, I'd rather know."" Vernon's lyrics are puzzle pieces that combine uneasily; his nouns tend to be concrete, yet the meanings slippery. On ""Flume"", the lines ""I am my mother's only one/ It's enough"" form a strong opener, but the song grows less and less lucid: ""Only love is all maroon/ Lapping lakes like leery loons/ Leaving rope burns-- reddish ruse."" It's as if he's trying to inhabit the in-between spaces separating musical expression and private rumination, exposing his regrets without relinquishing them. His emotional exorcism proves even more intense for being so tentative.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/,"Self-released,Jagjaguwar",2007.0
352,Devendra Banhart,Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon,Folk/Country,6.5,September 21 2007,Marc Masters,Contributor,"In the age of computerized music-listening, calling an album ""too long""-- a dubious complaint even two decades ago, when CDs first made track-skipping simpler-- seems absurdly outdated. After all, it's easy enough to make an iTunes playlist of a record's best songs, right? So I don't get it when people call Devendra Banhart's albums too long. Not only is that problem easy to rectify, but his rambling style needs room to breathe, and space to wander toward its inspirations. Banhart's valleys have rarely diminished his peaks, and often provided ramps to them. But after spending time with the 16-track, 66-minute Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, I'm starting to understand. It's not so much that the quality varies, but that a bloated, lethargic feel permeates the record. Banhart has too much skill and creativity not to hit on something good when given 16 chances to do so. But in the context of the album, even the best pieces sag, bathed in a blurry haze that bleeds over from other songs. And it's hard to shake the feeling that the highlights would've been brighter given the extra time and attention they were deprived of by the lows. The easiest fix would have been for Banhart to restrict his tiresome love of genres. This cloying infatuation pops up on all of his albums, but he usually keeps it to a minimum, and often tweaks the clichÃ©s of the styles he apes. But more than one-third of Smokey consists of indistinct genre exercises. There's a flat Samba piece (""Samba Vexillographica""), a middling Reggae jaunt (""The Other Woman""), a weak Motown rip (""Lover""), and a sub-Santana Spanish rocker (""Carmencita""). Worst of all is ""Shabop Shalom"", a Jewish love song done in doo-wop style and filled with painful couplets (""When I'm ever in a foul mood/ I've gotta see you in your Talmud""). Banhart labors to distinguish these tunes with his stellar voice, but they remain stubbornly forgettable. Only ""Seahorse"", a classic-rock epic that's sort of Banhart's ""Layla"", rises far above mimicry, but even it doesn't make any moves that you can't see coming. Smokey does have a handful of songs that capture Banhart's idiosyncratic mix of odd folk and warbling emotion. For the most part, this happens when he keeps things simple: Opener ""Cristobal"" is a modest tune with a worm-like melody, while ""Tonada Yanomaminista"" is energetic and sharp, practically caffeinated compared to the sluggishness around it. Even better is ""Bad Girl"", whose gentleness is hypnotic rather than sleepy, much the way the slower shuffles on Stephen Malkmus' solo albums find tension in patient strolls. Over small slide guitar and pitter-pat percussion, Banhart's tale of romantic ambivalence is achingly pretty. Similar simplicity bolsters the album's end. The Gordon Lightfoot-esque soft rocker ""Freely"" benefits from a nice Banhart vocal turn, while the wistful piano and voice of ""I Remember"" feels like an update of ""Autumn's Child"" from 2004's Rejoicing in the Hands. Best is the final cut, ""My Dearest Friend."" As Banhart bemoans how he will ""die from loneliness,"" the track does the opposite, gaining strength from its unadorned setting and lack of heavy effects, indulgent flourishes, or winking genre baggage. It's a strong way to close Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, but an even stronger reminder of how much better Banhart can be.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10687-smokey-rolls-down-thunder-canyon/,XL,2007.0
353,Pink Floyd,The Piper at the Gates of Dawn [40th Anniversary Edition],Rock,9.4,September 18 2007,Joshua Klein,,"They say legendry lysergic prophet Timothy Leary used to dose the drinks at parties with LSD, but it might not have been necessary. By the tail end of the 1960s, something was already in the air (and water) marking a radical cultural shift; recreational drugs were just one part of the anti-establishment equation. By 1967, year of the Summer of Love, the counterculture made a valiant bid to supplant the dominant culture, and in retrospect a strong case can be made that the counter-culture won. At the forefront of this battle, in Britain, were acts like Pink Floyd, fixtures of the nascent underground psychedelic scene. Granted, they were fixtures of the infamous UFO Club and the toast of no less than Paul McCartney (allegedly a recent convert to the powers of psychotropic drugs), but the band never claimed to be spokespersons for the revolution. They weren't leaders but fellow travelers-- at least until their epochal debut, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Piper was recorded at Abbey Road at the same time the Beatles were there recording Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but the results couldn't have been more at odds with one another. Where the Beatles exerted complete control over the tools of the studio, Pink Floyd used the studio to lose control. It didn't hurt that the band's primary songwriter and visionary Syd Barrett was on the verge of permanently losing control himself. Less than a year after the release of Piper, in 1967, Barrett was out of the band, one of the most prominent and tragic casualties of the rock era. Of course, while Barrett lived out the remainder of his life as one of the psychedelic age's walking wounded, Pink Floyd went on to much bigger (if not necessarily) better things. Their catalog remains an AOR goldmine, the gift that keeps on giving for the band's principals, who, all said and done, released relatively few records during their heyday, but who have benefited a thousand fold from their efforts. The 40th anniversary edition of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn-- overseen by producer James Guthrie, who engineered and co-produced The Wall and who first cleaned up Piper for its 1994 reissue-- is now available as either a 2xCD or 3xCD set, but don't get your hopes up for a bounty of rarities or other goodies. The former includes both the stereo version of the album as well as the mono version (which many Floyd fanatics find superior). The 3xCD edition includes an extra disc covering the group's classic 1967 singles ""Arnold Layne"" and ""Apples and Oranges"", their respective B-sides ""Candy and a Currant Bun"" and ""Paintbox"", an alternate take of ""Matilda Mother"", two alternate versions of ""Interstellar Overdrive"", and a stereo version of ""Apples and Oranges"". Only ""Matilda Mother"" and one take on ""Interstellar Overdrive"" are previously unreleased. A special edition of Piper was inevitable, but so was the failure of any reissue as incomprehensive as this one: This new edition underscores the reality that EMI and/or the surviving members of Pink Floyd-- especially since they shifted from band to de facto corporation-- have been either downright stingy with their unreleased archives or hopelessly coy about what may lie in there, leaving fans to settle for second-hand scraps like those on A Treeful of Secrets, a 17xCD fan-made rarities compilation. From a fan's perspective, Pink Floyd, Inc. has been either indifferent at best (or hostile at worst) to the notion of managing its legacy-- especially its formative years-- and has only reluctantly taken up caretaking duties as part and parcel of cordoning it off. Few would criticize the merits of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn itself (as reflected in the rating above)-- it's an essential album. While so many other products of the Summer of Love were positive and unifying, Piper was fractured and scary. Songs like ""Astronomy Domine"" and ""Interstellar Overdrive"" captured the sustained improvisational freakouts of the band's live shows, but did so in more concise form. Other songs, like ""Lucifer Sam,"" ""Bike"", and ""The Gnome"", split the difference between quirky pop songs and explorations of the nightmarish found-sound fringe, setting a twisted template for countless acts to come. By 1980's The Wall, Pink Floyd had become sterile and solipsistic. At this auspicious start, Pink Floyd were thrilling. Anything was possible. Those aforementioned singles, ""Arnold Layne"" (produced by early Floyd booster Joe Boyd) and ""See Emily Play"", probably remain the best distillations of early Pink Floyd, and in particular the pop genius of Syd Barrett. They set the stage not only for the more sustained vision of Piper, but also Barrett's all-too-brief subsequent solo output, before he receded into the background. In fact, it's the presence of Barrett (who wrote all but one song on Piper) that accounts for the album's influence as more than just a psychedelic relic. As a lyricist, his stream-of-conscious nonsense verses are every bit the match of Lewis Carroll. As a vocalist, often singing with keyboardist Rick Wright, his languid delivery lends the album a dreamy quality at odds with its menace. You can catch glimpses of Barrett's subconscious in a 12-page reproduction of one of his notebooks, hanging as bait for ardent fans to shell out for the deluxe 3xCD version (selling for around $40), but at least the tactile document is something you can't get anywhere else. That's not the case for the rest of this anniversary set. Even taking into account the remastering, the long-available stereo edition of Piper can now be discounted as little more than a novelty. Yet you can only buy the mono version on its own through iTunes. Double-dipping is one thing; compelling fans to double-dip is another, and the unavailability of the mono version as a stand-alone CD purchase is the kind of move that all but goads downloaders to do exactly what their gut tells them to do. Maybe Pink Floyd can't be bothered to troll through the BBC archives for live material, footage or lost tapes, or bake old masters to their sonic satisfaction, but certainly they can hire someone to do it for them. The appetite is there, which makes such a banal celebration of this psychedelic masterwork so disappointing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10643-the-piper-at-the-gates-of-dawn-40th-anniversary-edition/,"EMI,Capitol",2007.0
354,The Budos Band,The Budos Band II,"Global,Pop/R&B",7.6,September 7 2007,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"The Budos Band's second album, much like their first one, is practically an archeological dig. They've broken down through all the strata of the post-punk/post-disco era to uncover the fertile soil of late 1960s and early 70s Afrofunk and soul-jazz, not to mention funky 70s blaxploitation soundtracks, 60s Now Sound LPs, Ethio-jazz and plain old superbad funk. The end result is something so hip it could kill you in large doses-in the right doses it just plain kills. The Budos crew hails from Brooklyn, but their outlook is definitely global-- they somewhat restrictively term what they do ""Afro-soul,"" which works well as a basic distillation of what they do and probably at least tells the right people to listen. It's strictly instrumental, but never showy, and they avoid protracted compositions-- there are no twenty-minute Fela-inspired burners on here, just a ton of memorable, concise tracks stuffed with compact solos and big themes played by a big horn section. The band's rhythm section is truly fantastic. The bass is right in the pocket, the drums keep everything steady and driving, the judiciously employed hand percussion adds a gritty texture, and the guitar does everything from wah'd-out scratching to playing snaky, surfy leads. Checking over the songwriting credits, I was initially surprised to see Smokey Robinson's name in the credit for ""His Girl"", but listening closely, it is, in fact, based very loosely on ""My Girl"". It's so thoroughly altered that they could have gotten away with calling it an original, especially at this breakneck tempo, but either way, I'd be willing to bet Smokey never imagined his tune being blasted out by a smoking horn section over a chunky Afrobeat groove. The band gets into Mulatu Astatke's Ethio-jazz territory on ""Origin of Man"", which cleverly references Mulatu's homeland of Ethiopia in its title. The dark, deliberate rhythm track is offset by a squealing organ and horns that have just a slight Latin tinge to them. There's not a bad track here, but my favorite might be ""King Cobra"", which opens with a cool, minor-key passage of film-noir guitar and busts into a crazed horror organ solo after the horns say their part. Opener ""Chicago Falcon"" has a wicked groove and excellent horn arrangement that pits legato passages against bursts of staccato. It's like the greatest library track DeWolfe never released in the 70s. This is a supremely entertaining record, perfect for dancing, driving or just providing a soundtrack when you want to nod your head in time to something. The true secret to the Budos Band's success is that they keep it short and to the point. Only a few songs even make it past four minutes, and those are that long because they're able to sustain it. When your whole sound is based on the groove, keeping your listener wanting more is essential, and this does that. While it doesn't really represent a change from their first album, II is proof that the Budos Band's formula is good for a lot of mileage. I know I'll be listening a lot.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10593-the-budos-band-ii/,Daptone,2007.0
355,Sia,Lady Croissant,Pop/R&B,5.2,August 8 2007,Roque Strew,,"Australia's Sia knows a thing or two about instability. Zipping to fame with ""Taken for Granted"", an unlikely Prokofiev nod, and 2002's Healing Is Difficult, she appeared securely on track to pop stardom. But success left as suddenly as it came, driving her to rethink herself and her art. The result was Colour the Small One, a fragile and introspective song cycle inspired, in part, by the loss of an old beau in London to a car accident. When someone at HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" picked one of the album's tracks, ""Breathe Me"", to soundtrack the series' devastating last moments, Sia faced another jolt of celebrity. Judging solely from her latest release, Lady Croissant, which gathers material from a show at New York's Bowery Ballroom, lasting celebrity may not be in the cards. Her fate seems tied to her vocal style, whether her Adelaide drawl is an asset or a liability. The studio work argues for the former, but these live recordings-- especially of Zero 7's ""Destiny"" and ""Distractions""-- build a case for the latter. Innocent nouns like ""mister"" are reborn as ""mizzu-ah-uh-ahh,"" translated into the mystic pidgin dream-language first discovered in Lindsay Lohan's correspondence. The studio version of ""Distraction"" includes the clear, clever plea to ""Make Ms. Me, Mrs. You."" But singing live, as a sort of public execution, Sia hangs, draws, and quarters the poor line. Again and again, the original sultriness is siphoned out. She covers Cher's ""I Go To Sleep,"" written by Ray Davies and famously rendered by the Pretenders. Sia recreates the Pretenders' classy arrangements, but once again, she yanks apart Davies' poetry with her slurred, bathetic pronunciation. Throughout the once-moving ""Blow It All Away"" and ""Don't Bring Me Down"", Sia's delivery seesaws between Rich Boy and Gregorian monks (""I don't wanna chuh-ah-eh-ay-unnnge""), on a continuum that never should have existed. As Sia confessed to an interviewer, this isn't her finest hour. The Bowery Ballroom show offered a starstruck (Michael Moore had pledged to attend), wine-drunk (she was starstruck), and lightly bloodied (an Easter egg hunt went awry, honestly) version of the woman. It just happened to be the one show they recorded. Mercifully, two songs rescue this record from outright catastrophe. ""Pictures"", the single studio track here, was bankrolled by American Eagle, who saw Sia as the next Aryan face of collegiate abandon. The song is deceptively sunny, a great fit for the franchise's philosophy, but better still for Sia, whose strongest ballads wend between against-the-odds joy and an almost gothic fatalism. We get the sense we're hearing the real Sia, properly agonized. In the album's other success, ""Lentil"" sets quiet harmonies behind Sia's shy sing-speak and anguished outpourings. Amazingly, through the fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants, the story's wounded soul shines through. That these two songs are both new, and that these are the two that truly work, is the silver lining here. It's still distressing that Lady Croissant offers only a glimpse of Sia's abundant talent, a faded memory, instead of the widescreen vista fans were waiting for.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10500-lady-croissant/,Astralwerks,2007.0
356,Prince,Planet Earth,"Pop/R&B,Rock",4.8,July 23 2007,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"We always expect too much of Prince, because it's difficult to accept that somebody who made records as astonishing as he did in the 1980s could repeat himself as egregiously as he has for the past 15 years or so. He hasn't been doing r&b-by-numbers or rock-by-numbers, which is why he gets away with it; he's just been doing Prince-by-numbers. And yes, he still brings it live. But his albums used to send everyone scrambling to catch up; now they're self-evidently whatever he deigns to knock out.  Princeophiles always have a few great recent songs we can trot out as evidence he hasn't really lost it. Last time, it was ""Black Sweat""; this time, it's ""Mr. Goodnight"", a sticky-hot seduction rap that all but acknowledges the genre's latter-day debt to Smoove B. He rhymes ""MoÃ«t"" with ""private jet,"" namechecks 3121 (maybe the album, maybe the club), shouts out ""mp3!"" and offers to lay out three dresses (so you can pick the one you like) and call you to find out which you've picked so he can wear a matching suit. Most of Planet Earth, though, is textbook bad Prince. It's one thing to work from the assumption that he's the hottest thing on two legs, because he's never lost that. But when he works from the assumption that his political thoughts are deep and meaningful, he bricks. The title track is an ecological anthem so dopey it makes saving the world sound like a questionable idea; the closer, ""Resolution"", is an antiwar anthem so self-righteous it makes peace sound smug. ""The main problem with war is that nobody ever wins,"" goes the first line, and as above-all-you-mortals as prime-period Prince's politics could get (remember ""Hello""?), at least he never tried to tell us what the main problem with war was. The rest of the album is stuff he's done before and better. ""The One U Wanna C"" is a blatant rewrite of ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man"" (right down to the declaration that ""you ain't no one night stand"") without the emotional depth, subtlety, or musical eccentricities. ""Guitar"", a reminder that he plays guitar, doesn't even have much of a riff. ""Chelsea Rodgers"" is an incoherently moralistic disco jam that squashes its groove between big, dangling quotation marks, as if it came to the West End Records sound by way of an Of Montreal tribute band. Where is the Thinker of Weird Thoughts who gave us ""Raspberry Beret"" and ""Starfish and Coffee""? Well, he's not entirely gone-- that's why we keep listening. There are always flashes of him, as at the end of the pedestrian slow jam ""Future Baby Mama"", where he goes into a purring little recitative, ending ""deep down, I know what you want-- you want your girlfriends to hate you."" Then he harmonizes with himself in one of his thick, layered harmony-clusters: ""'Cause they can't get your man!"" ""Somewhere Here on Earth"" is the kind of bedroom-eyed ballad he used to knock out one-handed in the Parade days, enlivened by his freaky but kind of fantastic Billie Holiday impression, but tragically oversold by witless jazz piano and an overdubbed ""crackly record"" sound. The album's cameo appearances by Wendy & Lisa and Sheila E. are overt signals that this is supposed to be a new manifestation of the prodigal Prince, the one who had all the hits; that he's going to spray us all down with his magical ejaculating guitar, just like the old days. And, you know, he might. He doesn't this time, but he might yet; if this were his first album, it'd be really promising. It's entirely possible that Prince's problem isn't sputtering talent but QC on the fritz. A whack to the right part of the machine, and his next whole album could be as hot as ""Mr. Goodnight"" and ""Black Sweat"" and, I don't know, ""Cinnamon Girl"". As it is, though, he's firmly settled in a stylistic niche that's delivering diminishing returns-- and what made him great in the first place is that he never settled down anywhere for long.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10450-planet-earth/,Sony,2007.0
357,James Brown,"The Singles, Volume Three: 1964-1965",Rock,5.3,July 17 2007,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"As useful as completist reissue projects are, they inevitably run into some stuff that shouldn't have been issued in the first place. James Brown spent the better part of 1964 and 1965 playing chicken with King Records-- trying to get out of his contract, recording for rival label Smash, and continuing to tour on the back of his older hits and the random crap from the vaults that King kept tossing onto the market as singles. This will almost certainly be the weakest volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only complete-JB-singles series, just because its historical context yielded so much barrel-scraping. It also includes three of Brown's biggest hits, including at least one song that pretty much transformed all pop music after it, so that weakness is relative. Still, of the 36 A- and B-sides here, more than half actually predate 1964: Brown didn't hand over any new material to King for the first year and a half of the two years this two-disc set covers. Four tracks are edited, sometimes drastically, from the epochal 1962 gig that became the hit Live at the Apollo LP-- ""Think"" is slowed down almost 20% in order to hit the two-minute mark, an unfortunate antecedent of the chopped-and-screwed sound--and the eight-year-old ""Please, Please, Please"" is (totally unconvincingly) overdubbed with screaming fans to sound live. So is a lackadaisical cover of Louis Jordan's ""Caldonia"" that became Brown's first single on Smash; discovering that it ran only 2:07, Brown apparently decided to make it more radio-worthy by appending a little more crowd noise, then repeating its final 30 seconds. He scored one solid hit on Smash: the double A-side ""Out of Sight"" and ""Maybe the Last Time"", a proto-funk look toward the future and a hard-gospel wave toward the past. (The title of ""Maybe the Last Time"" was fitting: it was the final big single to prominently feature the Famous Flames on backing vocals, even though they weren't credited.) In response, King's boss Syd Nathan sued his star for breach of contract. The legal resolution was that Brown was still under contract to King for vocal recordings, but could record instrumentals for Smash. That gave Brown an excuse to cut a bunch of instrumentals that featured him playing organ with his band. He's legendary for his self-regard, of course, but releasing his organ solos as singles actually crossed the line into vanity. Fortunately, in mid-1965, King and Brown settled their differences, and Soul Brother #1, in turn, finally stopped dicking around. ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", the first fruit of the dÃ©tente, singlehandedly invented funk: it's more space than sound. (It's hard to beat Dave Marsh's description: ""The only way ['Papa'] could be more bone-rattling would be if James Brown himself leaped from your speakers, grabbed you tight by the shoulders and danced you around the room, all the while screaming straight into your face."") He followed that up with ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"", and as hard as it is to hear that song now that it's become the soundtrack to an audio-animatronic James Brown doll, the single grinning tune that stands in for a raging 50-year career, it's still a hell of a record. With that left-right combination, his career pulled out of its two-year mire, and his mightiest decade got underway.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10415-the-singles-volume-three-1964-1965/,Hip-O Select,2007.0
358,David Bowie,Best of Bowie: 1980-1987,Rock,6.0,July 6 2007,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Unlike many of his 70s peers, David Bowie had little trouble adjusting to the 1980s. After all, his career was built upon media-image manipulation entering a decade that, with the advent of MTV, would become obsessed with it. But instead of trying to out-glam the growing legions of synth-pop insurgents copping his old alien/androgyne persona, David Bowie's defining image in this era was to just be David Bowie: a debonair pop idol with pin-up-worthy blond hair, designer suits, movie-star ambitions, and a camera-ready smile that shone brighter than a paparazzi pit. But if the first few years of the 80s saw Bowie score his biggest hits, the latter half found him in danger of losing his relevancy, and faced with the impossibility of sustaining his early, carefully cultivated mystique and vanguard reputation. You can chart this wayward path by his choice of side men: In 1980 his guitarist of choice was Robert Fripp; by 1987 it was Peter Frampton. This third installment of the Best of David Bowie budget-comp series may begin at a year with a nice, round, inaugural number, but with respect to Bowie's discography, 1980 is a somewhat arbitrary entry point. Compared to what followed, the selections from his 1980 signature work Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) feel like the product of another era (not to mention another record company-- it was his last album for RCA before jumping to Virgin). The android funk of ""Fashion"", the Berlin-bound sleaze of ""Scary Monsters"", and the unnerving sing-along ""Up the Hill Backwards"" feel like the closing acts of a Teutonic-soul cycle that began with 1976's Station to Station, while the paranoid ""Ashes to Ashes"" sends the post-hippie/sci-fi idealism of Bowie's glam heyday crashing down to earth. As the ensuing decades have shown, these songs also marked the last time Bowie's pop and avant-garde instincts were so perfectly in sync. Following his triumphant Queen collaboration ""Under Pressure""-- a song so awesome, not even Vanilla Ice could kill it-- the 80s would begin in earnest for Bowie with Let's Dance, whose authoritative title track aptly opens this loosely chronological compilation. For an album so inextricably linked to the year 1983, its MTV-saturated singles hardly bear the musty scent of retro artifacts: On his 2002 Heathen tour, Bowie performed a veritable live mash-up of ""Modern Love"", grafting the song's melody onto the galloping guitar groove of the Strokes' ""Someday"", perhaps as a sly nod to the New York newbies' copying skills, but also to remind us of the song's ageless bounce. Like Bowie's production work on Raw Power 10 years earlier, the Let's Dance redux of his 1977 Iggy Pop co-write ""China Girl"" was a goodwill gesture to boost the earning potential of his down-and-out buddy, but Bowie's more dignified performance has surpassed Iggy's original as the definitive take (although its bare-ass video may have given it an unfair advantage). Amid the hair-raising ""Twist and Shout"" teases of ""Let's Dance"", you almost overlook the uncanny contrast between the song's alluring, horny-funk accents and Bowie's leering, almost dread-ridden delivery. The enduring appeal of Let's Dance is all the more remarkable when placed next to the poorly dated quality of Bowie's remaining 80s output. On previous Best of David Bowie installments, the obvious hits were supplemented by well-curated album tracks, but the paucity of exemplary material from 1984's Tonight (a.k.a. Let's Dance Some More) and 1987's Never Let Me Down don't provide much of an opportunity for reassessment: With its faux-steel-drum refrain and synth-polished easy-rock groove, Tonight's ""Loving the Alien"" is hardly the epic its seven-minute run time suggests, while Never Let Me Down's ""Day-In Day-Out"" captured Bowie in the unfortunate position of playing catch-up to Duran Duran three years too late. Additionally, the compilation is padded with Bowie's middling soundtrack contributions of the era, some of which hold up on the strength of the songwriting (the proto-Pulp soul of ""Absolute Beginners"", for instance), but several of which can't shake off their oh-so-80s accoutrement (the proto-Enigma new-age gothisms of ""This Is Not America"" from The Falcon and the Snowman, or the goofy ersatz gospel of Labyrinth's ""Underground""). But hey, things could be worse-- thanks to this compilation's 1987 cut-off date, we're spared the task of reconsidering Tin Machine.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10274-best-of-bowie-1980-1987/,EMI,2007.0
359,The Clash,The Singles,Rock,9.0,June 8 2007,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"Only an enterprise as fucked as the record business could, or would, consistently wring new material out of permanently defunct outfits-- labels of all sizes continue scrambling for new (and sometimes appalling) ways to re-package, remaster, reissue, re-release, and re-squeeze artist catalogs dry-- and then some. The heartbreaking part is that sometimes all that industry hustle yields devastating results: Last November, Sony released a 19xCD box set of the Clash's 19 U.S.- and UK-charted singles from 1977 to 1985, complete with B-sides, promotional bits, accompanying 12"" mixes, and the Capital Radio EP (which was originally given away with copies of the NME, and previously unavailable commercially, although the Clash fan club did reissue the collection in 1977). With more than 60 tracks (laid onto endearing faux-vinyl compact discs, each with paper liners), the box was a sentimental and aesthetic triumph. But in pragmatic terms, it was also vaguely infuriating: To listen to the entire collection, you'd have to change CDs 19 times, or more likely, waste half an evening loading all the discs onto your computer and constructing your own playlist. Plus, it cost $80. Now, ostensibly on occasion of the band's 30-year anniversary, The Singles box set has been squished onto one reasonably-priced long-playing disc, the 20-track The Singles: Included are all 18 A-sides from the box (no Capital Radio), plus ""Train in Vain"" (the ""secret"" song-- and U.S. hit single-- tucked at the end of 1979's seminal * London Calling*) and ""Groovy Times"", a U.S.-only promo single that was also included on The Cost of Living, a four-song UK EP released in 1979. The Clash wrote loads of political songs, and Joe Strummer's extracurricular sermonizing only inflated the band's finger-wagging rep. But Clash records were never didactic, cold, or patronizing-- The Singles is high proof that the group (unlike other equally-adept, equally-great political songwriters) were actually a killer party band. Try broadcasting The Singles from top to bottom without sneering, pogo-ing, fist-pumping, spitting, high-kicking, shoulder-popping, disco-shimmying, or punching yourself in the thigh at least once. Try not adding in your own background howls; try not screaming ""Thinks it's not kosher!"" out an open window, collapsing onto the couch, then returning to holler, ""This is a public service announcementâ€¦ with guitars!"" Clearly, the triumph here is not so much the assembling of these tracks (these file-swapping times mean scoring rare cuts is less a victory than a banality), but the reminder that, after all the mythologizing and eulogizing, the Clash were a band who released a mess of mind-blowing singles. The songs seem to be organized in order of notoriety (starting with ""London Calling"" and ending with ""White Riot""), and unsurprisingly, it's the oft-forgotten middle songs that sound the best right now. 1980's ""Bankrobber"" is slathered with tin-can echo, so much so that Mick Jones' backing vocals sound as if they're bring transmitted from space. Fold in a handful of weird bass effects, and it starts to sound like the whole thing was written and realized underwater, in zero gravity. The notion that the song is actually about a kid whose dad robs banks because he doesn't feel like getting a real job suddenly seems irrelevant. 1978's ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais"" is equally surreal-- arguably the Clash's first successful experiment with reggae, and written when Strummer was bummed about staying up all night for a crappy reggae showcase (""Midnight to six man/ For the first time from Jamaica/ Dillinger and Leroy Smart/ Delroy Wilson, you cool operator"") at London's Hammersmith Palais, ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais"" manages to indict power-pop, shoddy reggae, and neo-Nazism in one four-minute span. Strummer was openly pissed about the show's Four Tops-style geniality (""but onstage they ain't got no roots-rock rebel""), but ""Palais"" is plenty friendly itself, featuring a classic, singalong pop melody. Likewise, ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Know Your Rights"", and ""Clash City Rockers"" are all timeless, addictive romps. As intellectual as the Clash may have seemed to some, their songs were always more ecstatic than enraged. Ultimately, the Clash endure because they inspire.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10313-the-singles/,Epic,2007.0
360,The Beach Boys,The Warmth of the Sun,Rock,8.6,May 29 2007,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Consider the taxonomy of the Beach Boys compilation. First, you have cheapies like Beach Boys Greatest Hits Vols. 1, 2 and 3, each gathering a dozen or so singles into a succinct package. With such a deep collection of quality hits, the Beach Boys could continue to repackage these in various combinations forever. Various permutations can still be found on cassette in gas stations from coast-to-coast. Then there's Endless Summer, from 1974, the prototype for the expanded compilation that gathers hits but also attempts to position the band as an iconic snapshot of a bygone era. It's hard to convey now how massive that double-LP set was during the remainder of that decade. Widely considered all the Beach Boys anyone ever needed, Endless Summer charted for three straight years and launched the idea of the band as a touring oldies act-- a nostalgic fantasyland you could revisit where Vietnam never happened and baby boomers never had to face the responsibilities of parenthood. Almost everything on the record predated Pet Sounds, before things got heavy and complicated. Even #1 single ""Good Vibrations"", often called the band's (and sometimes pop music's) peak, had to wait for the CD reissue in the 80s to come along for the carefree ride. In 2003, a new set, Sound of Summer, properly updated the ""Only Beach Boys You Ever Need"" comp for the era of the 80-minute CD, and (again) went multi-platinum. The third kind of Beach Boys collection tries to tell the alternate history of the band-- the one that didn't stop making music after Smile fell apart in 1967. This Beach Boys had to contend with an increasingly awkward-sounding bandname, naÃ¯ve politics, a shift in creative energy away from Brian Wilson, and a generally fuzzy notion of what ""The Beach Boys"" as an idea was all about. Most Pitchfork readers are familiar with this period of the band's career-- they're used to debating how Wild Honey stacks up against Sunflower, and trying to figure out which of the mid-70s albums has the most to recommend. But most of this stuff, to many music fans, remains largely off the radar. These are the fans that alternative-history Beach Boys comps mean to bring into the fold. Good Vibrations, from 1975, Ten Years of Harmony (1981), and Sunshine Dream (1982) were the first of these alternative histories, each offering a look at the ""Pet Sounds and after"" Beach Boys from a slightly different angle. The new compilation The Warmth of the Sun takes a similar approach and applies it to the Beach Boys' entire career. So along with a generous helping of the post-Smile material (nothing from Pet Sounds or Smiley Smile is here), there's also a sampling of minor earlier hits. There's even one 80s curio: a truly awful version of ""California Dreamin'"" cut for inclusion on Made in U.S.A., the 1986 half-old-faves/half-deep-cuts compilation notable for including four tracks from the then out-of-print (!) Pet Sounds. ""California Dreamin'"" is the highest-charting single here, hitting #8-- on the Adult Contemporary chart, that is. On the Pop charts, like almost all of these 28 songs, it didn't crack the Top 40. Warmth of the Sun isn't chronologically sequenced; instead, songs seem to be grouped together in a rough thematic configuration. ""All Summer Long"" is an excellent opening thesis, but then the comp detours with four kitschy throwbacks in a row-- two about surfing (""Catch a Wave"" and ""Hawaii"") and two about cars (""Little Honda"" and ""409""). The chorus of ""Little Honda"" is still something to behold, the way the backup vocals chug along like pistons while Mike Love gets us up to third gear. But ""409"" sounds like a middling test-run from the Chuck Berry rip-off days, and the dippy ""Hawaii"" is interesting only as history (""I don't know what town you're from, but don't tell me they have bigger waves/ Everyone that goes comes back with nothing but raves""). The meat of the lesser pre-Pet Sounds material are the songs that showed how far Brian Wilson's art had come even before he was considered a great artist. ""Let Him Run Wild"" (remixed for stereo here) is one of his most fully realized arrangements, the surging dynamics in the chorus perfectly mirroring the narrator's unhinged frustration at an unrequited lover's fondness for the bad boy, while Mike Love's ""guess you know I waited for you, girl"" bass part allows him to regain his composure. ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"" follows, and then when the bass notes introduce the breathtaking ""Wendy"" (also in a new stereo mix, with the famous cough deleted), we get the perfect triptych of romantic longing, Beach Boys-style. Then come the post-Smile years, from which The Warmth of the Sun chooses remarkably well. Songs like ""Forever"", ""Friends"", and ""Feel Flows"" demonstrate how they turned into a very capable-- even adventurous-- group of songwriters. They were becoming ""West Coast"" in the 70s sense of the term, with songs that were tuneful, professionally sung and recorded, laidback, and vaguely spiritual. Throw in ""Til I Die"", ""Cool, Cool Water"" and the album version of ""Surf's Up"" and you're talking about tremendously sophisticated pop that ably extended the innovations of the 60s, admittedly by recycling old ideas. We end, appropriately enough, with the couples-only prom-night classic ""Warmth of the Sun"". In addition to being one of the Beach Boys' most beautiful ballads, it also represents Capitol's hopes for the continuing appeal of the band's catalog, a collective wish that their music is permanently embedded in pop music's DNA, and that it, like the warmth of the sun itself, will only grow stronger in the coming years. As long as these kinds of smartly sequenced compilations keep on coming, such longevity seems like a safe bet.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10271-the-warmth-of-the-sun/,Capitol,2007.0
361,Betty Davis,Betty Davis,Pop/R&B,8.9,May 22 2007,Joshua Klein,,"It's rare that a pop history footnote looms as large as the figures she's meant to support, but then again, Betty Davis is one hell of a footnote. Malcolm Gladwell groupies can tell you all about ""connectors,"" roaming person-to-person hubs that link disparate corners of society. Well, in the late 1960s, Betty Davis-- then Betty Mabry-- was the link connecting such luminaries as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Miles Davis, the latter ultimately contributing his last name through a relatively short but tumultuous marriage. His 1968 album Filles de Kilimanjaro features then-model Betty on the cover; the track ""Mademoiselle Mabry"" was inspired by her. As legend has it, Miles grew jealous of Betty's friendship with Hendrix (which Miles allegedly suspected may have been more than that), but Betty's place in the middle of this intersection of geniuses apparently resulted in more than just divorce filings. By popular account, it was Betty who turned Miles on to Sly and Jimi, which in turn may have been the catalyst for Miles' most radical musical evolution: the still awe-inspiring Bitches Brew, released in 1970, a year after his separation from Betty. Betty Davis' own response was her self-titled 1973 debut, a groundbreaking slab of funk that featured a huge hunk of the Family Stone (it was produced by drummer Greg Errico) and fused soul, sex, and hard rock like the best Sly or Funkadelic disc, albeit from a female perspective. But if George Clinton waved his freak flag proudly, Betty Davis wore it as underwear then rubbed your face in it. An oft-quoted passage in Miles Davis' autobiography gets it just right: ""If Betty were singing today she be something like Madonna, something like Prince, only as a woman,"" wrote Davis back in 1989. ""She was the beginning of all that when she was singing as Betty Davis."" No doubt. Betty Davis never gives up in its aim to seduce and destroy; songs like ""If I'm In Luck I Might Get Picked Up"", ""Ooh Yeah"", and ""Game is My Middle Name"" are raw and relentless in their intent. Then-Afrophile nympho Brian Eno might have called it Music for Fucking, though the semi-classic ""Anti Love Song"" is music for fucking with, specifically fucking with a former lover many suspect is Miles, but who might as well be any man stupid enough to do Betty wrong (in every sense). Davis' part banshee/part Amazon shriek isn't the smoothest delivery system for seduction, but it does get the point across. Supposedly it was Marc Bolan who encouraged Davis to write her own songs, and there's no question Davis understood the best way for her to perform them was to wail like she was about to bite someone's head off. As underscored by Oliver Wang's informative liner notes (drawn in part from one of the only interviews Davis has consented to in the last several decades), Davis' ever-growing sense of empowerment played a part in her decision to self-produce her 1974 record, They Say I'm Different. While the self-titled disc's band (which also included Neal Schon on guitar and future disco queen Sylvester on backing vocals) was dissolved, the sound remained mostly the same, and Davis' outré sexuality just as out there. On ""He Was a Big Freak"", she essentially spars with a lover over who is freakier: the whipped or the whip-wielder. ""Git In There"" is house party in progress. The defensive title track finds Davis casting herself against her grandfather's more traditional blues favorites, while ""Don't Call Her No Tramp"" makes a distinction between an ""elegant hustler"" and a hooker (according to Wang, the song drew the ire of the NAACP for its ""demeaning"" depiction of black women). It's a slightly slicker album than its predecessor, but no less unreserved. Yet despite the fact that these albums drip with personality, Betty Davis remains something of an enigma. Her catalog (including a short but confusing and uneven string of follow-ups to They Say I'm Different) have gone in and out of print over the years, while the singer herself is reportedly living in Pittsburgh, broke, bemused but largely ignoring the attention her brief career continues to garner. And no wonder: Light in the Attic claims Davis never received any royalties from previous releases. Without steady checks coming in, what's cult fame even worth? Better to just keep on keeping on and let other folks parse out the legacy, but hopefully these reissues will remedy the situation. Anyone whose albums sound as electric as ever over 30 years late deserves more than Davis has received.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11903-betty-davis-they-say-im-different/,"Just Sunshine,Just Sunshine,Light in the Attic,Light in the Attic",1973.0
362,Lil Wayne,Da Drought 3,Rap,8.5,May 16 2007,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"""Everybody in this fuckin' game got the game fucked up. Work, man, work. I feel you, Nas, the new rappers today, they act like R&B singers. Man, what is you done?! Go into the studio with clips-- ammo: positive subjects, bitches, niggas, fake niggas, club song, ho's that shake their... Who am I shootin' at? I got bullets for days."" -- Lil Wayne rant on YouTube It's no secret: Nowadays, most mainstream rappers aren’t rappers. The majority just throw a few bars together around Christmastime before getting back to their real hustle, whether it be acting, designing clothes, or thinking about how to make Rick Ross the next Biggie Smalls while sitting behind a desk in a sharp suit. So when Lil Wayne calls himself the ""best rapper alive,"" the claim isn't that controversial-- it increasingly seems like he's one of the only rappers alive. And he's pissed (see above). With Hip-Hop Is Dead, Nas tried to resuscitate the culture with a hit-and-miss jumble of grumpy nostalgia and over-the-hill soul-searching; it was a far cry from indie-rap's nagging grandmother pose, but the album didn't hold much hope or promise for the future. With its free-associative, intangible, postmodern pull, Da Drought 3, by contrast, sounds a lot like the future. Released on the internet for free, the 29-track, 100-plus minute, DJ-less behemoth finds Lil Wayne sidestepping the music industry-- and the mixtape industry-- while delivering similes, jokes, and flows by the ton. After last year's stunning Dedication 2 tape with DJ Drama, Da Drought 3 ups the ante in almost every way possible. To use a distinctly Wayne-ian analogy-- that is, part '80s baby trivia, part ridiculous, all true-- the New Orleans native is akin to one-time ""American Gladiators"" champion Wesley ""Two Scoops"" Berry. Like Berry, Wayne goes headlong into an inherently absurd competitive atmosphere (i.e. modern hip-hop) and dominates. He scoots around giants, making the most of his nimble, versatile patter. No longer satisfied with being a southern rap ambassador, Wayne emphasizes his range with a cross-country, cross-generational, cross-genre beat selection here, from the Southern R&B of Ciara's ""Promise"" to the neo-soul of Gnarls Barkley's ""Crazy"" to the moody New York bap of Jay-Z's ""Dead Presidents II."" It's effortlessly encompassing. Then there's the quicksilver flow and morphing subject matter, from the West Coast gangsta-isms of ""I'm Blooded"" to the off-the-wall Cam'ron-esque abstractions of ""Live from 504"" to the MF Doom-style kitchen talk. No assembly required-- everything to everybody. It's fitting, then, for the MC to start the album off rhyming over a snap music smash (""This Is Why I'm Hot"") originally made by a New York rapper (MIMS) trying to pander to a nationwide audience. As if to underline his alien mystique (""I am just a Martian, ain't nobody else on this planet""), Wayne goes international on the track, working a Jamaican flow simply because he can. Later, while introducing his revamp of T.I.'s ""Top Back"", Wayne clarifies, ""T.I. is the king-- don’t get that shit twisted/ And me? I am the best rapper alive."" The difference-- divine right vs. tireless politicking-- is spelled out through Wayne's regional-poaching as high-art stumping. Work, man, work. At one point, Wayne poses the question, ""I'm crazy for bein' Wayne or is Wayne just crazy?"" And while that chicken/egg query may be unanswerable, there's no doubt Wayne makes several insane decisions on Da Drought 3-- choices no other rapper would ever consider. Take ""My Daddy"", Wayne's spirited defense of his close relationship with surrogate father Brian ""Baby"" Williams over Danjahandz's untouchable ""We Takin' Over"" beat. Instead of just ignoring the hubbub, Wayne calls attention to it with one of the set's most jaw-dropping tracks. When he says, ""Damn right, I kissed my daddy,"" it's not a confession as much as a chest-pumping pronouncement, i.e. why don't you kiss your daddy? Then, the heartfelt justification: ""Who was there when no one wasn’t? Just my daddy."" Finally, Wayne goes into light-speed, forgoing typical syntax for a trail of breathless keywords: ""Beef, yes, chest, feet, tag, bag, blood, sheets, yikes, yeeks, great, Scott, Storch, can I borrow your yacht?"" And just like that, a winning defense turns into a staggering offense. More zaniness as Wayne gets all MySpace stalker over Ciara's ""Promise"" with a love letter to the Atlanta R&B singer that's at once nebbish, cartoony, hilarious, and sweet. ""I know that this is pretty awkward for me,"" he mumbles, his typical playboy routine neutered by a celebrity crush. Even after countless, detailed blowjob verses and rhymes about slipping women pills to get them into bed, the rapper's crazy-in-love yammering (""Nasty as I wanna be or nasty as you like me to be/ I hope you like me too now you know I like you too"") somehow still comes off as earnest. It's a rare moment when Wayne comes down from his interplanetary star-search and joins every other guy who's fallen for Ciara's ""Promise"" video. ""That chair or stool move was cool,"" he gushes. Yeah, it was. Along with its bounty of blog-worthy one-liners (Wayne can be heard imitating Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Bernie Mac and Bobcat Goldthwait across the record) and its fascinating internal weed/food cycle (which you can read about in Julianne Shepherd's recent column), this latest opus from Lil Wayne is marked with a beguiling sense of infatuation. The rapper is in love with language, left-field references to Gremlins and Harry and the Hendersons, the man who helped raise him, his hometown, Ciara and-- even after more than 10 years of professional experience-- hip-hop itself: ""I just love music, I love to rap, I love what I do,"" he says.

363,James Brown,"The Singles, Volume Two: 1960-1963",Rock,8.3,May 2 2007,Douglas Wolk,Contributor,"In the early 1960s, James Brown was a hustler. As his nickname suggested, he worked unbelievably hard, touring 300 days a year and playing as many as five shows a day. Hustlers have to be flexible, and Brown treated his records as advertisements for his live gigs; it was in his interest to get across the idea that whatever kind of thing the audience wanted to hear would probably be part of his show. Of the 20 singles (two unreleased at the time) whose A- and B-sides are collected on this volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only exercise in blessed completism, 13 were chart hits, and it's still easy not to have heard most of them, wedged as they are between the roaring soul of his early years and the funk he'd invent a few years later-- only ""Night Train"" appears on his 20 All-Time Greatest Hits. Beyond that half-instrumental cover of a 1952 Jimmy Forrest r&b hit, they include three 30s-era pop songs, one of them recorded with an orchestra and a choir; a raw, frantic ripoff of the Isley Brothers' ""Shout""; a trio of delicately balanced original ballads with Brown's voice slicing across their grain; covers of country hits by Kay Starr (faithful-ish) and Cowboy Copas (unrecognizable); a mashed-potatoes riff offhandedly overdubbed with JB yelping his tour itinerary; a 10-year-old R&B tune that had recently been a hit for Gladys Knight, recast as an organ instrumental; and a two-part secularized version of the gospel tune ""Mary Don't You Weep"". That's an enormous variety of stuff-- even more enormous, if you count B-sides and non-hits like the incredible rock'n'roll freakout ""I've Got Money"" and the scenery-chewing blues ""The Bells""-- and it also encompasses a lot of covers. (Some are unacknowledged, like the instrumental ""Night Flying"", a not-fooling-anybody variation on Bill Doggett's ""Honky Tonk"".) Brown's discography in these years was shaped by his ongoing tussles with King Records, which had moved him up from the less-promoted Federal imprint but encouraged him to cover songs from its publishing catalogue. By 1963, when Live at the Apollo was the hottest album in r&b and Brown was selling out venues across the country, he was practically on strike against King, and they were pumping out whatever ballast happened to be in the archives. Fortunately, most of the ballast was still pretty juicy. Brown's band in this period was one of his best: The rubber-band note-snaps of guitarist Les Buie, and the New Orleans second-line-inspired clatter of drummer Clayton Fillyau (or Fillyua; he's identified both ways in the extensive liner notes), gave the group its toughest attack yet. And Brown's voice was as monstrously strong and supple as it ever got. Mr. Dynamite hadn't figured out how he was going to change the world yet, but he knew he had to get everyone's attention first.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10159-the-singles-volume-two-1960-1963/,Hip-O Select,2007.0
364,Amy Winehouse,Back to Black,Pop/R&B,6.4,March 28 2007,Joshua Klein,,"""They tried to make me go to rehab,"" wails Amy Winehouse on the opening track and first single from her second album Back to Black. It's not typical pop song fodder, but Winehouse isn't a typical pop singer. If she winds up as popular in the U.S. as she is at home in the UK, it'll be despite her reluctance to embrace the monotonous realities of promotional mechanics. Oh, she'll talk, but there's no guarantee what she'll say. (Our favorite is her heckling of Bono at last year's Q Awards: ""Shut up, I don't give a fuck!"") She'll be scheduled to perform, but there's no guarantee what she'll do, or even if she'll make it through the show. And she'll sing about her problems, but she won't give a shit what you think of them. If this makes Winehouse read a little like Lily Allen, that's not far off the mark. Both are larger-than-life singers who've found perfect vehicles for their outsized personalities. In Allen's case, it's a cocktail of pop, reggae, and hip-hop, with a cigarette in hand; for Winehouse, it's soul, jazz, and blues with a bottle of booze. Both pay tribute to their influences, with Winehouse's lyrics featuring shout-outs to Ray Charles, Donny Hathaway, and Slick Rick, and the two even share a producer: Mark Ronson, who's also worked with everyone from Sean Paul and Macy Gray to Ghostface and Rhymefest. But Winehouse is anything but a Lily Allen doppelgÃ¤nger. After all, soul and jazz music are typically considered the province of grownups, and while Winehouse could be accused of slipping on these styles like costumes, she imbues her music with a surprisingly genuine soulfulness. Ronson's sneaky production provides most of the album's wit: The old school backdrop to ""Me & Mr. Jones"" is especially winking against couplets like ""What kind of fuckery is this? You made me miss the Slick Rick gig."" But Winehouse's zingers (in that same song she tells her subject ""'side from Sammy you're my best black Jew"") and profane interjections (the title track begins ""He left no time to regret/ Kept his dick wet"") are only an occasional thing as she travels a well-worn lyrical path to both clinical and romantic rehabilitation. Songs like ""Love Is a Losing Game"" are full of regret, even if Winehouse refuses to wallow entirely in self-pity. However, as one might expect following the declaration of ""Rehab"", Winehouse does spend much of Back to Black on the defensive, trying to explain why she's stayed with the same guy who's done her wrong, or, in the case of ""Wake Up Alone"", why her ex gives her the night sweats (""I drip for him tonight,"" Winehouse less delicately puts it). It's one of the eternal themes of soul music, here spiced up with post-modern production where less forceful personalities might have gone with strictly retro emulation. The references to girl groups, northern soul, and ska are there, but no one would confuse these approximations (split evenly between Ronson and Salaam Remi, who produced Winehouse's since-disowned debut) with the real thing. Fortunately, Winehouse has been blessed by a brassy voice that can transform even mundane sentiments into powerful statements. She may be heartbroken, but she uses that ache, twisting the emotional scars to suit her songs-- and if she often seems like the masochistic recipient of each knife twist, so be it. It's not until the album's final track, ""He Can Only Hold Her"", that Winehouse finally switches from first person to third, the ""I""s and ""me""s giving way to ""he""s and ""she""s, suggesting that she's finally become an objective observer, able to see her personal issues for what they are. ""He tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside never dies,"" she sings, and we can only assume from this new vantage that Winehouse has moved on.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10032-back-to-black/,Interscope,2007.0
365,Johnny Cash,Ultimate Gospel,Folk/Country,6.3,February 28 2007,Joshua Klein,,"Johnny Cash's late-career rebirth has few parallels in modern pop history. But it's remarkable nonetheless that in 2006, three years after his death, Cash's five million records sold in the U.S. made him the year's second-most successful artist, right behind Rascal Flatts (but, satisfyingly, well ahead of Nickelback). That's a pretty big number-- twice Justin Timberlake's tally-- but somewhat explainable. 2005's Walk the Line helped solidify Cash's status as a great American icon, just as a steady stream of Rick Rubin-helmed comeback discs demonstrated his powers had barely been diminished by age and illness. Cash was one of the few acts that everybody-- young and old, cool and conservative, country or pop-- could embrace. Those numbers being what they are, though, don't expect the Cash releases to slow down anytime soon. In the past few years alone, Cash has inspired new career-spanning boxed sets, best-ofs, expanded live albums, June Carter Cash duets, and Personal File, a collection of unreleased demos. Following 2006's at the time allegedly ""final"" American V: A Hundred Highways, Rubin has even announced a sixth volume of the series. Now comes Ultimate Gospel, a collection of Cash's spiritual work. Cash had been recording gospel material from the start but particularly throughout his later years. Most recently he completed the moving My Mother's Hymn Book as part of the Unearthed boxed set (it was subsequently re-released as a stand-alone set), songs his mother once sang that Cash took with him (both literally and figuratively) everywhere he went. Even when his longtime label Columbia occasionally lost faith in the marketability of gospel, Cash kept cranking out the discs at semi-regular intervals, jumping ship to smaller labels when need be to get the music out. Lately, gospel-- not to mention fundamentalist Christianity-- has been experiencing something of a renaissance, so it's no shock that the same label that sometimes frowned upon Cash's religious recordings is eager to revisit them today. But times are different. Big music names from Bono to Mary J. Blige to Arcade Fire are believers of the highest order, but they generally get a free pass from all but the most staunchly secularist followers of Richard Dawkins. Besides, Cash's own born-again story is perfectly in line with the singer's other mythic American, larger than life tales: In 1967, hopped up on speed, Cash crawled into Nickajack Cave and prepared to die, until he felt the hand of God point him to salvation. He married June Carter the following year and lead a life of devout Christianity until his demise. Yet Cash's relationship to God was complex (as non-Christian friends like Rubin would later attest). He believed, but he didn't always believe what other believers believed. For Cash, religion was strictly personal, and recording gospel was part of his own ongoing rehabilitation, a way to reconnect with his roots and keep him spiritually focused rather than simply a means to draw converts. That's one reason Cash was never branded a Christian artist per se, even though Ultimate Gospel includes explicitly Christian music, a little more than half of it traditional, which he'd been recording since the 50s. Starting with a live 1970 Grand Ole Opry take on Johnny Bond and Tex Ritter's ""Here Was a Man"" may be conceptually sound, but it drags on at under three minutes and paints Cash as something he wasn't: a bore. Likewise, the next track, 1971's ""The Preacher Said, 'Jesus Said'"", a partly spoken-word collaboration with Rev. Billy Graham, comes off kitschy despite its clear convictions. That's the thin line Ultimate Gospel walks for most of its duration. It's music for the devout, sure, but it can also be corny. Not coincidentally, Cash's Ultimate Gospel is being marketed alongside an Elvis Presley Ultimate Gospel collection, underscoring the seldom-spoken connection between the two former peers. Both remained icons throughout the 70s, but musically they were each pretty moribund. Needless to say, the best tracks on Ultimate Gospel are those that show Cash at his (first) peak, either recording in the 50s with the Tennessee Two or the 60s with the Carter Family (though 1968's ""Daddy Sang Bass"" is a questionable gospel standard). By the 70s, even as country grew more fashionable, Johnny Cash grew less so, and the songs from that decade included here-- like ""Far Side Banks of Jordan"" or a lite-fare version of the generally redoubtable ""Amazing Grace""-- are notable only for their ordinariness. It took another couple of decades for Cash to get his mojo back, with albums more gripping, creative, and spiritually stirring than a lot of what's repackaged here. Fittingly, as Cash grew older and sicklier, his religious songs packed more weight than many included on this comp. ""Spiritual"", from 1996's Unchained, marks one of Cash's greatest vocal performances, and ""When the Man Comes Around"" and ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"" (from volumes four and five of the American series, respectively) are as fervently, feverishly apocalyptic as anything Cash ever recorded. Besides, the struggle between his better nature and his demons was the dramatic conflict that often made Cash so compelling-- ""The Beast in Me"", former son-in-law Nick Lowe's contribution to the American Recordings disc summed it up pretty well-- and listening to a set composed strictly of spiritual songs sacrifices much of that drama for the sake of (ironically) marketing. But what's God without the Devil? What's to be gained from listening to the devout preach to the converted without getting the other side-- damnation, the cost of giving in to temptation? Listening to Cash embrace his innate goodness isn't a bad trip by any stretch, but that innate goodness is only a small part of what made Cash great.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9934-ultimate-gospel/,"Columbia,Legacy",2007.0
366,Neko Case,"Live from Austin, TX: Austin City Limits",Folk/Country,5.5,January 8 2007,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"Once upon a time, all country singers aspired to play the Grand Ole Opry. Or at least that's what Robert Altman taught me. Today, even though the Opry has sunk to a C-list country music channel and hocked itself as the setting for a reality TV show, some of the luster of the old red barn backdrop still remains. But for the lowly denizens of the alt-country world, a performance at the Opry remains far out of reach. Nevertheless, Neko Case almost made herself into prime material for a Disney underdog biopic by defying these odds, drawing an invite to an Opry-related event (if not the actual stage) in 2002. Alas, the potential for her to be triumphantly portrayed by Julia Roberts was squandered at that same event, when she was ceremoniously banned from the Grand Ole for shirtlessness-- a piece of lore that appeared, usually in exaggerated form, as the wacky story in every Case profile until her infamous Playboy poll victory (""Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock"", April 2003). Whatever the saucy details, Case must now settle for the same minor-league version of the Opry as her peers, the Austin-based and PBS-supported Austin City Limits. Not that ACL is anything to scoff at; the show has seen hundreds of artists give intimate soundstage performances gentle and non-threatening enough to fit between Jim Lehrer and ""Nova"". Case's unimpeachable combination of cred and rootsy traditionalism would seem to make her obvious programming for this timeslot. But Case as a performer is a less-than-perfect tenant for the Austin skyline, as reflected by this August 2003 live set which comprises the latest installment in the Austin City Limits CD/DVD series. On her prior live album, The Tigers Have Spoken, Case sounded at home in the boozier environment of the rock club, trading licks and harmonies with members of the Sadies on originals and spiritual covers. Here, Case chooses a stripped-down band-- only banjo or slide and bass accompanying her rhythm guitar-- and the show's producers oblige by mixing her voice twice as loud as any other instrument present in the recording. Locking the spotlight on Case's vocoder-flexible, mousse-rich voice is the obvious directorial call, but so sparse an approach undercuts her less-touted gifts as a songwriter, draining the texture out of tracks like ""Outro With Bees"" and ""Knock Loud"" and leaving only half-finished husks behind. This doesn't apply to every track-- no amount of minimalism can dispel the dramatic fog that pervades ""Deep Red Bells"" or ""Furnace Room Lullaby""-- but minus the cavernous reverb and home-recorded coziness of her recorded work, Case can only rely on her flair for disturbing digression (the gory deer-dream of ""Favorite"") to add a creepily unique edge to what passes for love songs in her songbook. Unsurprisingly then, the ACL soundstage sounds more natural on the covers Case chooses, be it folk standard ""Wayfaring Stranger"" or Bob Dylan's ""Buckets of Rain"". Even Lisa Marr's ""In California""-- as textbook a TV drama soundtrack song as I've ever heard-- is improved by Case's gentle reading, taming her vocal weaponry just enough to avoid drowning the song's melancholy in slippery notes and twang. That voice, that voice, that voice; so technically sharp and character-rich, it keeps hogging the attention, especially in this empty environment. Where her recorded work uses shadowy mood and ragged edges to evade any diva accusations and make her albums safe for those who listen to ""everything but country,"" the Austin City Limits performance finds her playing her talents straight. While Case's voice may have been her ticket to the Opry, this record is proof that, even in more humble surroundings, it's unsatisfying to hear her lean too hard on that crutch.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9745-live-from-austin-tx-austin-city-limits/,New West,2007.0
367,Nas,Hip Hop Is Dead,Rap,7.8,December 15 2006,Peter Macia,Contributor,"For all the youngsters and dabblers out there, hip-hop is not dead, so calm down. If anything, hip-hop is deaf. Rappers, bloggers, and fans have become so averse to criticism that the mere title of this album flung them into defensive hysterics. So, Nas' plan worked. People are at least trying to come up with reasons why hip-hop is indeed alive instead of just stealing an album per week and dropping weird science on the internet. He wants us to care again, to think when we listen instead of simply consuming, because his career and the survival of the culture depend on it. Nas couldn't be a pop guy, even with Puff's help. He couldn't write a club song if his life was at stake, which, after ""Oochie Wally"" it probably should have been. And he certainly isn't going to make any money off his crew (see also: ""Oochie Wally""). Nas is a writer, and he needs our attention. He needs us to read lines, between the lines, put it all together. He needs us to give a fuck about the art, the history, and the craft or we won't get what he's saying. Hip-hop isn't dying because Nas hates it; it's dying because not enough people love it. If that sounds corny or offensive, well, there's the rub, and Hip Hop Is Dead is made for you. If you lecture on rap forums all day, post daily pics on your blog of Lil' Wayne kissing people, wonder why we write about hip-hop on this site, or just want to know what the best rapper alive really sounds like, listen to this album. For everyone else, the standard Nas disclaimer: Hip Hop Is Dead is not Illmatic. Nothing ever will be. Nas and I are roughly the same age, so when his debut came out in 1994, it was a humbling experience for me. I was struggling through term papers while this slightly older dude from Queensbridge was writing the great literature of our generation and collaborating with producers I considered legendary. Pete Rock, Gang Starr's DJ Premier, Tribe's Q-Tip, and Large Professor of Main Source had produced a dozen or more of my favorite albums by the time they worked on Illmatic, and each dropped a gem on Nas, a rookie. (The Black Album was not the dawn of Dream Team production.) AZ, the only guest, got one verse on ""Life's a Bitch"", a verse so perfect it still haunts him in the same way Illmatic's every verse haunts Nas. It's a flawless album, my personal favorite, and I can listen to it today and not be bored for a second. Unfortunately, every album subsequent to Illmatic contained increasingly longer stretches of boredom, mine and Nas'. Even his recent ""comeback"" albums (aren't they all?), including the infamous ""Ether""-ing of Jay-Z on Stillmatic, were better in theory than in practice-- the go-to criticism of Nas, his poor taste in beats, holding true for every failure. But, he was also getting lazier, less-focused, saying things without thinking and probably smoking way too many blunts. It was largely a lost decade for Nasir Jones. When Nas signed with Jay-Z's Def Jam, I didn't guffaw. I didn't care. I was happy that Nas was making money, but I didn't believe rumors of a Nas/Premier reunion or the Return of Nasty Nas. It was what it was: a business deal. Whatever that deal promised Nas, though, pays off on Hip Hop Is Dead. He is, in fact, extremely nasty on almost every track, as committed and consistent as he's been in a long time. Beginning with the L.E.S. & Wyldfyer-produced royal rumbler, ""Money Over Bullshit"", Nas leans into the mic and doesn't fall back until he's said his last word on the a capella ""Hope"". The two tracks with Kanye West are exceptional for both artists, confirming the chemistry of Late Registration's ""We Major"" and bracketing the meditative middle of the album. On either side of that soulful stretch are ""Black Republican"", the fantasy duet with Jay, and ""Hustlers"", or, Make-a-Wish for the Game. Jay and Nas are so ridiculous on a track together, it's almost depressing that it took this long to happen, and the Godfather II sample is inspired. The Game, in what should be his template, sounds great rapping on a song with the rapper whose name he is dropping, especially when it's Nas, whom the Game most closely resembles. The closeness of their voices actually makes the Game more tolerable by osmosis. A few of the beats are mediocre, which, again, is Nas' Achilles Heel. But if I'm going to talk negatives, it's really only necessary to mention one song. Will.i.am produced three on the album, and all of them, at least his contribution to them, are decent to good. However, ""Who Killed It?"", Will's odd nursery-noir beat, is the worst concept song in the history of hip-hop music. Normally, I'm with Nas any time he wants to inhabit a persona or inanimate object, but here he assumes the voice of-- I shit you not-- character actor Edward G. Robinson (kids: think Chief Wiggum). The first time I heard it, I was genuinely shocked. The content is irrelevant. Truly, deeply embarrassing, but that's what the delete key is for, people. Let's hope it was the Black Eyed Pea's idea. At least Nas is trying again, though. He's pushing himself, and that's what his appeal has always been. He's a virtuoso MC, but it has never been about style over substance or dazzling technique. Don't get me wrong, there are verses on Hip Hop in which he rattles off minute-long torrents with more internal rhymes than Rick Ross had rhymes in toto on his album. But Nas is telling stories again and attacking the mic, and that is what is important. While his successors might impress with intricate wordplay, too often they're just saying what's on their minds instead of getting something off their chests. Maybe that's what Nas means by Hip Hop Is Dead, that the art of rhyme is lost, but he also must accept some of the blame that he liberally places on others. It was his lack of effort, after all, that created a vacuum for others to fill with emptiness. In the end, Hip Hop Is Dead is the album I'll give to people in 20 years when they ask who Nas was. More than Illmatic, it represents the real Nas-- not the ideal-- the MC with all the skill, all the rhymes, and all the insight who sabotaged himself with bad decisions. There aren't too many here, which is why I'll recommend it. Whether he will revive hip-hop or not is for history to decide; I'm not sure it needs reviving. The need for Nas to play a vital role in whatever happens, though, is something I am sure of, so I'm glad he's back with the living.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9729-hip-hop-is-dead/,Def Jam,2006.0
368,The Doors,Perception,Rock,6.5,December 5 2006,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"The Doors aren't so much a band as a phase you go through, rarely to be visited again, like so much of the high-school-notebook poetry that Jim Morrison's lyrics inspired. Though their songs could be as transgressive as the Velvet Underground's, the Doors are denied the same name-drop cachet, their legend reduced to a punchline-- no thanks to a 1991 Oliver Stone biopic more self-indulgent than the band itself, and recent efforts by Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger to revive the band with Ian Astbury as the Doors of the 21st century, like some reality-TV-show experiment minus the TV-show part. Amid these sorry attempts to update the Doors' legacy, it's easy to forget that without Morrison's brooding baritone, there'd be no Iggy, no Ian Curtis, and it's safe to say that Morrison taught Bono more about rocking a Jesus Christ pose than JC himself. So Perception's extensive repackaging of the Doors' six albums (each complemented by a bonus disc of DVD footage and Surround Sound mixes) arrives at a fortuitous time-- not because it coincides with the band's 40th anniversary, but because it helps contemporize a band tethered to a 1960s hippie ideal to which, spiritually, it often stood in opposition. For all the mythology surrounding the band, the Doors-- like so many 60s garage-rockers-- arguably peaked with their first single. ""Break on Through (To the Other Side)"" is a taunt and a dare, drawing the line between who was down and who was out. But the 1967 debut album that the song introduced wasn't your typical Nuggets-variety noise, looking to the Weill/Brecht songbook for ""Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)"" and beyond pop structure entirely for ""The End"". The 11-minute closer set the standard for the Doors' long songs: Morrison dropping stream-of-consciousness prose in the place where most bands would put the guitar solo, his words gradually wearing down the players' accompaniment before summoning them back for the climax. ""The End"" is also the song that helped define the Morrison caricature as pabulum-spouting narcissist, but the song's ominous drift-- guided by Krieger's sinister riff and disrupted by Morrison's Oedipal intimations-- remains eerily compelling, and established the sex/death dichotomy that would play out in so many Doors songs. (Also: the song is actually shorter than you remembered: The Doors was originally mastered at a slightly slower speed, due to technical error that's been corrected by Perception's new version-- so you'll get a few seconds of your life back.) History has relegated 1969's The Soft Parade to the same Spectacular Failure file as the Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request; the problem, however, isn't the opulent TV talk-show orchestra arrangements (which lend ""Touch Me"" a schmaltzy charm) but the bloodless, Fat Elvis performances. A DVD performance clip of the title-track suite makes for a fitting summation of the Doors' half-hearted dalliance with symphonic psychedelia and their subsequent abandonment of it: John Densmore and Krieger look bored and embarrassed performing the song's poncey opening passages, before the game-saving swamp-funk finale allows a bloated, bearded Morrison to reconnect with his younger, more dynamic self. Like so many of their peers, the Doors responded to the post-hippie hangover with a back-to-basics approach (read: the blues, man) that informed their last two albums, 1970's Morrison Hotel and 71's L.A. Woman-- though the significance of this move is overstated by Perception's inclusion of eight (mostly incomplete) consecutive session takes of ""Roadhouse Blues"" that merely chart the song's evolution from sloppy bar-band jam to somewhat less sloppy bar-band jam (though the between-song banter is amusing). L.A. Woman is also marred by its share of blooze snoozes (""Crawling King Snake"") but finds the band effectively shaping up for the hard-rock 70s with the hypno-grooved title track and ""The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)"", the most successful union of the band's bluesy tendencies and Morrison's beat-poet babble. But even if his death was still months away, on ""Riders on the Storm"" Morrison has already turned into a ghost, lending the song an eternally haunted quality that even the band's detractors can't deny. When Morrison first urged his fans to break on through, he wasn't asking for their money, he was asking for a commitment. At $120 and 12 discs, Perception is asking for both, but the audiophile end of the fanbase will be pleased by the new masters (as well as engineer Bruce Botnick's gearhead-oriented liner notes). In contrast to the multi-tracked splendor of much 60s psychedelic rock, the Doors made great use of space, a virtue highlighted by the new masters' foregrounding of the two most overlooked Doors: guitarist Krieger, whose finger-picked leads so often took a backseat to Manzarek's organ arpeggios; and drummer Densmore, whose playing hits harder the lighter his touch. The band's prolific album output means Perception offers little in the way of essential leftovers, but that's more of a relief than anything. The lasting perception of Perception: Had the Doors' six albums been condensed to three-- cherry-picking the best material from The Doors/Strange Days, Waiting for the Sun/The Soft Parade and Morrison Hotel/L.A. Woman-- the band would've had a discography as airtight as Jimi Hendrix's. Instead, each ensuing album-- drawn from increasingly depleted sources of inspired material and an increasingly intoxicated frontman-- put greater stress on the band's internal contradictions: A proto-punk band with baroque-classical aspirations, fronted by a California-dreamy pop idol who really wanted to be a reclusive fat beardo poet in Paris-- a would-be idealist who made a more convincing nihilist. The singer's decline is laid bare in Perception's DVD clips: While an entrancing 1967 Canadian television performance of ""The End"" (incest rant excised) focuses on the young Morrison's face to the point of denying the other band members' existence, a grainy 1970 Australian live taping of ""Crawling King Snake"" seems to be deliberately avoiding his burly figure. By placing these images alongside the erratic artistic trajectory that plays out on Perception's six discs, we see that Morrison was not just a victim of his own excess, but also an early victim of a burgeoning music-business machine that demanded quantity over quality, regardless of the personal or creative toll.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9691-perception/,"Elektra,Rhino",2006.0
369,Depeche Mode,The Best of Vol. 1,"Electronic,Rock",8.2,November 30 2006,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"At this point I have accepted my role as one of Pitchfork's go-to ""Best of"" and reissue guys. I'm old and cranky. My interests these days are bourbon, my bicycle, and the collected works of Al Green. And Pitchfork has already reviewed approximately 90,000 Depeche Mode albums, reissues, and compilations. (Nitsuh Abebe alone has reviewed 67,843 of them.) What's possibly left to say about these 18 songs except that capitalism marches ever onward? Or that if you really needed to hear a few songs off 2001's Exciter and 2005's Playing the Angel-- and, of course, one new tune-- that now you've got your chance? When I was in the early days of high school, a time when kids in my study hall thought the riff in Collective Soul's ""Shine"" was, like, totally boss, Depeche Mode were dismissed as a ""gay keyboard band"" by a friend's cousin, a sentiment probably echoed no less than 2 million times over the past 20 years. We thought he was hella cool because he liked the Jesus Lizard and smoked unfiltered cigarettes. Actually, he was a douchebag who probably has throat cancer now. And though the Jesus Lizard are still great and his statement was perhaps accurate as a description, it doesn't stand up as criticism. Depeche Mode were a great keyboard band. Especially at the beginning, the band offered synthetic, electric hooks as pure and sugary as New Edition, something that's easy to forget with all the iron crucifixes and black-and-white videos that followed (a period which itself is not without its charms). Depeche more or less were formed in 1976 by Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher as No Romance in China. By 1980, they had settled into the name they're best remembered for and the basic lineup of Clark, Fletcher, Martin Gore, and Dave Gahan on vocals. Long before he was a strung out Jack Sparrow-- amazingly Googling ""Dave Gahan"", ""Jack Sparrow"" brought up not only results but Depeche Mode/dead pirate slash, proving once again that goth kids will never disappoint-- this dude was Lance Bass with vinyl vests and jaunty little caps. Clarke left to form Yaz and then Erasure right after Depeche scored their first major hits, the British Top 10 ""Just Can't Get Enough"" and its parent album Speak and Spell. The remaining Depechies listened to their scary DAF records and knew that a whole generation of the sexually frustrated could relate, were it garnished with pretty Eurotrash boys with ropey arms and peroxide dye jobs and lyrics about how hard it is to be a sensitive flower. Being a sensitive flower who once tried to impress a girl by pointing out how much the lead character in Sandman looked like Robert Smith, you'd think this would have been right up my alley. But despite buying Joy Division albums through Columbia House, I was never a goth, and I listened to too much pop-punk and hardcore as a teenager to really lay back and wallow. ""Everything Counts"", from 1983's mini-mall industrial Construction Time Again, was recorded with newest member Alan Wilder. Gahan's voice had deepened and so had the timbre of the synthesizers; Depeche Mode would be catchy again, but they would never be upbeat. Leather and eyeliner were never part of my world; I wore the same Chuck Taylors and black T-shirt throughout high school. Even though I've got the requisite fucked up emotions when it comes to the meeting of sex and religious imagery, Depeche Mode's heavy-breathing lapsed Catholicism may have meant more if they, like me, dressed like the Ramones. On the other hand, they meant a hell of a lot to a hell of a lot of other people. By the end of the 1980s, Depeche were, if not causing rioting in the streets, coming close enough: They were a legit teen phenomenon. Some Great Reward was the breakthrough. If the early records could sound thin and blippy, ""Master and Servant"" had the kind of Bonham-heavy drum machines that could reach the cheap seats in the stadiums the band clearly wanted to be playing to and would be soon enough. The band perfected a kind of music that you could do a sort of acute gastrointestinal disorder shuffle to, as kids without a funky bone in their bodies laced up their Doc Martins and gathered in pool halls and roller rinks done up in blacklight. The Best of Volume 1 gives the short shrift to Black Celebration, the 1986 album that gave the gift of a name to goth club nights around the world. It turned out no real hits but it affirmed that Depeche Mode's sonic goal was total domination-- albeit domination that swayed with an anorexic's gait-- mixed with ballads that became mixtape staples. Music for the Masses (1987) made the ambition plain in the title. This was the beginning of Depeche's shift from synth-pop/fake-industrial/goth pioneers to ""modern rock"" pioneers, spoken of alongside New Order and, uh, World Party in that decade-changing pause for breath just before Nirvana briefly gave the keys to pop to guys like my friend's cousin and the Collective Soul fans in eighth period. ""Never Let Me Down Again"" plugs in the guitar, but it plugs it into the MIDI banks. Kinda rock, still mostly not. And then came Violator, the one Depeche Mode record that nearly everyone can agree on. Guitars! Like, actual prominent ones! As a few canny mixtape makers proved a few years ago, ""Personal Jesus"" is either throwback T.Rextacy or predicts Kompakt's techno-shuffle by a few billion years. Or it's both! Value for money! And you can listen to ""Enjoy the Silence"" alongside such sunny favorites as Jawbreaker's ""Sea Foam Green"". Emo! Songs of Faith and Devotion upped the grind/sleaze factor with singles like ""I Feel You"", but so did U2 during the middle of MacPhisto Madness, and you won't necessarily catch me stumping for that either. The band disappeared for a few years and returned with 97's Ultra (dingy, dubby, atmospheric, very pre-millennial tense) and 2001's Exciter (skeletal, grid-like, technoid, recorded under the director of LFO's Mark Bell), two turns toward the non-goth dancefloor that worked better remixed. If this review seems confused between the 8+ rating and being basically indifferent to the idea of another shakedown of Depeche Mode history, you're not reading it wrong. The band's still putting out records and is a respectable part of rock history and so, yeah, multiple best-ofs and collections and remix compilations follow. I mean, I get it, but I'm not sure I get it, you know? Despite the evangelical efforts of Mike Shinoda, et al., the kids, they are not, how you say, plunking down close to 20 crumpled tooth fairy bills for a copy of the Depeche Mode best-of. In Phillip Sherburne's recent ""Month in Techno"" column, he claims to have recently repurchased a chunk of the Depeche catalog in a fit of funk, lamenting the fact that he's turned into one of those old dudes salving his pain with nostalgia for, like, old pain. So that's what this is for! I've been a miserable bastard lately, and this collection has indeed transported me back to a time I didn't even go through at the time, when a kid's most pressing problems could be dealt with by drawing the shades for six to eight hours. I recently made my final trip to Tower Records, where people my age and up were snatching all sorts of greatest hits like it was a Black Friday white sale. Seeing people eyeball new records, at up to 70% off the sticker price, and still decide they weren't interested-- well, it was like watching the last days of Rome. Eventually, all music websites will be reviewing digital chunks downloaded directly into your cereal bowl every morning so you can be up on that prerelease leak as you eat your Wheaties. But best-of compilations will be among the last CDs to go. Those of us aghast and confused by the bleak, horrible future we've washed up in have to hold onto something.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9681-the-best-of-vol-1/,Mute,2006.0
370,The Beatles,Love,Rock,8.5,November 30 2006,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"John Lennon's ""Glass Onion"", a daffy throwaway from the Beatles' self-titled album, isn't among the band's best songs. But a snippet fits very nicely in the third position on Love, the Beatles catalog remix album and Cirque de Soleil soundtrack created by George Martin and his son Giles. After an angelic ""Because""-- a capella, but here fluffed up with bird songs-- there's the ""A Hard Days Night"" chord into Ringo's drum solo on ""The End"", which then fades into ""Get Back"". ""Glass Onion"" was Lennon having fun with the Beatles myth, referencing his earlier songs and mocking the tendency to ""decode"" them that would eventually get way out of hand when Beach Boys pal and ""Never Learn Not to Love"" composer Charles Manson sent his minions into Beverly Hills to commit mass murder. ""Glass Onion"" was Lennon's attempt-- on the fly, while the band was at its peak-- at recontextualizing his Beatles work, to remind us all that music is supposed to be fun. The joker was laughing with us, jabbing an elbow in our sides to say, ""Hey, we're just a pop band here, folks."" That's a good thing to keep in mind with the Beatles. They were just a pop band, even if they were possibly the greatest entity ever to fit that particular classification. The Beatles were so good that they're not very interesting to talk about-- it's like listening to someone drone on about the Grand Canyon. No other band has generated as much dull commentary, even as the music remains unimpeachable. They're certainly the best band I almost never listen to. I'm guessing I share this with a lot of music obsessives; the Beatles' music has been so thoroughly absorbed into our consciousness that we can play the songs in our heads any time we like. Which is why the idea of someone doing something new with the catalog-- mixing and matching different songs, blending the whole thing into an epic suite-- is potentially exciting. Any attempt to fiddle with this music is like long-distance brain surgery, toying with our collective memory with the hope of creating something new. Listening to Love I'm reminded first of a few artists that took from the Beatles without their permission, and how illicit beginnings gave their samples an extra hit of fun. There's the entire Danger Mouse/Jay-Z mashup The Grey Album, of course, but I'm thinking of smaller details. When Ringo Starr's solo from ""The End"" appears early here I go immediately to Jason Forrest's ""Ten Amazing Years"", not Abbey Road. The swirl of strings from ""Good Night"" stitched here to Ringo's ""Octopus's Garden"" brings to mind Ekkehard Ehlers' drawn-out loop of the same phrase that comprises the entirety of one side of ""Ekkehard Ehlers Plays John Cassavetes"". Having all the mixes band-sanctioned loses a little something. Paul McCartney is said to have heard Love and remarked that he wished it went a bit further out. And it's hard not to agree, especially for people used to hearing mash-ups and guerilla sonic deconstruction via laptop. How badly do you want Yamatsuka Eye to do a Rebore Vol. 0 on this material? Really, the mashed-up bits here are just a seasoning, the occasional jarring effect to remind us that we're not just sitting around listening to Beatles records. Who knew that the backing track for ""Drive My Car"" fit perfectly over verses from ""The Word"" and ""What You're Doing""? The a capella ""Sun King"" sounds great backward on ""Gnik Nus"" leading beautifully into ""Something"" and doesn't contain any hidden messages beyond the one conveyed by the opening ""Because""-- that the Beatles were great singers. ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" seems a natural soundtrack for tumbling acrobats, and the coda to ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" sounds like it was made for this project. As the album wears on, the songs get ""bigger"" and are also made to stand on their own, without the mix trickery. But they also suffer from truncation. It's great to hear a round of the ""Hey Jude""'s epic chorus with just voice and drums, but the song means so much less at four minutes than it does at seven, with a full verse cut and the final fade happening earlier. I will say that hearing it pulled apart finally confirms that Beta Band's ""Dry the Rain"" steals from it almost completely, one instrument after another. It seems impossible to follow the final chord of ""A Day in the Life"", but the Martins are just closing the door on the darker, artier aspect of the Beatles, letting the uplifting pop band carry the day during the album's final section. The trimmed ""Hey Jude"", the reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (let's face it-- not great, but included because of all the showbiz connotations) and then closing with ""All You Need Is Love"". What seems to consume people most about this record is the sound of the thing, just how beautifully the original material was recorded and how great it comes over on a purely sonic level. The art of recording a rock band, it seems, reached its zenith in the late 1960s. In terms of capturing guitar, bass, drums, and voice, nothing since-- no matter how many tracks-- sounds as pure and lovely as what the Beatles did at Abbey Road studios. Love is turning everyone into an audiophile, then, which means it's making younger people a little older. And it's also a mashup remix, which means it's making older people a little younger. They were just a pop band, yes, but if anyone can bring all these music fans together under one tent, it's the Beatles. Which is what Love is ultimately all about.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9669-love/,Capitol,2006.0
371,2Pac,Pac's Life,Rap,4.1,November 28 2006,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"There's a moment near the end of ""Playa Cardz Right (Male)""-- one of 13 ""new"" songs on Pac's Life-- where Tupac Shakur has a conversation with Ludacris. Luda rose to fame years after Shakur was murdered, and the two probably never met, but there they are on wax, giggling banalities about their friends. It's not a real conversation, of course. Years ago, Tupac was just finishing off a track with a minute or so of adlibs, so Ludacris is just responding to the stuff Pac has already said, putting all his acting skills to work so that it can sound like these two guys were in the same room together at some point. The effect is weirdly asskissy, like Tupac couldn't give a shit what Ludacris has to say, like he just goes on talking anyway without bothering to acknowledge the guy constantly agreeing with him. Tupac: ""Castro is a straight gorilla pimp."" Ludacris: ""Yeah, my homeboy I20's the same way, man!"" Pac's Life is the sixth posthumous 2Pac album, not counting soundtracks or reissues or greatest hits albums. He's been dead for 10 years, and he's released more albums since his death than he put out when he was alive. That means the enormous well of unreleased material he left behind has been pretty well drained, and we're not going to learn much about him from new records. Instead, these albums might tell us a thing or two about the rap landscape into which they're being released. Plenty of the contributors to Pac's Life are too young to have had any meaningful contact with Tupac during his lifetime, and when they show up on the same track as the man, they're paying tribute. Rappers who depict themselves as kings of the world suddenly become bubbly sycophants. After all, none of them can ever hope to get anywhere near the levels of credibility as someone who died at the age of 25, who was riddled with bullets more than once before dying, who shot two police officers and didn't do any time for it, who declared war on an entire coast, whose 73 million records sold make him the biggest-selling rapper of all time. None of Tupac's posthumous collaborators can compete with him, so they just compare themselves to him. On the title track, T.I. Says, ""Lived by the same rules, so minus the tattoos/ We the same sort of dude with the same short fuse."" For T.I., that's humility. But Pac's Life doesn't exactly pay tribute to the actual life of Tupac Shakur. It's about the legend of the unrepentant thug who was too uncontainable to live. The problem is that that legend is way less interesting than the actual life of Tupac Shakur, someone who studied Shakespeare as a child before running away from home, who rocked a bathrobe and a shower cap onstage as a backup dancer for Digital Underground, who wrote moving tributes to pregnant teenagers when he wasn't rapping about murdering their brothers. Tupac contained multitudes, and he gleefully contradicted himself at every turn. But Pac's Life presents an image of Tupac as nothing more than a grim-faced thug, and that's not really much of a tribute. Of course, even when he's barking nihilistic clichés, Tupac's voice is still a deep, heavy sneer, and it sounds great over Swizz Beatz' thundering drums and sputtering guitars on ""Untouchable (Swizz Beatz Remix)"". But most of the tracks on Pac's Life are low-budget synth-preset bullshit, like LT Hutton's treacly synth fluff on the title track or Sha Money XL's tinkling quiet-storm pianos on ""Playa Cardz Right (Male)"". The guest-spots haven't been chosen with much care, either; we get an inexplicable grab-bag of superstars (Luda, T.I., Snoop Dogg) and nobodies (Nipsey Hussle, Jay Rock). Tha Outlawz, Pac's group of protégés, show up more than once, and that might confer some sort of legitimacy on the project, but they're still a shitty group of rappers. To say that Tupac himself is the best thing about these tracks isn't to pay him a huge compliment. It's sort of fun to predict who might sound fit to hold a track with the man (Young Buck) and who won't (Chamillionaire), but that's not enough of a reason for this mess to exist. Pac's Life is just another cash-in, the latest in a long line.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9663-pacs-life/,"Interscope,Amaru",2006.0
372,Snoop Dogg,Tha Blue Carpet Treatment,Rap,7.5,November 21 2006,Sean Fennessey,Contributor,"As hip-hop and its titanic artists age, there's much hand-wringing over how to do so gracefully. Jay-Z has become a stuffed shirt basking in his wealth, resembling a bourgeois uncle. Nas curdles as the days pass. Dr. Dre retreats like a sneering Sly Stone. Snoop Dogg, unlike his contemporaries, never compels a hand-wring. He is as he's always been-- buoyant, lazy, mischievous, misogynistic-- with a voice that's nearly tactile and a disposition that begs for anything but keen attention. Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, his ninth album, has been hailed a stirring return to the form he presented on his debut Doggystyle-- a somewhat overemphasized idea, but understandable in a year that likely won't be remembered as a special one for rap music. What the album actually does is present a calming looseness-- nothing shocking or obscure, and better for it. Pop it in and clean your bathroom. Or go for a run. Or bring it to a party. Or the strip club. Snoop Dogg is too culturally ubiquitous (lest we mention the abhorrent endurance of 'izzle' jokes) to scoff at pop, but there was an interesting moment at this year's MTV Video Music Awards. As the Pussycat Dolls accepted their award for Dance Video of the Year for ""Buttons"", they thanked Snoop for his contribution to the song, an indolent verse. The camera panned to Snoop as lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger cooed his name. Snoop responded by paying her no mind, scowling in the opposite direction as though someone had openly thanked Pol Pot. An amusingly awkward moment, certainly, but also a sort of turning point for him. Tha Blue Carpet Treatment is not so much a rejection of pop, as a conscious move towards integrating gangsta tropes with the accessibility of collaborators like R. Kelly and Akon afford. Snoop rarely says anything of note in his rhymes-- he is the truest all form-no content MC of his era. But there are moments here where the form is so impeccable that the absence of ideas is almost a positive. ""Think About It"", a smooth bit of L.A. sunshine soul, crackles with meticulous delivery. To wit: ""Incredible, forgettable, better blast past the mood of mine/ Many men were eradicated by music mine/ Open your eyes and take your time to visualize/ And once you decide to move your mind in due time/ It's so erotic you been exotic it's gettin' naughty/ Freeze and groove you're rowdy, rowdy girl, move your body/ It's melodic I'm being honest and modest/ You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it."" Those rhymes are vacant, but so captivatingly delivered, we can't help but be drawn in. The assemblage of collaborators here is obvious at times, inspired in others: longtime associate Nate Dogg croons on the indelibly funky Fredwreck-produced ""Crazy"", Kurupt snarls on two tracks, and the Game delivers one of his harshest verses of the year on ""Gangbangin' 101"". The vicious Timbaland production ""Get a Light"" features a combustible chorus from Damian Marley while the downy ""That's That"" is one of the smoothest R. Kelly team-ups in a long time. Because Snoop has so little to offer thematically and intellectually, it's a relief he's chosen the perfect collaborators at almost every turn-- B-Real, Akon, and the Prince Paul-backed Nine Inch Dix all body their guest spots, too. Most bandied about is ""Imagine"", a rare reunion of Snoop and his mentor Dr. Dre, not to mention the brief resurrection of wounded-wing soul man D'Angelo, who sings (warbles?) the chorus. Dre opens the song-- a lounge room piano tumbles down, hard snares clap, orchestral flashes ooze elegance-- wondering what might have happened if Biggie and Pac lived, if Russell Simmons never became a world-beating entrepreneur, if there were no hip-hop. It's a classy affair with an obvious conceit (Imagine if there were dragons and elves, too!) but feels earned coming from Dre and Snoop. This is the kind of nostalgia-baiting maturity 35-year-old MCs should be making. Of course, like any Snoop Dogg album since Tha Doggfather, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment is far too long, with an intro and 20 full-length tracks. Because Snoop is often without substance, our impulse is to reward him for doing something... anything. But this is exactly what he has done over the last ten years. Some albums are worse than others, but you can count on at least six superb pop songs. Here that ratio is higher, even if the aspirations aren't.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9642-tha-blue-carpet-treatment/,Geffen,2006.0
373,The Clash,The Singles,Rock,8.0,November 20 2006,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"This box set duplicates down to the smallest detail the singles the Clash released in the UK. It includes 19 CDs-- each packaged in its own sleeve, replicating the design of the original 7""-- all the attendant B-sides, 12"" mixes, and promo-only cuts associated with each release. The CDs are even black with faux grooves and each has a little label at the center of the disc to make it look like a 45. These little things are adorable. There's also a fat booklet containing mini-essays about each of the singles. The liner notes, most by musicians-- people like the Edge, Shane McGowan, Pete Townshend, and Bobby Gillespie-- explain just how much impact a single could have in those days. These fans talk about when the single was released, where they bought it, what it felt like to hold it in their hands, and how they spent the following however many months playing it incessantly. So the set, given its format and the slant of its liners, tries to give a taste of what it meant to be following the Clash when they were vital and when they made statements a song at a time. If you want this set, you either hope to re-live that era of picking up the new Clash 45s at they hit the shops-- you were there-- or you want to imagine you did. The music is almost uniformly fantastic. The Clash have aged very well, and their appeal now is probably broader than ever. But they were always a big-tent kind of band. I was never an anglophile, and I was never even remotely a punk, but growing up I could still dig the Clash. They were always the most inclusive of punk bands, respected by the hardcore scenesters but equally by the dabblers who saw them as one band among many. They achieved such democratic appeal in part because of the Beatles-like songwriting tension between the late Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, and in part because they never stayed any one place for long. Strummer was the heart and soul of the band, but Jones tempered Strummer's bellow, softening and broadening the band's sound and appeal. Throw in strong musicianship all the way around, lyrics that never took the easy path to getting their point across, and an insatiable curiosity and you get a band that deserves to be called among the best of the rock era. The growth the Clash show across these 19 singles is stunning, from the rough-but-tuneful punk of ""White Riot"", ""1977"", and ""Clash City Rockers"" through the unbelievably catchy ""White Man (In Hammersmith Palais)"", which set forever the template for punk bands dabbling in reggae, and on through dub, downtown disco, and hip-hop. If a form of pop music was cool at some point during the late 70s and early 80s, the Clash tried it. The super-extended single ""The Magnificent Seven"" -- eight tracks long on CD here-- is like a great mini album on its own, with various dance mixes of the title track, along with a few dubs of the reggae tune ""One More Time"". That such a politically oriented band that began with such an abrasive punk rock sound could eventually sign-off on the dainty bongo-led funk of these ""Magnificent Seven"" remixes is inspiring. And yet, despite how fantastic the music is and how ace the presentation is all the way around, there's something a little odd about this set. To package these items in 19 discs, in 19 sleeves, in two layers of a box, seems a bit strange when you're talking about a band like the Clash, a practical outfit always concerned with economy. They released a double album and then a triple in the early 80s, but they made sure their record company charged single-album prices for each. This thing is retailing for upwards of $75. Not to mention the format of two, three, four songs pre disc. Who wants to have to put on three or four CDs to hear a half hour of music? So Singles, obviously, is a specialists' item. The Clash have been repackaged every which way-- even while they were still an active unit-- so the presence of all this music in one place isn't in itself a revelation. But The Singles is an enjoyable celebration of a by-gone era when one 7"" piece of plastic could sit at the center of a world. I'm the oldest Pitchfork writer, and this era even pre-dates me. Still, reading the testimonials, seeing the sleeves, and hearing the music, it all seems like a crazy amount of fun. But you'll need some scratch to get this set and see how it all went down.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9640-the-singles/,Sony,2006.0
374,Johnny Cash,At San Quentin [Legacy Edition],Folk/Country,7.7,November 13 2006,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"The California State Penitentiary at San Quentin is California's oldest prison, built by inmates and completed in 1852. Current prisoners include serial killers, child murderers, child rapists, kidnappers, and torturers; it is the only jail in California with an active death row. In 1969, Johnny Cash staged a live concert at San Quentin-- the previous year, Cash's recorded performance at Folsom Prison in Sacramento County had lasted 39 weeks on the Billboard chart, becoming his best-selling LP to date. At San Quentin outsold its predecessor, perching at the top of the chart for four consecutive weeks. The original LP featured 10 songs (edited for sequencing), a 2000 reissue offered 18 tracks, and now Legacy's 3xCD set houses all 31-- 13 of which were previously unavailable-- along with a British television documentary originally aired in 1969. Clearly, singing in prison is a veritable franchise. Cash's decision to strum up a jail probably had as much to do with his own burgeoning mythology-- the Man in Black, the cold-blooded killer, the anti-Nashville rebel-- than any desire to remedy the U.S. prison system (although Cash did eventually actively advocate prison reform, meeting with President Richard Nixon in July 1972). All the ethical snafus inherent to the deed-- it's easy to argue that Cash exploited the convicts' plight to buoy his own rep, or to sympathize with the families of the prisoners' victims, who might not want to see their loved ones' killer clapping his hands to ""A Boy Named Sue""-- are hard to dismiss, but At San Quentin is still a spectacular musical performance, one of the most mesmerizing live records in American history. Some of the most notable new additions are the openers, which, for obvious reasons, weren't included on the original Cash LP or its reissue: Carl Perkins performs his own ""Blue Suede Shoes"" to warm up the crowd, complete with a rollicking electric guitar solo. Perkins is followed by Virginia's Statler Brothers (their ""Flowers on the Wall"" was immortalized in Pulp Fiction, and gets a rousing reception here). A late-incarnation of the Carter Family (now Helen, June, Anita, and Mother Maybelle) coo, warble, and Carter-scratch through ""The Last Thing on My Mind"" and ""Wildwood Flower"" before Cash finally strides onstage. Most of Cash's performance is familiar by now, but a medley of murder ballad ""The Long Black Veil"" and ""Give My Love to Rose"" is engrossing, and his ""Orange Blossom Special"", weirdly excluded from the other releases, is riddled with questionable double-harmonica and breathless asides. The 1969 Granada Television documentary, narrated by a (now half-garbled) British voice, eschews typical docu-trappings, avoiding talking crit-heads and shot/voiceover pairings for multi-camera concert footage and an interesting (if brief) meditation on Cash's role as the archetypal western hero: a killer, a savior, and an outlaw. Or, the kind of musician who plays jails, inadvertently glorifying the warm glow of incarceration and making prison look a little bit more fun (plenty in the San Quentin audience are wearing sunglasses, smoking cigars, sneering at the camera, clapping and nodding their heads to Cash's clipped strums). Audience members are interviewed by the crew, probably to humanize their plight, but we get more talk about personal heroes (and not being able to fight for their country and how they miss their wives and how it's actually society's fault that they're all convicts) than any frank admissions of guilt (or details of their respective crimes). June Carter, whose charm and verve remain intact, tries her best to look complicit, but something in her physical presence-- fidgeting, smiling too much and too big, sneaking sideways glances at Johnny-- seems to indicate general discomfort with the entire endeavor. Cash is accompanied, as usual, by the Tennessee Three, and his performance is jovial-- he jokes with the convicts, snickering ""You're in the wrong place to bend over, don't you know it?""-- and clearly propelled by the audience's adulation. The Legacy Edition is the most comprehensive document of Cash's night at San Quentin, and offers the most authentic portrait of the performance-- from the opening acts through the closing medley, the songs are presented chronologically. As confounding as it is that it took thirty-seven years for an unabridged release, this version of At San Quentin is a satisfying documentation of a still-questionable project.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9618-at-san-quentin-legacy-edition/,Columbia Legacy,2006.0
375,The Killers,Sam's Town,Rock,5.9,October 5 2006,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"Rock music in the 21st century has been subject to an unprecedented emotional arms race of Cold War proportions. Displaced from its traditional role of party music by dance and hip-hop, rock has focused more than ever on introspection, aiming for resonant feelings rather than escapist fun. Hence, pop-punk has given way to emo, hard rock acts dust off the power ballad to get airplay, and groups like Coldplay and Green Day fill stadiums with soul-searching anthems. It's only natural that the emotional ante would be rapidly rising, until it reaches the climax of triggering arena-rock's nuclear option: The Boss. The Killers would seem unlikely participants in the battle to protect The Great American Rock Song, having drawn more comparisons to Duran Duran than Bob Seger on their awkwardly-titled debut Hot Fuss. But for all the band's synth-pop dressings, their greatest success, both artistically and commercially, was with ""Mr. Brightside"", a woe-is-me epic that skillfully deployed the group's flimsy new-wave organ to shift the song into a second gear of cinematic sorrow. No dummies, the Killers choose to stay on the horse that got them to the A-list with Sam's Town, spending an entire album looking to build on that track's unabashed glory and so drafting as their muse someone who knows a bit about glory, one Bruce Springsteen. It's worth noting that the Killers aren't the only contemporary artist to recently start drawing inspiration from Jersey's poet laureate, with everyone from Destroyer to the Hold Steady making like they're the E Street Band this year. Springsteen may seem like a weird indie-fluence, but given his talents for transforming the passions and struggles of the common people into earnest vocal-cord-splitting rock mythology, it all makes sense. Just take a listen to the young man's melodrama of ""Born to Run"" without the ""Greatest Song Ever"" baggage it has accumulated, and wonder why Springsteen wasn't ordained as the patron saint of emo years ago. However, emulating The Boss isn't as easy as hiring a sax player and tying a bandana to your head-- and missing the mark by mistaking Springsteen's broadness for simplicity can lead a band toward an ill-advised and pretentious flop. On Sam's Town, the Killers attempt to incorporate several components of the Springsteen formula: super-sizing their guitar sound, creating fictional characters to externalize their angst, singing boldface banner statements in an impassioned vibrato. Most tellingly, the band's willingness to flirt with ambition is so daring that they include an ""Enterlude"" and an ""Exitlude"", bookends that aspire to set these songs within a setting that may or may not be based on the Vegas townie casino of the album's title. When the Killers hit their mark, they create refreshingly huge rock, the sound of a band unashamed of their success; when they miss, it's testimony that the right ingredients don't always create the same dish. Both of these outcomes are simultaneously present in lead single ""When You Were Young"", which successfully inherits the thrilling synthesizer peaks of ""Mr. Brightside"" while tripping over the ""Thunder Road""-aping refrain ""he doesn't look a thing like Jesus,""-- clumsy, second-hand religious imagery masquerading as lyrical depth. Over and over again, the Killers get the medium mostly right (the sledgehammer chords of ""This River Is Wild"", the canned-string crescendos of the title track), but whiff on the message, too often resorting to Cliff-Note Americana like highways and rivers or cartoonish character studies like the addict protagonist of ""Uncle Johnny"". The easy target for these near-misses is the madeover Brandon Flowers, though the Killers' new image means he's faced with the difficult task of shifting abruptly from his Robert Smith nasal-whine to Springsteenish bellow. For instance, quiet moments, like the bridge of ""When You Were Young"" or the outro to ""This River Is Wild"", reveal the heretofore unknown fact that aiming for Springsteen and missing even slightly results in Meat Loaf. Not that Flowers' bandmates help out any, as a key element of the arena-rock epic, awesome fucking fist-pumping backing vocals, are bungled at every opportunity, from the awkward ""I SEE LONDON, I SEE SAM'S TOWN"" of the opening track to the faux-Queen (""multi-tracking is hard, what if we all just sing in unison?"") of ""Bones"". Other places indicate that the band may have just gone for the wrong rock-icon; the reverb-chirp ""higher and higher"" peak of (seriously) ""Bling (Confessions of a King)"" indicates that the Killers are more successful impressionists of Achtung Baby-era U2. Perhaps it's that the comparatively vague platitudes of Bono fit the Killers more snugly than Springsteen's folk-based specificities, approaching the epic from a universal top-down rather than blowing up life's small moments into monuments (something the Hold Steady album, released on the same day as Sam's Town, gets more consistently right). Not fully realizing where their strengths and weaknesses lie makes Sam's Town, despite the drastic makeover, roughly equivalent to Hot Fuss, a mediocre album surrounding a few towering singles.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9484-sams-town/,Island,2006.0
376,My Morning Jacket,Okonokos,Rock,7.2,September 26 2006,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Reportedly, My Morning Jacket hate being labeled Southern rock. Who can blame them? Their ambitions transcend genre tags, and besides, Louisville, the band's hometown, is located in Northern Kentucky and is arguably more Midwestern than Southern. So it can't be a coincidence that for their first-ever live album, curiously called Okonokos, My Morning Jacket chose to record their performance at classic-rock homestead the Fillmore West in San Francisco, about as far west as you can get from Kentucky without getting wet. Their aim seems to be to prove that their brand of rural classic rock, abandoned-silo reverb, and farmyard psychedelia can connect anywhere across the U.S. If they're trying to avoid the Southern rock tag, what are they striving for? Okonokos shows the band trying to find out. Z positioned them as one of few contemporary bands that could appeal to a broad swath of the populace, from indie kids to frat boys to soccer moms to older listeners wondering why they don't make 'em like Led Zeppelin IV anymore. On stage, MMJ shed their regional associations and their signature reverb, but they're still an American band, reinventing classic rock as a bluegrassroots movement. The Skynyrdisms remain, but My Morning Jacket have added Zep-heavy riffs, Springsteenian grandeur, Bonnaroo-ready jams, and breezy SoCal pop into the mix, while retaining an enigmatic presence reminiscent of earliest R.E.M. So the music on Okonokos never sounds vague or really even placeless, but instead has a jolt of fresh energy. The current lineup may be the band's best and most dynamic yet: disciplined enough to love the sound of every instrument clicking into place, as on ""One Big Holiday"", but also restless enough to keep the songs constantly shifting. The grandiose ""It Beats 4 U"" launches into its strange whistling bridge (reminiscent of Goldfrapp'sFelt Mountain) before closing out with Patrick Hallahan's driving snare-led groove. It's a pretty neat sequence, but never feels showy or disconnected. Similarly, the reggae strut of ""Off the Record"" dissipates into a long, moody outro that swirls around the stageset flora, sounding looser and less directed than the studio version, as if the band made that transition on a collective whim. My Morning Jacket's move away from a regional sound has been gradually progressing from the rural sounds of At Dawn and The Tennessee Fire-- with their jumbles of guitar, banjo, harmonica, and reverb-- to the noodlier It Still Moves and the more electric, eclectic Z. So it's no surprise that the older material on Okonokos sounds most revitalized since it must be updated most dramatically to fit the band's increasingly expansive sound. Standouts ""The Way That He Sings"", ""Xmas Curtain"", and ""Lowdown"" are chirpy and bright without their original reverb. And nothing else on these two discs beats ""O Is the One That Is Real"" for its fierce rock assault, with singer Jim James' best performance of the evening propelled by Hallahan's slicing high hat and Bo Koster's noirish keyboards. Nevertheless, Okonokos still feels strangely unfulfilling, never quite living up to My Morning Jacket's reputation as one of the best live acts around. James botches the big moment on opener ""Wordless Chorus"", overselling those climactic yawps so they come out like out-of-tune brays. ""Runthru"" has an enormous riff that works well in this setting, but that theatrical grandeur, as well as the explosion of distortion, only underscores how silly the song is: ""Oh shit run,"" James sings, with complete seriousness, ""oh shit run through the ghetto."" ""Gideon"" jams aimlessly, and ""Mahgeeta"" never seems to end. Any live show will inevitably have crests and valleys, but besides these specific performances, Okonokos disappoints on a more general level: It too seldom sounds like an actual live album. There's almost no interaction between the performers and their audience: James never addresses the crowd and crowd noise is mostly inaudible except during the intervals between songs. Furthermore, the set list favors recent songs over older materials, which means there are fewer opportunities for dramatic reinterpretations. Aside from a few moments when they achieve a barreling momentum or hit a particularly tight groove, My Morning Jacket follow the prescribed routes set by the studio versions, sounding occasionally more intense but too often predictable in their course. These are minor complaints, as that respectable rating attests, but taken together, these shortcomings prevent listeners from getting any real sense of who these musicians are individually and collectively beyond what they could have learned from listening to the studio albums.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9448-okonokos/,ATO,2006.0
377,The Black Keys,Magic Potion,Rock,6.0,September 11 2006,Jason Crock,,"The Black Keys were never meant to be classy. For one, they're from Akron, a city that's not quite East Coast or Midwestern and has vaguely smelled like burning tires every time I've driven through it. For another, they're playing blues-rock in 2006-- no irony, no kind of pretense to authority or being some new band of purists, just a blues-rock band. But even if their so-called ""raw"" panache had been recycled a few times over, they had the kind of songs (""10 a.m. Automatic"" chief among them) that demanded the car windows be cranked down and the volume knob twisted firmly to the right for anyone weaned on classic rock radio. Now signed to elegant major-label imprint Nonesuch, their set up remains the same: one guitar and a set of drums. Singer/guitarist Dan Auerbach plays these unadorned riffs like the guitar was a harp, like their blues pillaging was a stately and noble pursuit, and these familiar riffs should be admired in and of themselves like museum pieces. I didn't expect to hear a 13-piece orchestra on Magic Potion, but nor did I expect to hear such a dry, austere record after the warmth of Rubber Factory. They whip up everything they can between just the two of them, Auerbach and drummer Pat Carney, but what they work up this time isn't a sweat-- it's restraint. On Magic Potion, the pleasures are coyer and the variations much more subtle from riff to riff, song to song. In other words, it's not the record I want to hear from the Black Keys. There are few attempts to push the two-man band into newer territory, but those that do aren't necessarily welcome. ""Strange Desire"" is a worked-up staccato paean, leaning on cymbal tapping and heavy reverb like a ""No Pigeons""-style aggrandizing retort to the Kills' ""The Good Ones"", but squelches any of its novelty by rhyming ""fire"" with ""desire."" At the end of each verse. There are three verses. ""You're the One"" fares better, a slow honey drip of gorgeousness with some much-needed vocal doubling to further sweeten the deal, but it's not half as palatable as, say, ""The Lengths"" from Rubber Factory. There's very little spark to early sequenced numbers ""Your Touch"" or the ""Heartbreaker"" retread ""Just a Little Heat"", but the latter half of the album does slow down and start to smolder. The title track makes the most of its space as Carney pounds in all the right places, showing restraint without losing the track's pulse. ""The Flame"" is a molten slow jam, as is ""Goodbye Babylon"", a stop-start stutter that stretches its quiet tension over a tricky chorus riff that would be awkward in the hands of any other band. But as Magic Potion shows, it's difficult to sustain an entire album of that almost-but-not-quite letting loose (and being a two-instrument band obviously doesn't help). I'm not willing to rehash the argument over whether they have the right to play their sparse, occasionally unpredictable take on blues-- one of the most tired arguments there is-- because I couldn't care less whether they jacked their swagger from Muddy Waters, Led Zeppelin, or even White Stripes. They used to be a good time. They used to have songs. Magic Potion is a record where overwhelming competence meets measured restraint, but for me, sacrilege trumps sincerity, and I'd rather hear tuneful blasphemy than a tasteful snoozer of an album. Shit, give me Blueshammer any day.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9398-magic-potion/,Nonesuch,2006.0
378,The Beach Boys,Pet Sounds: 40th Anniversary,Rock,9.4,September 8 2006,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Oh come on, it's just Pet Sounds. Despite the fact that two or three generations of music fans will secretly believe you have no soul if you don't announce your allegiance to it, despite that you probably already own it (in some cases, two or three times over-- if I could only remember where I put my 24-carat gold CD version), or that you may even have written an article for Pitchfork years ago making fun of anyone who dared criticize it, well, that's no reason to feel any pressure to make sure it's displayed prominently for guests, or worry that you haven't met your monthly ""God Only Knows"" listening quota. Despite (or because of) the ""pressure"" to adopt pro-Pet Sounds stances in today's high-powered world of hanging out with your friends or staying home and getting high whilst listening to ""Let's Go Away for Awhile"", I'd wager most people are only too happy not to discuss the merits of the oft-oft-reported Beach Boys masterpiece. Certainly, regardless of what I write here, the impact and ""influence"" of the record will have been in turn hardly influenced at all. I can't even get my dad to talk about Pet Sounds anymore. This isn't so bad. Beyond my personal preference for the records immediately following Pet Sounds (1967's Smiley Smile to 1971's Surf's Up in particular), I'd argue the actual sound of much modern music purportedly influenced by the Beach Boys is closer in execution to what the band did in the wake of Pet Sounds (and for that matter, Smile). ""Influence"" is a loaded concept here, because there's no foolproof way to measure how someone might channel inspiration from a single record, Pet Sounds or otherwise; however, much more certain is the feeling that very few musicians are making active decisions to ""try to top Pet Sounds."" In this light, just as with other perennially lauded pop/rock records, Pet Sounds is as much tautology as musical document. (Interestingly, this also seems to have been Brian Wilson's attitude beginning in mid-1967.) Forty years after release, then, while the album's initially disappointing (at least to Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys) chart showing has been vindicated by a perpetual reservoir of new fans and adoring critics - not to mention still being commercially viable enough to support recent live productions and similarly perpetual ways of reissuing the music-- talking about the music, or how the music makes you feel isn't much easier than it was in 1966. Very famous people waste no time in offering testimonials to Pet Sounds' greatness, but (probably wisely) stick to short statements about how important the record was to them as artists and musicians, or just how beautiful its music is. Pet Sounds was made during the period in 1965-66 when Brian stopped touring with his band, preferring to stay home and work on tracks. His decision to work with lyricist Tony Asher for most of the songs freed him further to focus on music. This not only translated to backing tracks of considerably more nuance and subtlety than even Brian's recent apexes ""California Girls"" and the Beach Boys Today! LP, both from 1965, but similarly well-crafted chord progressions and choral arrangements. Almost predictably, as the deserved praise for the vocal arrangements may never wane, I've heard more fine things said about the instrumental tracks recently than any other aspect of the record. In any case, the technical achievements of the record (only given further support by the stereo issue of the record in the late 90s) have tended to overshadow the emotional and spiritual ones, at least in my lifetime. This anniversary issue of Pet Sounds, including both the mono and stereo version of the record, and a bonus DVD with several documentary features, surround sound mixes and promo clips, will be of immediate interest to longtime fans for obvious reasons (of which ""collecting"" isn't necessarily the least important). In particular, the ""Pet Stories"" feature, with recent interviews with Brian, Asher, session drummer and Beach Boy pal Hal Blaine, and even an illuminating cameo from Elvis Costello, sheds light not only on the original sessions and song origins, but on all concerned parties' attitudes about the music now. Also very cool is the footage of Brian and famed Beatles producer George Martin listening to the original tracks; at one point, Martin twists a few knobs and Brian is convinced heâ€™s finally perfected Pet Sounds! Also included in the set, of course, is the album; mono and stereo mixes of Pet Sounds, recapping the tracklist from the 1999 CD issue. The most famous songs-- ""God Only Knows"", ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"", ""Sloop John B"", ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"", ""Caroline No""-- are no less gorgeous than they have always been. The hymnal aspect of many of these songs seems no less pronounced, and the general air of deeply heartfelt love, graciousness and the uncertainty that any of it will be returned are still affecting to the point of distraction. Currently, there is a minor surge in support for the record's two instrumentals ""Let's Go Away for Awhile"" and the title track, though later efforts like ""Diamond Head"" and the quasi-instrumental ""Fall Breaks Into Winter"" (not to mention its parent track, ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow"" from the Smile sessions) seem both more idiosyncratic and intrinsically interesting to me. As it happens, Brian's instrumental arrangements for the album, while again justly praised (especially by other musicians), were related to concurrent productions by Juan Garcia Esquivel, Les Baxter, Martin Denny, and a host of other exotica producers, in both the kinds of instruments used, and the stylistic appropriation of, say, percussion and string instruments from other countries. In fact, Brian was the only one of these people not producing music in stereo at the time, which might explain why it took so long for bands (and not just the Stereolab kind) to borrow as much from his instrumental tracks as from his vocal ones, which cut through mono mixes much more effortlessly than the backing tracks. So, the unfair question is: Do you love Pet Sounds enough to buy it again? Before you answer, here's a fairer one: How often do you need help recalling the emotions Pet Sounds provokes inside you? If you haven't lived with the record day in and day out, chances are, it's still a pretty fresh experience, and I'd recommend this set with absolutely no reservations. However, if the music is practically family to you already, I'd say check out the DVD stuff when you can, keep your current version, and watch the album's effects wind and rewind their way through lives and cultures in the meantime.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9371-pet-sounds-40th-anniversary/,Capitol,2006.0
379,Beyoncé,B'Day,Pop/R&B,7.2,September 7 2006,Tim Finney,Contributor,"According to most reasonable criteria, Beyoncé's second album B'Day is a success, outpacing her solo debut Dangerously in Love. Here, Beyoncé delivers precisely what many listeners have always wanted from her: a short, tight, and energetic set that's heavy on upbeat numbers and funk affectations, and light on the balladry and melisma. Remaining in soul mama character throughout, her newfound expressiveness fits so hand-in-glove with Richcraft or Neptunes-style funk drum patterns and surging horns that even when she departs from this style sonically-- such as on the percussive, Diwali-esque jam ""Get Me Bodied"", or the stiffly blaring ""Upgrade U""-- the shift feels negligible, and you can still hear the ghosts of horn sections. Beyoncé's lyrics are also funnier and more idiosyncratic than ever: ""I can do for you what Martin did for the people,"" she boasts on ""Upgrade U""'s extreme makeover hard-sell, and I suspect she knows she's the only r&b singer who could deliver the line with a straight face. So far so good, but what prevents this from being the classic pop album the above would suggest is that, well, Beyoncé simply isn't making classic pop anymore. By resolving the criticisms of her earlier work (too strident, too deliberate, too driven) Beyoncé has weakened her perfect pop technique. B'Day lacks the precision with which her earlier hits were crafted-- the alluring poise of ""Baby Boy"" is nowhere in evidence, and the glittering impregnability of the great Destiny's Child singles feels even more distant. B'Day sounds like an entire album of third and fourth singles, which is still better than an album of filler, but in a genre so overwhelmingly defined by its hit singles, a ""Crazy in Love"" or a ""Baby Boy"" can punch above its weight-- the consistency of ""Déjà Vu"" in this regard becomes a double-edged sword. Most of all, though, Beyoncé just sounds too real here: It was her pitch-perfect plasticity which gave much of her earlier work its majestic aura, as if she had transcended ordinary goals in a narcissistic drive for perfection. Having voluntarily stepped down from her pedestal, she now struggles to inspire the same sense of awe: Her songs emote as intensely as before, but their emotions are all too human. Ironically perhaps, this switch delivers its biggest pay-off, and B'Day's best song, with the ballad-of-sorts ""Irreplaceable"". It's as if, having lost the Midas touch of gleaming pop perfection, Beyoncé has opened up the possibility of stumbling on brilliance by accident. ""You must not know 'bout me/ I can have another you in a minute/ Matter-fact he'll be here in a minute,"" she boasts to a swiftly exiting lover, in a hopelessly unconvincing attempt at callous indifference. Before, Beyoncé's approach to heartbreak was always literal, her voice and her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. ""Irreplaceable"" is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9378-bday/,Sony,2006.0
380,Prince,Ultimate Prince,"Pop/R&B,Rock",8.6,September 5 2006,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"The two-disc Ultimate is the third compilation to cover Prince's royal Warner Brothers years. Stretching from the 1979 release of his eponymous second album to the 1992 ""love symbol"" record, the collection follows in the footsteps of 1993's The Hits (two separately available CDs, also packaged with The B-Sides in a box set) and the skimpy single-disc collection The Very Best of Prince, which was lost in the shuffle upon release in mid-2001. It's nice to see this material given chronological treatment, given Hits' haphazard sequencing; Prince started out in a world of his own, but it was one quite different from the place he would occupy by the mid-80s. Early tracks like ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"", ""Uptown"", and ""Controversy"" (anything calling itself The Ultimate Prince should have also included ""When You Were Mine"") were lean and economical, getting by with spare instrumentation and deliciously cheesy synths. Then came the radical shift: When the opening hook of ""1999"" kicks in, you can almost feel the stagelights flaring and Prince's world flooding with color (mostly purple; some blue, magenta, and gold). The first shot fired in Prince's ruthless assault on the 80s pop charts, the song also began one of the most creative and productive runs in popular music history: From ""1999"" until the end of the decade, you could count on Prince to make the radio a lot better a couple times a year. Nearly all the big hits are included on Ultimate Prince, but one unusual decision is going to leave some listeners cold. While the first disc is filled with radio edits of singles (an exception is the 8:40 album version of ""Purple Rain""), a number of significant additions are included only on the second disc in extended dance remix form. So while ""Let's Go Crazy"", ""Pop Life, ""Kiss"", and others are present, none is shorter than six minutes, and ""Little Red Corvette"" alone runs well past eight. It's an unusual strategy, but one that works for the most part. Most of the remixes are by Prince himself, so the fact that ""Hot Thing"" and ""Raspberry Beret"", for example, are only available here in longer mixes doesn't diminish the set. It could be an issue for someone new to Prince who hasn't already committed the songs to memory, but for someone like me, who hasn't pulled out the old vinyl in a while, hearing these familiar songs get some modest tweaking is enjoyable. If the absence of ""When You Were Mine"" is the biggest complaint on Disc 1, worse is the lack of ""Erotic City"" on Disc 2: The seven-and-a-half minute-long classic would have been perfectly suited for the extended mixes disc, and indeed, seems like the best reason for such a collection to exist. What most comes to mind while revisiting these tracks is how Prince conquered the world with such a singular vision. His world of sex, love, sex, political commentary, and sex managed to seem universal, even as the person behind the music remained unknowable. His music brought out the freakier side in everybody, and his erotic obsessions-- for as much heat as he once took for them-- now seem surprisingly healthy, predicated on mutual pleasure created by equals. If I had a son and he was going to learn something about sex, he could do a lot worse than listening to Prince records. James McNew of Yo La Tengo named his 2001 Dump album of home-recorded Prince covers That Skinny Motherfucker With the High Voice?. The title was a reference to one of Prince's stranger 80s tracks, ""Bob George"" from The Black Album. The line jumps out because it was, one imagines, the gut reaction of a certain segment of listeners who first encountered this strange man. Rolling Stones fans who booed him offstage during his opening slot on the Still Life tour were booing ""that skinny motherfucker with the high voice"" (although they may have added ""in his bikini underwear and thigh-high stockings""). But the amazing thing about Prince is that he eventually won these people over, and just about everyone else, too. You'd never expect such a big-tent approach from a pop star this strange and mysterious. Imagine anyone who cares about music being unable to find least one track in the Prince oeuvre to love. He eventually reached almost everybody, and he did it by forcing us to see the world his way.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6480-ultimate-prince/,Rhino,2006.0
381,The Roots,Game Theory,Rap,7.7,August 31 2006,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"The way ?uestlove keeps telling it, that initial meeting with new boss Jay-Z sounds like a fully-hocked saliva rocket in the eye of every asshole who tried to force the Roots to compromise their status as studied hip-hop altar boys in pursuit of the bottom line. Like the tough-ass principal with a heart of platinum, it seems Mr. Def Jam was full of charity, spewing quotables like, ""Don't come to me playing a whole bunch of Clear Channel songs thinking I'm gonna be cool with it,"" and, my personal favorite, ""If y'all come here with snap music, I'm snapping y'all the fuck out of my audience."" So the Roots were sent off to make a Roots album...you know, that ""artsy shit."" For a band known for the occasional indulgence (the $300,000+ price tag to complete Phrenology's horrendously overwrought ""Break You Off"", a concert mentality that equates excruciating length with awesomeness), such a mandate could have birthed a freewheeling disaster tipsy on its own pretensions. Miraculously, art-hop's highest get concise on Game Theory-- cutting song lengths, spoken-word tedium, and call-and-response nonsense. Fourteen years deep, the Roots avoid the wild sonic tangents of yesteryear, zeroing in on a svelte, safe, and solid take on what we've come to expect from a Roots record. Light years away from the jazzy bap of their early days, the Roots continue to embrace their band-dom and musical acumen here, with studio guru ?uestlove tweaking with purpose; unlike the sometimes directionless experimentation of Phrenology and the preternatural smoothness of The Tipping Point, each sonic decision sounds measured and precise yet still alive and heaving. Beat-wise, the bounding throb at the center of ""Here I Come"" pumps hardest, with key-man Kamal striking futuristic synths while ?uest lays down an unrelenting boom that's rewarded with a fizzy solo outro. Wet drums return on doom-y ""In the Music"", adding grit alongside a horror movie bassline and simmering guitar-- clearly (and thankfully), Scott Storch is nowhere to be found. Pop music writer Chuck Eddy once described Bruce Springsteen as someone whose ""muse can't be separated from his ego; he's too palpably concerned with how he'll be documented in the history books"" and the same can be said about the Roots. They sometimes mistake experimentation with progress while preaching holier-than-thouisms to the choir. Both ""Take It There"", with its over the top piano melodrama and the listless ""Livin' in a New World"" falter, relying too heavily on questionable texture and knob tricks. Tellingly, though, they are also two of the album's shortest tracks. Whereas such noble risks were once epic, they're now miniaturized-- the Roots have learned from their mistakes. More than ever, the band uses its know-how skillfully, as on the stunning title track, which beefs up Sly Stone's early 1960s song ""Life of Fortune & Fame"". On the original, Stone all but predicts the paranoia and doubt he'd perfect with 1971's There's a Riot Goin' On. That album's claustrophobic murk is felt throughout Game Theory, and its musical moodiness is echoed by Black Thought, who unpeels himself ever so slightly while charging hard with anger and desperation. There's been much debate about Thought recently, spurred by recent critical drubbings deeming him dull and uncharismatic. Even ?uestlove chimed in on the Okayplayer message boards, dismissing the hate as a mere ""trend."" Such rationalizations can't hide the monotonous nonchalance of Thought's natural delivery or his often second-rate bread-and-butter battle rhymes. Though technically proficient, his passivity is the Roots' most noticeable handicap. Game Theory partially solves this problem with a healthy dose of guest shots from old friends Malik B (making a strong return as a non-member after being booted for drug dependence about six years ago) and Dice Raw, along with welcomed mixtape all-star and Philly native Peedi Peedi (aka Peedi Crakk) and newcomer Porn. All four are gifted with lively styles that juxtapose nicely with Thought's steady cadence. The two best vocal performances on the disc come courtesy of Dice, who annihilates ""Here I Come"" with a one-eye-open, nervy confessional, and Peedi, who shows off an uncharacteristically tender touch on the warm Illadeph ode ""Long Time"". Although he gets the dubious distinction of Least Googleable Rapper, Porn haunts with his unique sing/cry style on the hook for ""In the Music"". Indicative of the LP's troubleshooting nature, Thought is wisely relieved from most of the album's hooks, and he trades in his half-huff boasts for pinpoint post-Katrina polemics that deride Bush, the creaky state of American democracy and the urban drug trap as he plays modern black editorialist. The Public Enemy-inflected ""False Media"" finds him voicing Dubya as a multitasking evil empire unto himself (""Send our troops to get my paper/ Tell 'em stay away from them skyscrapers"") and it does an excellent job of summarizing five years of fear-heightening boogey-man hunting into a few tidy lines. ""Baby"", a loose, Jay Dee-esque highlight that serves as a superior sonic tribute to the late producer than the album's well-intentioned but sappy Dilla shout ""Can't Stop This"", has Thought sing-songing through hallucinatory tales of rape and lust-- it's the pitch-black flip to ""You Got Me"". The MC's anxious musings become overbearing and repetitive by the album's end, but his bravura bursts on ""Long Time"", where he tempers his dread with home-grown hope, and especially the convoluted drug-feud terror of ""Clock With No Hands"", show that getting past his aesthetic pitfalls is a worthy pursuit. When I interviewed ?uestlove earlier this year about the progress of Game Theory, he admitted that ""it's a challenge to not over think"" his band's work. Of course, the album is over thought-- it is a Roots album after all, and superfluous embellishments along with high-concept artwork and sequence second-guessing are part of the excitement. But now, the excess brainpower is mostly used to cover-up past blemishes en route to a streamlined product that die-hards can justly revel in. President Carter should be proud.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9364-game-theory/,Def Jam,2006.0
382,OutKast,Idlewild,Rap,6.7,August 21 2006,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Outkast have never made the same album twice, and each new one requires that you go to the mountain your own damn self. Most contemporary rap albums are indigestible because they’re too damn long, but Big Boi and Andre 3000's full-lengths require effort. Their handful of big pop moments aside, Outkast have never been about single-serving hooks. Even on their 1994 debut, Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik, these two dope boys in a Cadillac were bouncing along the smoothly paved roads of perfect G-funk, their rubbery verses racing toward the horizon, daring you to play catch-up. By the 2003 release of Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Big Boi and Dre had moved into separate bedrooms but kept eating breakfast together for the sake of the kids. On Idlewild, they’re once again sitting next to each other at soccer games, but this record is still the product of two brains contained in butting heads. It’s gotta stick in your craw when your farewell ends up your ticket to pop immortality and finally gets studio cats to greenlight the movie you’ve been sitting on for nearly a decade. Idlewild is the soundtrack to Outkast’s forthcoming film of the same name, which means a lot of it is only vaguely comprehensible for those of us who haven’t seen its parent flick (which, at this point, is all of us). Now, Purple Rain this isn’t. His own wilderness period makes us forgetful, but Prince was once one helluva fastidious editor, and when it came time for his film debut, he smartly yoked his most outre ideas to nine of his most indelible songs-- all clocking in at less than 45 minutes. Outkast-- or at least Andre-- prefers a P-Funk-like mess. But where P-funk floored the engine without fear of either the edge of the vinyl or a club’s operating hours, their motor was an endless stroke-stroke-stroke. But hip-hop’s compartmentalized three or four minutes don’t lend themselves to endless vamps. And so where The Love Below spluttered through an uncontrollable bout of creative diarrhea, Idlewild is overloaded with hooks and ideas stuffed into songs. Initially, it’s thrilling in the way that any spectacle is. You admire the creative largesse, and there’s no doubt a strong 12-song album here. But at 79 minutes, exhaustion sets in by the midway mark, and the whole of the album takes on the feeling of someone trying to cap a broken water main. “Too much inspiration,” Big Boi ad libs at the beginning of (the pretty great) “N2U”. No shit. The breakdown goes like this: The best tracks are the ones on which the two are performing together, like the 40-yard-line funk of “Morris Brown”. Opener “The Mighty O” marks the reunion-- both men finally rapping again on the same track-- but it never fully congeals. The second best tracks are the nominal Big Boi solo joints, bass-heavy struts like “N2U”, or “Peaches”, with its beat like a screen door slapping in the wind. And the least best are the ones on which Andre is alone in the studio-- when he decides to play the blues on “Idlewild Blue” it’s difficult not to wince. The album sputters hardest when it plays on the movie’s Depression-era setting, padded with charmless jump blues and hot jazz pastiches. I don’t say Big Boi’s tracks are better than Andre’s because they’re the most traditionally hip-hop; I say it because they’re more pleasurable, more memorable, and funkier. His lyrics are funnier and more biting than the hippie-funk simp drool Andre tends toward whenever he stops rapping, and even how he sounds is now more engaging. As happy as I am to hear Dre rapping at all, it’s undeniable that his time away from the mic has atrophied a natural skill that once outshined the competition before he could even vote. Meanwhile, the dips and dives of Big Boi’s booming voice just get more nimble with age. People who hate on Outkast haters get a lot of mileage out of the fallacy that people dislike the idea of two men attempting to poke day-glo exclamation points through the restrictive language of 21st century rap. Mostly I’m hating on the unfortunate degeneration of one of my favorite acts of all time. Even having to write a semi-negative Outkast review is sad for me. Frankly, I’d rather remove chunks of my forearms with a melon baller. Talk to you about the future of Outkast? The future of Outkast is either a break-up when Idlewild flops or, if it’s a success, a few more mixed bags. Now that they’ve purportedly made a whole movie that plays off the idea of their oil-and-water personalities and irreconcilable differences, it’s starting to feel like a shtick-- one that they’re actively pimping. Anyone hoping for the return of the spark that made their great stuff great is, sadly, as big a fool as the kid sitting up nights waiting for his folks to get back together.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9331-idlewild/,"Arista,La Face",2006.0
383,Depeche Mode,Speak & Spell,"Electronic,Rock",7.5,July 20 2006,Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,"These reissues-- of arguably the three most beloved records in Depeche Mode’s catalog-- come in a slightly baffling format. Each package contains one CD, for the remastered album, and one DVD, featuring a pointless 5.1 Surround Sound mix, a small handful of bonus tracks (playable only via DVD), and a 20-minute talking-head documentary on the making of the album and the corresponding period in the band’s career. The decision to include those documentaries seems telling, and it seems like a struggle to get at the one thing that reissues-- no matter how many B-sides or demos they throw at you-- can rarely capture: How and why a band in question seemed so very cool at the time. That turns out to be a big issue with Depeche Mode. These days, the sound of their older records seems less like a revelation and more like a given: The band’s vibe has evaporated out into America to the point where you can spot it in anything you want, whether it’s Linkin Park, Marilyn Manson, or Britney Spears. (Rather incredible, for a British group.) These days, their carefully crafted look has them resembling a failed Hungarian metal band and their reputation is just that of a big, respectable, slightly drama-queeny pop act-- idiosyncratic, maybe, but hardly that unusual. New listeners cannot expect to hear these albums quite the way their fans did at the time. What’s funny is how that affects each of these records differently. With 1990’s Violator, the band’s pop-crossover classic, it makes hardly any difference at all; the way most people think about and imagine Depeche Mode was built largely on this record. Interview subjects in the documentary have much to say about how “perfect” the album is, how neatly and naturally it matches the sounds and synths of “progressive technopop” with the kind of grand songwriting that can play to massive stadiums. And they’re right. Like any good crossover, this record needs no particular context to appreciate, and listening back through, one gets a sense of why: The battle they’re winning here, of giving electronic music the human feel of teenage anthems and power ballads, is the same one still being fought by any number of Germans; it’s not constrained by time. The dark and slinky soul of the record-- the sex or drama-queen poses, the mix of domineering threats and extreme tenderness-- don’t hurt either. But in carrying its context with it-- and in being somewhat critical to today’s pop-- Violator just stands as a moving, solid, record, a classic for the archives of popular music; it doesn’t so much carry a lot of the things that made Depeche Mode feel so much themselves. With 1987’s Music for the Masses, that stuff is all there-- which makes the music both harder to “get,” from today’s perspective, and also more interesting. The Depeche Mode of this album is the one that brought together a rabid audience of trendy coastal kids and middle-American teens who got beat up over stuff like this-- all of whom saw them not only as the peak of style, but as something positively revelatory, something speaking only to them (even in a crowded stadium), something alien and cool, disorientingly kinky, and entrancingly strange. For many, this was probably one of the first dance-pop acts they’d heard that didn’t seem to be entirely about being cool and having a good time; their music had been dark, clattery, and full of S&M hints and blasphemy, and on this record it reached a level of Baroque pseudo-classical grandness (see depressed-teenager shout-out “Little Fifteen”) that lived up to those kids’ inflated visions of the group. At the same time, though, this Depeche Mode could be fun, even in its minor keys: The go-to radio pick for this album was the version of “Behind the Wheel” that segued into a cover of “Route 66”. And it’s somewhere around that fact that we might recognize how far we are from the mainstream “alternative” audience of the late-80s, a scene we see in passing between the chatter of the documentary. Anyone looking to understand that context, or just infatuated by the guy in the front row of Depeche Mode’s Rose Bowl concert wearing a Fishbone t-shirt, would do well to look to Depeche Mode 101, D.A. Pennebaker’s tour film-- which, in a canny pre-""Real World"" move, spends time following a group of fans who’ve won a chance to follow the band on tour. With the band’s 1981 debut, the increasingly adorable Speak & Spell, our distance from the original context actually makes things better. Of course, this is not the Depeche Mode we know: The songs on this album were written by Vince Clarke, who would shortly after leave the group and find fame with Yaz and Erasure. And these, of course, are the early days of synth-pop: These songs are building-block simple, bleepy and discoid, and the band sounds as gawky and adolescent as Dave Gahan looked. There’s something terrific in hearing this from a distance, not as stylish futurism (not anymore) but as the happy noises of teenagers who believed it to be stylish futurism-- and with a charming earnestness. “Happy” because of, well, Vince Clarke, whose work with Erasure is a testament to both his love of joyous disco-pop and his ability to pack it full to bursting with emotion. The best tracks here (like the Kraftwerk-y “New Life” and the dancefloor standard “Just Can’t Get Enough”) are classics, and even the lesser ones-- packed as they are with hooks and verve-- can charm you giddy, in the same way it can charm you giddy to see Dave Gahan prancing around in a bow tie on ""Top of the Pops"" in the documentary: He looks so young! And shy! And they haven’t even started dressing like leather men yet! What’s funny is that these three records, despite being the obvious standouts for reissue, are some of the most vexed by this whole issue of context and aging. Violator can sound like a solid but not particularly interesting pop record; Music for the Masses seems to be reveling in an audience that’s less comprehensible now; and Speak & Spell is a lovely ""historical"" gem. Here’s hoping Rhino’s reissue series will be able to make its way further down into the catalog, to those records that aren’t so weirdly situated-- first-rate synth-pop like the songs on Construction Time Again and Some Great Reward, the ones that first developed that American cult around something that didn’t need much social explanation, and probably still doesn’t.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11881-speak-spell-music-for-the-masses-violator/,"Mute,Mute,Mute,Mute,Sire,Sire",1981.0
384,Johnny Cash,American V: A Hundred Highways,Folk/Country,7.8,July 6 2006,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Johnny Cash is dead, and now that the body is no longer with us, all that's left is the public myth: the larger-than-life love affair with his wife, June Carter Cash; the thundering voice, which will resound now only from speakers; the unshakeable moral authority that derived from his hard childhood, hard living, populist outlook, and eventually his old age; the neurodegeneration that made it impossible for him to play guitar on his last records; the inspiring determination to write and record even in his frail final days. And most of all, that black wardrobe, which he once told us symbolized, among so may other things, ""the poor and the beaten down/ Living in the hopeless hungry side of town."" Cash may be dead, but his ghost haunts us publicly. Perhaps more than any other album in the Rick Rubin-produced series, Cash's final work, American Recordings V: A Hundred Highways, tries to balance the man and the myth, addressing his life and career with a humor and a gravity that are unmistakably human and unmistakably Cash. Despite the fact that all but two of its tracks are covers, these dozen songs address his marriage to June, his determined Christianity, and his impending death with candor and insight. His covers of Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind"" and Hugh Moffatt's ""Rose of My Heart"" tenderly sum up the Cashs' loyalty more eloquently than any movie ever could, and ""On the 309"", the last song he wrote, is filled with wit and vigor. Cash also cracks jokes about his legacy on Don Gibson's ""A Legend in My Own Time"", finding it little more than meaningless as he prepares to meet his Maker. ""If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regret,"" he sings, ""I'd be a legend in my own time."" The album is also notable for what's missing. There are no abstractly religious songs like ""The Man Comes Around"" or ""Redemption"", nor any poorly chosen covers like ""Rusty Cage"" or ""The Mercy Seat"". A Hundred Highways may be the most consistent entry in the series, although perhaps not the most exciting or even the most enduring. But after the middling Solitary Man and The Man Comes Around, both of which failed to capture the vitality that made American Recordings and Unchained so engaging, A Hundred Highways sounds surprisingly good-- a final uptick in the series' downward trajectory. It's a satisfying and often moving final chapter to Cash's life and career, one that rejects self-pity and remorse in favor of hopefulness and even celebration. Rubin does insert some distracting production elements, like the ominous marching percussion that overwhelms Cash's vocals on ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"", but for the most part A Hundred Highways is bare-- just Cash and an acoustic guitar-- which makes it a nice complement to Personal File, a collection of recordings released earlier this year. The quality of Cash's singing fluctuates from song to song; he sounds positively youthful on Springsteen's ""Further on up the Road"" and sadly ravaged on ""Four Strong Winds"". But he makes better use of the wrinkles in his voice here than on The Man Comes Around, on which the quaver lent unearned gravity to several tracks. On the opening prayer, ""Help Me"", he exhaustedly exhales the word ""please"" in the chorus, letting us know what's at stake in these songs and in his life. Nothing else on this album-- or likely on any other release this year-- so effortlessly and evocatively suggests the helplessness of old age, the comfort of mortal resignation, or the finality of death than Cash's delivery of that simple word.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9179-american-v-a-hundred-highways/,"Lost Highway,American",2006.0
385,Dr. Dre,Death Row’s Greatest Hits: The Chronicles,Rap,8.5,June 29 2006,Sean Fennessey,Contributor,"Lavishing Andre Young with praise is like getting worked up over filet mignon. You're not going to impress anybody with description and deification. Dr. Dre didn't just reconfigure rap music with The Chronic, he played perhaps the largest role in making it the most viable form of American popular music this century. What's gotten lost in the writing of his legacy is the slight devolution his most successful period marked. As much as G-Funk set the post-80s generation ablaze-- sidling up to the table less than a year after Nirvana's Nevermind began dominating the consciousness-- it leaned too heavily on George Clinton's two-decade old cosmic slop. And for all of Snoop Doggy Dogg's liquid cool (anyone else miss that Doggy?), there was always Dre's hyper-clunky delivery. Still, there's no denying the immensely decadent, trunk-rattling pseudo-reality of his best Death Row-era output. This 15-song set is the second Dr. Dre compilation this decade, following 2002's similarly titled Chronicles: Best of the Works, and it struggles to match the comprehensive assemblage of 1996's Death Row Greatest Hits. This one, however, leans far more heavily on Snoop, eliciting four tracks from Doggystyle and one from the underestimated Tha Doggfather. Snoop's a cipher nowadays, awash in product placement's goop, but the armchair funk of ""Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)"" is as funny and flagrant as ever. Rank misogyny in hip-hop wasn't news at this point, but damn, did Nate Dogg take it to romantic extremes on that track. Elsewhere, ""Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')"" and Lady of Rage's ""Afro Puffs"" sound aggressive as ever, where Dre and the Lady spit invective over that signature West Coast ping and kicking-a-dead-body snare. The major hits, especially ""Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"", hold up, but the Leon Haywood-sampling skeleton reveals a song that rode to prominence on the strength of Snoop's elegant discourse (""But, uhh, back to the lecture at hand/ Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand"") more than originality of production. Still, Dre has mastered so many styles over the years, from N.W.A.'s soul-laced nihilism to Eminem's carnival-barking circus themes to 50 Cent's megalomaniacal street semantics to the ultra-sheen of Gwen Stefani r&b. His Death Row tracks are his most iconic, without question, but feel more about purpose and personality than sonic clarity. No one wants to rate Jesus' miracles, but I mean, c'mon, making the blind guy see was more meaningful than water-to-wine, wasn't it? Really, they're all gems, but two shine extra bright: Dre's reunion with Ice Cube, ""Natural Born Killaz"", actually foretold the chaotic slams of Dre's best album, the overwhelmingly precise 2001; and the 2Pac collaboration ""California Love (Remix)"" features the little-heard, nearly two-minute vocoder solo from Roger Troutman, one of Dre's forebears. The solo is chill-inducing, stretched out longer than it has to be, punctuating one of rap's most extravagant songs with a finale full of grandeur and, dare I say, gravitas. There are only a handful of songs here that even the most casual fan of rap-- nay, popular music-- won't own. But as a playlist, Chronicles lacks any thematic connotations. It certainly works as Gangsta Shit 101 and nudges everyone, again, about Death Row's frozen-in-time prominence. It also reminds listeners that the label didn't really have much going for it musically aside from Dre's (and later Dat Nigga Daz's) production. As Dre has aged and attempted to maintain his grasp on screw-faced gangsta lean, his output has taken a turn for the absent. It's been a struggle, as Dre the family man is clearly no longer Dre the ""I will kill Eazy-E if I see him in public"" thug. He may never have been. Take a peek at some pictures from his days in the electro-funk squad, the World Class Wreckin' Cru-- sometimes I wonder if he still tries on that shiny suit. So, as his long-rumored Detox angles with Chinese Democracy for most overhyped Neveruary arrival and heads get antsy, there will always be compilations like this to insist things are not like it was then.

386,The Black Keys,Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP,Rock,7.0,June 19 2006,Sean Fennessey,Contributor,"The Black Keys are now well beyond obvious blues-rock duo comparisons, having carved out three of the best head-in-the-past, riffs-in-the-future albums of the past decade. Before ditching the only home they'd known, blues staple Fat Possum, for the NPRarified air of Nonesuch, Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney threw together this fitting farewell, saluting deceased labelmate Junior Kimbrough. In the process, they avoid the hammy recreations that cover albums often bring: This is no Encomium or Radiodread, but rather an acknowledgement of a hero and a simple cap-tip. Working from the same modal electric blues that Kimbrough plied for decades, Black Keys take these songs and apply the swinging rollick and bended notes for which they've become known. Each track is a yearning, often flagellating ballad of sorts (titles: ""Have Mercy On Me"", ""Work Me"", ""My Mind Is Ramblin'"", etc.), and that's what Auerbach seems to have in common with Kimbrough-- a desperate wail coupled with subtly sophisticated guitar playing. But the songs sound completely different from the originals, sometimes distorting lyrical structure but mostly throwing a hazy, almost psychedelic trip onto what were once melodically downtuned blues arrangements. The Keys have covered Kimbrough twice before and each of those other approaches was more straightforward and amped. ""Do the Rump"", from their debut The Big Come Up, is pretty ferocious rawk stuff. The aching ""Meet Me in the City""-- perhaps Kimbrough's best ever-- is a nice contrast to some of the liberties they take elsewhere. For a guy who sired 36 kids and died with a common-law wife, Kimbrough seems pretty screwed romantically, yowling ""Please don't leave me right now, girl, right now, oh no..."" Like his inspiration, Auerbach sings in an unclear mumble that adds a lived-in weight to the music. The white-boy imitators from Ohio jacking a Mississippi Delta shaman's style is an idea fraught with unmanageable questions. The Black Keys, however, have been graceful and more than honoring in the past about their muses, so there doesn't seem to be a lot of culture-transmogrification, other than the occasional ripped-off riff. That much is testified to by Kimbrough's widow, Mildred, on the last track via answering machine, where she notes that Auerbach and Carney are ""the only ones that really really played like Junior played his records."" The track is a bit of a shameless pat-on-the-back to round out a classy six-song affair, but I doubt Kimbrough would have a hard time jamming with these two.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9005-chulahoma-the-songs-of-junior-kimbrough-ep/,Fat Possum,2006.0
387,Mobb Deep,Blood Money,Rap,4.6,June 12 2006,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"On paper, Mobb Deep's decision to sign to G-Unit wasn't all that insane. For one thing, it's not like they had anything else going on; the Queens duo peaked years ago, they hadn't been taken seriously since Jay-Z bashed them, and they were getting clumsier and more desperate every year. For another, the duo's stark, nihilistic early work was a pretty clear influence on fellow Queens native 50 Cent, whose Get Rich or Die Tryin' was the bleakest, most violent big-selling rap album since DMX debuted. The big difference between the two camps was always in surliness. For all his gun-talk, 50 Cent is an optimist at heart, and his good-natured sing-songy hooks have a goofy, self-satisfied warmth. Mobb Deep have never been warm or optimistic, and their wispily claustrophobic mid-90s output set new standards for bloody paranoia. For this to work, they'd have to find some happy medium between two fundamentally opposed dispositions. Mobb Deep only pull off that balance once, on ""Pearly Gates"", a sunny track by Exile. Over a gorgeously lilting gospel sample, 50 Cent stays happy and congenial even when he's rapping about how everyone wants him in prison and then delivering a perfect little chorus: ""Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good/ Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood."" Havoc has a nice verse about redemption and Prodigy, the Mobb's craggily hoarse frontman, changes everything with one about how he hates God; it's stunning in its vicious rage (""For leaving us out to dry in straight poverty/ For not showing me no signs they watching over me""). It's a great moment, but you wouldn't know it from Blood Money's commercial release. Some Interscope bean-counter decided the song was too volatile and blurred out all the fuck-God stuff, rendering a potentially powerful song toothless. The rest of the time, Prodigy sabotages himself, leaving behind his harsh gutter-speak for clubbed-up money-talk. That's not a bad thing in itself, but Mobb Deep can't pull off triumphant, and so their boasts sound empty and joyless, and their misogyny is mechanistic-- just as boring as it is objectionable. Worse, Havoc and Prodigy can barely ride their own beats anymore; they sound beaten-down and defeated. Blood Money works when the two look back to times when G-Unit money wasn't on the table, remembering themselves as poor Queens kids longing for dirtbikes on ""Daydreamin'"", talking about getting their first guns on ""The Infamous"". Musically, some of the tracks are breathtaking; on ""Click Click"" and ""Its Alright"", Havoc takes G-Unit club-rap and makes it harsh and queasy, signifiers of smoothness rubbing up against each other just wrong. And Prodigy can still be truly menacing when he offers chilling specificity: ""Gunpowder resi on the sleeve of my Pelle."" But too much of Blood Money represents something sad and fascinating-- two demons domesticated, two artists who have willfully transformed themselves into hucksters.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8989-blood-money/,"Interscope,G-Unit",2006.0
388,Johnny Cash,Personal File,Folk/Country,8.5,May 26 2006,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Posthumous releases prompt a kneejerk cynicism from many listeners. It's been only three years since Johnny Cash's death, and already we've seen a mythologizing Hollywood biopic, two versions of a sprawling four-disc box set, and a best-selling single-disc greatest-hits that tried in vain to squeeze a half-century career into 22 tracks. The Tupac'ing of the Man in Black stretches into the near future, with a fifth installment of his diminishing-returns American Recordings collaboration with Rick Rubin due in July. But for now, there's another posthumous chapter: the vault clearing. Personal File, the first new material released since Cash's death, is two discs' worth of unreleased tracks, mostly acoustic, dating as far back as the early 1970s. The story, which sounds like a legend so is probably true, is that Cash recorded them in his home studio and locked them in his vault. They were recorded ostensibly for his own pleasure or at least for family posterity, not necessarily for public consumption. They sound like he's talking not to himself, but to an audience. All in all, the release feels like a scrapbook of sorts: half entertainment, half autobiography in song. It's more than enough to dispel the aforementioned cynicism, which admittedly has more to do with marketing than music. Cash's commanding voice is in its prime, the setting is spare and intimate, and his song choice draws from hymns and hits to reveal a deep and complex inner life-- of course, it's great. Occasionally it does seem a little heavy-handed, but that might have more to do with the sequencing than the songs. Plus, Cash is a fine storyteller, introducing these tracks with reminiscences that reveal their roles in his life. He introduces ""Drink to Me With Thine Eyes"" with a story about singing it for a high school graduation ceremony: ""I guess this was when I was looking for myself. But I never forget that because it's one of my first public singing occasions. And I've sung this song mainly to myself ever since I was 17 years old because of those memories."" His conversational, unpolished performances keep the mood loose and often add levity to the proceedings. On the Louvin Brothers' ""When I Stop Dreaming"" he can't quite sustain the notes that they held so effortlessly, but the attempt is endearing. Midway through the hymn ""Have Thine Own Way Lord"", his voice booming low and grave, Cash stumbles over the tune and has to start again. Poking a bit of fun at himself-- how often has he sung this particular song?-- he jokes, ""Okay. 'Have Thine Own Way', take five."" Listening to Personal File feels like reading an artist's journal or an author's correspondence. These 49 songs reveal depths about Cash, although at times they seem almost too personal, as if they actually were never intended for a public audience. The first disc contains secular material: love songs and tour songs and covers and country laments. The second disc is entirely spiritual, including two back-to-back songs about Mary Magdalene-- ""If Jesus Ever Loved a Woman"" could be a Da Vinci Code tie-in. Given the solitary nature of the recording, this second disc sounds like a form of prayer and praise, as if the Man in Black is talking directly to the Man Upstairs. For Cash singing these songs became a form of worship, which makes this second disc undeniably moving. Still, the decision to separate the secular and the spiritual on Personal File seems a little disingenuous and misrepresentative. There's already been a collection of discs that categorized Cash's songs under the headings Love, God, Murder, and the vague addendum Life. That set worked because the distinctions were the point of the compilation, revealing the breadth of Cash's interests and output. On Personal File, this same distinction seems a little suspect: Anyone with a passing knowledge of Cash's career should surely realize that he did not keep his spiritual side separate from his work. His hard-won Christian faith played a crucial role in all of his songs, lending them a moral gravity. Conversely, his secular concerns lend his songs of praise a powerful conflicted quality, making them sound like the humble prayers of a repentant sinner. On Personal File, this separation restricts these songs and their meanings and melodies: Why wouldn't ""Have a Drink of Water"", about Jesus in Samaria, fit right alongside Cash's take on John Prine's ""Paradise""? Or ""The Engineer's Dying Child"" alongside ""My Children Walk in Truth""? What would this tell us about such a complex American figure? I recommend you shuffle the tracklist and find out for yourself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9052-personal-file/,Columbia,2006.0
389,Black Sabbath,Greatest Hits 1970-1978,"Metal,Rock",6.2,May 2 2006,David Raposa,Contributor,"There ought to be a law, or a commandment. Something like: Thou shalt not plucketh tracks from any Sabbath album past Sabotage when compiling a one-disc greatest hits collection, and thou shalt choose very carefully from both Sabotage and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, lest ye disenfranchise Sabbath neophytes. After all, only dedicated spelunkers are going to want to venture into the depths plumbed by Black Dio and Black Purple and Tony Iommi's Traveling Sabbath of Ebon Darkness. If you want the best, then you want Ozzy Osborne cribbing notes from Hammer Studio horror flicks and/or his own experiences with various controlled substances. Rhino knew this back in 2002, when they compiled two discs' worth of Ozzy-era goodness. Twenty-nine total tracks; a mere four from the final two Ozzy albums, and only 10 from the latter half of Ozzy's tenure. On this greatest hits collection, the ratio's less favorable-- out of 16 total tracks, three are turds from the post-Sabotage era, plus one underwhelming track each from both Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage. Were I in an Old Testament mood, I'd simply draw the line at Vol. 4 and start turning heathens into salt. Such a demarcation means folks who bought this comp could cut bait with the awesome-beyond-words ""Supernaut"" and display their devil horns with pride. Tracks like the turgid ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" and ""Hole in the Sky"" sound like watered down Sabbath, especially following various Vol. 4 highlights. Which is a sight better than Sabbath doing their best Cheap Trick impersonation (""Never Say Die""), or Sabbath trying to one-up Blueshammer (as on ""Rock 'N' Roll Doctor"" and ""Dirty Women,"" both from the misnomered Technical Ecstasy). I guess listeners should be happy Rick Wakeman's contributions to the band's gradual decline or the group's foray into new-wave what-the-fuckness aren't included. Regardless of how the compilers try to ruin the party, there's no denying what Sabbath once was. From the first bell toll of ""Black Sabbath"" until ""Supernaut"" fades to black 11 tracks later, the band's greatness is unmistakable. Iommi must have brought a few extra virgins to the crossroads when he met up with old Lucifer, as the leads to songs like ""War Pigs"", ""Black Sabbath"", and ""Iron Man"" are inescapable and eternal. (That the compilers saw it fit to indiscriminately chop two minutes off of ""Iron Man"" is just another strike against this disc.) The group's Gothic interpretation of the blooze is all but perfected on the track which inspired their name. Iommi plays a few notes, Bill Ward crashes his cymbals, Ozzy offers some stanzas concerning devil worship, and cathedrals in fog emerge from the speakers. It's campy as hell, but they play it straight, and it works. Almost 40 years later, the music is still able to evoke this mood perfectly. Paranoid is the apotheosis of the Sabbath sound, as five minutes on any classic rock station will attest. And there's a very good reason for that-- tracks as played out as ""Iron Man"" and ""War Pigs"" still pack a punch, with the production lending the songs a cavernous feel that flatters the group's deceptively simple instrumentation. After that peak, the group refined their sound, which included both sublimely stupid rock stuff like ""Sweet Leaf"" and the mellotron-aided piano balladry of ""Changes"". And tracks like the unstoppable ""Supernaut"" and equally great ""Snowblind"" hold their own against other high points in the group's catalog. Blame the drugs or plain old sloth, but later attempts to expand the group's palate weren't nearly as successful. After Vol. 4, the band sounded less like Sabbath than like a group that either wanted to be Sabbath or be something else. Including back-to-back examples of this mediocrity to close out this retrospective is not the best way to end things. Of course, this compilation is hardly the best way to pay tribute to Black Sabbath. Those with any interest in checking this stuff out would be better served by either seeking out actual albums or spending the extra cash on the aforementioned two-disc collection of Sabbath's best.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/775-greatest-hits-1970-1978/,"Rhino,WEA",2006.0
390,Pearl Jam,Pearl Jam,Rock,5.5,May 2 2006,David Raposa,Contributor,"No, really-- this album is the return to form that Pearl Jam fans have been waiting for since Ten. Or Vs.. Or Vitalogy. Or whichever album was the last on which Pearl Jam were a fully accredited rock band. This eponymous effort-- the group's eighth studio full-length, and first for J Records-- is the most consistent effort the group's released since its second album. No pump organ-flecked spoken-word jags about insects, no meandering Eastern-tinged meditations on life, no songs about Jeff Ament's dog. Just 13 tracks of thoughtful, middle-aged, post-grunge rock'n'roll for the thoughtful, middle-aged, post-grunge fellow in all of us. But it gets pretty boring pretty damn quick. Think what you will of the group, but there's no denying their growth. Despite having the wide eyes of Alternative Nation turned toward them-- selling 17 million copies of their first two records-- Pearl Jam decided to take the road less traveled, and that seemed to make all the difference in maintaining the band's creative viability. Of course, this choice is where they broke with the lion's share of their fan base-- millions who bought into Pearl Jam's original MO weren't willing to put up with creative wanderlust. On Pearl Jam, that's what you get from start to finish (barring one accordion cameo in the minute long reprise of ""Life Wasted""). While there's no shirt-rending Jesus Christ poses to be had here, this is as close to the righteous bombast of their heyday as they're likely to ever get again, for better or worse. One thing that has returned, unfortunately: An emphasis on Eddie Vedder's voice, an acquired taste's acquired taste. That his mushmouthed mewling and moaning became the template for a slew of copycat chest-thumpers is the stuff that keeps vocal coaches up at night. The ""weird"" Pearl Jam albums found Vedder's singing improving ever so slightly, to the point that he was actually singing without any odd affectations-- the uh-huhs, the oooh-yeahs, the arghs. On this album, though, he's back to the multi-line mulching, growling for all he's worth through its more aggressive tracks. He often sounds best on the low-tempo songs, where the mood better complements his voice's strength-- Eddie's a crooner, not a wailer. But here, he even wails through the slower songs, killing ""Parachutes"" with his over-emoting and vamping unsuccessfully over the bluesy saunter of ""Come Back"". Granted, Pearl Jam haven't lost the perspective they've gained through age-- good luck trying to get their young selves to pen a Springsteenian working-class portrait like ""Unemployable"". Instead of trying to rage against the machine, they're appealing to its intellectual nature. Unfortunately, this nuance is steamrolled by the group's need for fan-friendly riffage. After years of trying to live up to one of their early statements-- ""there ain't gonna be any middle anymore""-- it's disappointing to find them steering the ship back toward the center.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6210-pearl-jam/,J,2006.0
391,The Beatles,"The Capitol Albums, Vol. 2",Rock,7.5,April 20 2006,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"I admit it. I was a little harsh on these guys the first time around. It's not that I hate the Beatles. However, in 2006, after Paul has finally had his way with Let It Be, we've been given three helpings of Anthology leftovers, half the band is dead, Bob Spitz's recent thousand-page Beatles biography moves the band a step closer to trumping Jesus' wordcount, and it appears we're starting to run out of bands obviously ripping them off, I'm a little tired of them. I grew up on this stuff, mind you; countless hours of propping my head up in front of my mom's old record player listening to worn copies of Abbey Road and the White Album, dialing 1-800-BEATLES in the blind hope that someone would answer (and they did: it was a Beatles Convention hotline), drawing pictures of fake bands who just happened to have an acoustic phase in the mid-60s. And I'm spent: the records are in my bones, so I'm rarely urged to play them. Thing is, for better or worse, the Beatles either invented or popularized almost every rock artist clichÃ©. The notion of bands having separate and distinct creative phases, of band members having different (but essential) roles and personalities, of wives being the villains, of the solo record being an ego trip, of clean, linear emotional/musical/spiritual progression-- maybe it didn't take the Beatles to let journalists and fans indulge in their obsessive (and usually myopic) tendencies, but it sure helped. And now, as the environments they created have become the content of our pop culture historical fiction, they seem just a bit removed from reality. Indeed, even as they convert new fans every year, the Beatles are history-- not quite ancient, but decidedly of another era. Of course, I wouldn't relish explaining this to someone who might have been around while all of it was going down. I can only imagine the kind of emotional indentures this band must have made on American kids in 1964-- and not just the fawning, screaming ones, but the ones watching culture bend and stretch before their eyes. Hell, even the jaded music critics writing about how the Beatles are history would never have been given the column space were it not for the old mania and fallout (such that now, rock = Stuff to Take Seriously). The early Capitol Beatles records are funny in the respect that for such a momentous happening, they were remarkably shrewdly (and many would argue, hastily) compiled and released. It didn't stop millions of people from falling in love; to see it happen would doubtlessly have been thrilling, but now we look at things with all kinds of distance. Capitol's second box set of LPs features all four (!) Beatles albums released in America in 1965: The Early Beatles, *Beatles VI, *Help!**, and Rubber Soul. All of the records are presented in both mono and stereo, which should be an exciting prospect for fans accustomed to hearing only mono versions of most of the early Beatles songs-- though beware, apparently the first pressing of the box contains incorrect mono mixes of Beatles VI and Rubber Soul. Capitol is supposed have addressed this on pressings after the first run. Nevertheless, most of this stuff has never been on CD, and I probably don't need to convince any diehard fans to run out and hear it. The sound is uniformly good (despite the mono mastering demi-fiasco), and if you don't mind that many of the stereo mixes essentially amount to vocals on left, instruments on right, these remasters represent the clearest, cleanest versions of most of these songs. Also, if you're curious, the American records were actually mixed slightly differently than the UK ones (more echo on the vocals here, a false start there), so if some of the songs seem a little different, they are. Of course, this set is probably aimed squarely at collectors and the very nostalgic anyway, so no need to feel like a shamed Beatle fan for not buying it as soon as you see it. The Early Beatles contains songs that originally appeared on the EMI's Please Please Me from 1963, but resequenced and missing three tunes (of which ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is the most notable). This record was actually released a couple of years after the Beatles' American debut, Introducing...The Beatles, which had been put out by Vee-Jay Records. Capitol later acquired the rights to the band's catalog, and put this out in 1965. Given the hysteria at the time, I'm guessing many fans didn't care. It's hard to argue with 100% proof pop like ""Please Please Me"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret?"", or ""P.S. I Love You"", though I've always thought it was weird that Ringo sung ""Boys"". Covers like ""Anna (Go to Him)"" and ""A Taste of Honey"" are more than serviceable, though the real attraction is John Lennon's famed larynx shredding take on ""Twist And Shout"". Beatles VI contains songs appearing elsewhere on the EMI albums Beatles For Sale and Help!. It's an odd mix of raucous covers (""Kansas City"", ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"", ""Bad Boy"") and more low-key stuff forecasting their move into more sophisticated territory (""Tell Me What You See"", the excellent ""Every Little Thing""). This guarantees a schizophrenic album experience, though the quality of the new Beatles originals probably gave fans at the time an awful lot to be happy about. Nevertheless, VI (unbelievably, the band's sixth American LP in less than two years) lives up to many a Beatle fanatic's claim of being the band's worst Capitol album. As with the band's UK albums, Help! is where things start to get really interesting. Most fans claim this is because the band was starting to open up to folk music, drugs, and relishing their own eclecticism. Of course, the American version of Help! is made all the more bizarre by including some Ken Thorne-composed incidental music from the Beatles' second movie. So, in between such classics as ""Ticket to Ride"" and the title track, you get James Bond riffs, Hitchcock strings, and a sitar-laden take on ""A Hard Day's Night"". God knows what fans thought at the time, though again, the new songs were such a leap beyond what the band was doing before, it's hard to see how anyone could have been disappointed. Recognizing the Beatles' shift in sound, Capitol emphasized the acoustic leanings of the band on its version of Rubber Soul. Leading off with ""I've Just Seen a Face"" (one of the great underrated McCartney tunes), and hitting most of the UK version of the record, the band served notice to anyone even halfway listening that they wouldn't be settling for mop-top glory. I doubt I need to say much about the best parts of Rubber Soul; the resequencing isn't as brutal here as on other Capitol albums, though ""It's Only Love"" (originally on the UK Help!) doesn't quite fit the mood. So: Four decent-to-really-good records with great sound for which most people born after 1965 will have limited need. At the very least, I enjoy hearing these songs in a slightly different light than I'm accustomed, though I wonder how long the band and its various business partners will be able to count on fans' interest in almost-as-good-as-new product. As I write this, the powers that be are said to be working on making their entire remastered catalog available via download, so perhaps the smart money is on the Beatles hanging around a while.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1096-the-capitol-albums-vol-2/,Capitol,2006.0
392,Prince,3121,"Pop/R&B,Rock",6.0,March 20 2006,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"There was a time when Prince was the gold standard for artistic expansion. Each of his opuses forayed into some new arena, and every shift in his approach correspondingly increased the size of the venues he toured. For more than a decade he was unstoppable, picking up the freaky funk baton from George Clinton and parlaying it into genuine superstardom. Funny, though, how short the trip from top of the pops to ""News of the Weird"" marginalization can be-- after changing his name to an unpronounceable ""love symbol"" in the early 1990s, he spent the better part of a decade roaming the wilderness, kicking out poorly distributed albums that ironically might have reached a larger audience had he not split from Warner Brothers to go it alone. From an image perspective, the New Power Generation era saw Prince transformed into a bizarre caricature of righteousness, religious and otherwise. But just as the path from peaks to lows can be quickly traversed, artists can swing back just as quickly, and 2004's Musicology gathered plaudits by the bushel, partially restoring Prince's critical reputation, as well as his commercial fortunes. In retrospect, it seems that Musicology was labeled a comeback in essence for not being an embarrassment. 3121 does a bit better than that, coming up with a handful of infectious songs-- it's his best since the symbol record, although certainly there remains a massive chasm between it and his masterpieces. Speaking in terms of his classic era, 3121 is more ""Gett Off"" than ""Nothing Compares 2 U"". The opening title track works almost entirely on eccentricity, as a huge crowd of pitch-shifted Princes harmonize on lyrics that basically amount to directions to a party. On the other end of the record, ""Get on the Boat"" boasts a sharp horn arrangement (with solos from Maceo Parker, no less) and a funk undercarriage vintage enough to have come straight from a thrift-shop basement-- and the loose, live feel doesn't hurt either. One thing that ""Get on the Boat"" exhibits in its piano part and timbale eruptions is a Latin influence that's more pervasive on 3121 than on any previous Prince album. ""Te Amo Corazon"" is a nicely nuanced ballad built on a slow, slightly rock-tinged mambo beat, and there are snatches of Cuban piano and Brazilian drums that crop up all over. Crunchy electro is the dominant strain in most of the album's best tracks, though, including the killer single ""Black Sweat"", the fractured keyboard riff of ""Lolita"", and ""Love"", inhabited by squishy keyboard and a monster chorus that slashes the ascending melody with buzzing synth bass. ""The Word"" strikes a nice electro-acoustic dichotomy, layering spacey synthesizer and a programmed beat with acoustic guitar and a strong sax hook. If the entire album were up to these levels, we'd be onto something, but ""Fury"" tempers the impact of its stunning lead guitar part with a hopelessly dated keyboard patch and generic rock drumming. ""Incense & Candles"" is predictable bedroom r&b; that relies too heavily on manipulated vocals, swerving into a little rap-like passage exactly when I began to think, ""I bet there's a little rap-like passage in this song."" He might have at least brought in a guest to deliver something more interesting. So, two albums into a career revival, Prince is still only kinda sorta ""back."" He's never going to be as surprising as he was in his heyday, of course, and it's probably unfair to expect anything like that from him again. All told, 3121 is a pretty ordinary-sounding record, largely stuck in another, friendlier sonic decade-- namely the 80s. If nothing else, Prince is slowly regaining the plot, and of course, there remain plenty of great old records in his catalog to revisit while he finds it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6481-3121/,Interscope,2006.0
393,The Pretenders,Pirate Radio,Rock,8.2,March 16 2006,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Rare is the box set that starts strong and stays strong. Usually the first disk or two contains everything you really need, and the last disks are full of late-career tracks that are highlights only compared to the songs that were omitted. Whether through the Pretenders' talent or by the compilers' design, Pirate Radio-- which is the band's first multidisk retrospective and a long time coming-- showcases a band that held onto its gritty gift for crafting complex songs with sharp melodic lines and smart(ass) lyrics. There are some duds here, but the high ratio of rockers to clunkers remains remarkably consistent across all four disk, which is no mean feat considering the Pretenders have been in an almost constant state of turnover since their very first album. Seemingly an ideal band for a box set like this, the Pretenders made at least one great album (their self-titled debut), a few good albums, and a couple of releases that are generously described as ""for-fans-only"". However, they were best song by song-- not just singles like ""Don't Get Me Wrong"" or ""Night in My Veins"", but album tracks like ""Thumbelina"" and ""Bad Boys Get Spanked"" as well. Collected together, these 81 songs-- presented in rough chronological order across four disks and complemented with a DVD of mostly lip-synced live appearances-- rarely ever sound dated. Furthermore, listening to them doesn't require any sort of trendy nostalgia for the late 70s or early 80s. Pirate Radio, in other words, proves more than simply artifactual: While even its weakest tracks contribute to its historical/biographical scope, the set proves an imminently listenable, often kick-ass collection. The Pretenders were post-punk chronologically, if not aesthetically. An ex-pat from Akron, singer Chrissie Hynde hung out with the Sex Pistols, scribed for NME, and clerked at Malcolm McLaren's notorious Sex shop. She was also desperate to be ""in a band,"" a need so strong the liner notes suggest it's pathological. So she hooked up with four guys from Hereford and formed the Pretenders just as punk was fizzling out. They fed off punk's visceral energy, but Hynde was too much of a fervent believer in capital-R Rock to buy into its nihilism. Also, while most other post-punk bands were experimenters and tinkerers, she was (and remains) a traditionalist, refining instead of redefining rock. Their modest goal, which they handily achieved, was to be a really good rock band: tight, inventive, aggressive, goofy, gutsy, and-- perhaps most important-- with a particular sound that could be readily identified as the Pretenders. They laid it all out on their self-titled 1979 debut, which includes some of their best songs: the country-inflected ""Kid"", the motorbike beat of ""Tattooed Love Boys"", the inimitable vocals and slangy lyrics on ""Brass in Pocket"", the show-closing ""Mystery Achievement"". People don't buy and comb through every lyric and riff of this album the same way they do Power, Corruption, and Lies or Entertainment!, but it's aged just as gracefully, retaining its original power. Nevertheless, a surprising eclecticism is encoded into the Pretenders' DNA, the byproduct of their transatlantic line-up and Hynde's coming-of-age to American radio. Pirate Radio includes convincing country songs like ""Tequila"", Bo Diddley rumbles like ""Cuban Slide"", shameless balladry like ""I'll Stand By You"", American soul numbers like their cover of ""Thin Line Between Love and Hate"", and blue-eyed soul songs like ""977"" (which borrows its melody from ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted?""). They could easily be gaudy and goofy (""The Adultress"") and maudlin (""Birds of Paradise"" or ""I'll Stand By You"", take your pick), but they treat all these styles as if they're all logical bedfellows under the Rock umbrella. Connecting all these disparate stylistic elements is Hynde's singular bravado, a vocal delivery both masculine and feminine, aggressive yet controlled, brash yet vulnerable-- contradictions that serve the song first and her persona second. Her voice has a crystalline quality that arcs tenderly on ""Kid"" and ""2000 Miles"", but she frequently launches into a kind of jive singspeak, rushing through her syllables without losing the meter. She can sell a line as mushy as ""I'm thinking of the fireworks that go off when you smile"" as persuasively as a raunchy line like ""You've got your chest on my back across a new Cadillac-oh yeah."" From the very first track on Pirate Radio through the very last, she maintains a complex and often contradictory front. In this regard, the television and concert clips on the DVD could potentially complement the music and portray another side of Hynde, but most of the material consists of awkward performances in which she either lip-syncs poorly or tries way too hard. Only the mid-80s concert footage of ""Middle of the Road"" hints at her considerable stage presence. Sadly, Hynde is the only constant throughout Pirate Radio's four disks, just as she was the only constant in the Pretenders. Original members Pete Farndon and James Honeyman Scott both OD'd (Farndon after being booted from the band, Scott after a night of pub hopping), and drummer Martin Chambers was fired, then rehired a few years later. Hynde carried on for years under the Pretenders moniker, never going solo; that's less a heroic act that a manifestation of her need to belong to a band, even if it allegedly inspired the hit ""Back on the Chain Gang"", which is reportedly about keeping the band together after Scott died. We should all be so lucky to have a memorial as lovely as Hynde's ""oh-oh-woa-whoa-whoa"" that punctuates each line of the verse. So Pirate Radio naturally rises and falls with her whims, and while it may have been tighter with three instead of four disks, the set shows an artist who helped to create and sustained a sound that has made the Pretenders stand out among nearly thirty years' worth of bands. The audience may have shrunk, but the songs remain the same.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6595-pirate-radio/,Rhino,2006.0
394,Neko Case,Fox Confessor Brings the Flood,Folk/Country,7.7,March 6 2006,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"The voice looms larger than ever. It's almost unfair. Draped in luscious, acute reverb, every phrase is granted its own pitch-perfect spotlight, and each precious syllable stands alone as a singular accomplishment. On Fox Confessor Brings the Flood, Neko Case's peerless cries crash through the mix with unprecedented force, their natural grandeur captured in sonorous surround sound. But it's not all about the voice; songs are important, too. Case's lungs-for-days Dollywood boom may be as direct an emotional instrument as there is in contemporary music, but her increasingly prominent songwriting skills tend to eschew visceral connections for intellectual intrigue and poetic mystery-- and Flood features Case's most cryptic lyrics to date. The odd disconnect here between singer and songwriter is absorbing: Though shaded by finely-tuned, country-noir twang, the rapturous belter's high-minded lyrical aspirations often undermine her throat's unhindered veracity. Given her former life as an art-school punk, Case's increasingly independent, non-traditional songwriting trajectory isn't totally surprising. Moving from the countrified mix of covers and originals of her solo debut, 1997's The Virginian, to 2000's Furnace Room Lullaby, which featured mostly originals co-written by Case, to 2002's Blacklisted, on which the singer wrote most of the alluringly bluesy songs on her own, Case's musical ambitions have evolved and taken greater definition with each successive album. Flood finds Case continuing to write the lion's share of her material, while also producing and mixing. Appropriately, it's a logical extension of the themes, instrumentation, and mood of Blacklisted. Long gone are the relatively straightforward Furnace-era break-up laments with their simple-yet-effective couplets like, ""Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', how can you forget/ All the love we had between us, now it's like we never met."" Removing herself from many of the album's David Lynch-like narratives, Case often embraces the role of omnipotent storyteller. One such twisty tale is the harrowing rich-girl/poor-girl opener, ""Margaret Vs. Pauline"". Strolling alongside a frolicking, Jon Brion-esque piano, wordy descriptors and odd details inform a striking gap between the song's haunting title pair. Describing the blessed beauty Pauline, Case sings, ""And they placed an ingot in her breast to burn cool and collected/ Fate holds her firm in its cradle and then rolls her for a tender pause to savor."" Lines like that don't roll off with ease, but within the scheme of the album, they can add up to something palpably uncomfortable-- a vague, inescapable sense of loss. Confessional only in the most roundabout sense, Case's songs set up strange anecdotal skeletons that beg listeners to connect the dots between. ""Star Witness"" may be about a car accident, a shooting, a deep love wiped away, or all of those things. Bound together by an awe-inspiring, harmony-laden hook, the swaying waltz may seem like free-associating farce at first, but subsequent exposures offer slight turns. There's no right answer to ""Star Witness"", but its keen open-endedness is an appealing destination in itself. Such complex examples of Case's unique songwriting string theory abound, from the ghostly, near-a cappella ""A Widow's Toast"", to the quasi-political, fable-based title track, to ""Dirty Knife"", a haunted-house elegy to madness. Each track relies on a starkly defined bleakness to guide its queasy understanding of an existence between the bitter end and its sometimes-sweeter aftermath. What once again prevents Case from delivering a front-to-back classic is a perfectionist streak that accounts for Flood's mannered meticulousness. A nice-enough reinterpretation of traditional folk spiritual ""John Saw That Number"" rumbles along amiably but Case can't adequately summon the spontaneous affectations that the gospel-style track requires to truly transcend. Though she often cites churchly touchstone Bessie Griffin as a guiding influence, it seems as if Case's hard-line precision rarely allows her to encapsulate Griffin's untethered style and act in the moment. Such flawless phrasing can cause songs to become too treasurable, as if they're off-limits, encrusted under a thick glass casing. Still, nobody today does eerie dust-bowl balladry and anachronistic rustic-murder milieu quite like Case. Combining country, folk, and old-school rock, she faithfully invokes scenes of late-night wandererings illuminated by a jalopy's lone functional headlight. As a refined version of Blacklisted, Flood provides alluring riddles and obsessive desolation, Case subverting her easy-access vocals with difficult abstractions and heady projections. Yet, after fishing through Flood's 12 intricate tracks, a plainspoken love song delivered in that voice would not be unwelcome.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1325-fox-confessor-brings-the-flood/,"Epitaph,Anti-",2006.0
395,Bob Marley & the Wailers,One Love at Studio One,Global,8.0,February 23 2006,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Ask 50 Americans who they think of first when they hear the word ""reggae"" and there's a good chance all of them will say ""Bob Marley"". As Mark Richardson wrote on this website last month, the Legend compilation is ubiquitous in college dormitories and singularly likely to show up in the collections of people who only own a handful of CDs. People know his Island output, even if they only know the sliver of it presented on that disc, and for many, Marley is reggae-- most people think the Wailers were just the backing band. Well, books could and have been written on the incredible scope of Jamaican music beyond Marley, who for better or worse became its face to most of the world in the 1970s. You could also write tomes telling the story of the Wailers before Chris Blackwell took them global. The core of the Wailers was Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, and several other members, including Constantine Walker, Beverly Kelso, and Junior Braithwaite came and went over the course of the 60s, when the group recorded with various backing bands for Coxsone Dodd's Studio One label. Between 1963 and 1966, the Wailers cut more than 100 tracks for Dodd, and Heartbeat's One Love at Studio One gathers 40 of them plus one interesting rehearsal onto two discs. This release is essentially a spiffing up of an earlier Heartbeat compilation of the same name, with one added track (the spiritual ""Tell Them Lord"") and greatly improved sound-- the mastering level on this version towers over the original, and the bass presence is kicked way up to accentuate the rhythmic thrust of the group's early ska sides. Curiosities abound on these discs. From a historical perspective, some of the most interesting tracks are their versions of the spirituals ""Sinner Man"", ""Amen"", ""This Train"", and ""Tell Them Lord""-- impassioned takes on Christian songs that function as interesting precursors of their later embrace of Rastafarianism. Though Bob Marley was the acknowledged leader of the group from the start-- and the only one with previous recording experience-- it's important to note that the group was just called the Wailers, without the ""Bob Marley &"" until around 1970, and that other members sang lead on a large number of their songs. Braithwaite, an original member of the group and the first to leave, was Dodd's favorite voice in the group, and he gets his high tenor out in front of the harmonies on ""Habits"" and ""It Hurts to Be Alone"", the latter featuring an unbelievably gorgeous lead guitar part from Ernest Ranglin. The Wailers' first single, ""Simmer Down"", is one of the defining tracks of the ska era, addressing the violence of the Kingston slums in the patois of the people who lived there. The Skatalites provide the breathtaking rhythm track and horn arrangements, and Kelso, Tosh, Wailer, and Braithwaite harmonize the title under Marley's rough-throated verses. For a one-track recording, there's an impressive amount of detail in the mix, and the song became an instant smash when Dodd played it at his sound system dance the same night it was recorded, quickly moving 70,000 copies. If that doesn't sound like a big number, consider that in the 1960s the total population of Jamaica was less than two million. There are a ton of other great ska cuts spread out across the rest of the set, including a number of excellent rude boy tracks that helped establish the Wailers as spokesmen for the ghetto and the warring gangs of dance crashers who ultimately brought the sound systems to their demise in the late 60s. ""Rude Boy"", which later became the basis for ""Rebel's Hop"", and ""Hooligan"" celebrated rudie attitude, the former featuring lyrics like ""the peego a-go lingua"" (roughly, ""the rude girls are gonna' talk""), that illustrated just how deep the slang of the ghettos could get. The group's initial phase closed with ""Jailhouse"", one of countless Jamaican singles of the period that extolled the fearlessness of the rude boys when confronted by the authorities-- the song also shows them transitioning to the slower rocksteady beat that formed the bridge from ska to reggae. In 1966, Bob Marley went to Delaware to earn money for a planned Wailers label, and Bunny and Peter recruited Constantine Walker to fill his place, recording numerous Wailers sides while Bob was gone. Marley's elevation to iconic status overshadowed Bunny and Peter's estimable solo output, and the Bob-less tracks here show that either one would have been capable of leading the group. The two share lead vocals on the stunning rocksteady tracks ""Who Feels it Knows it"" and ""When the Well Runs Dry"". The harmonies are noticeably sweeter in the absence of Marley, and ""What Am I Supposed to Do"" vies with Alton Ellis's ""Why Birds Follow Spring"" and the Paragons' ""On the Beach"" for the prettiest rocksteady song I've heard. One other remarkable thing about this compilation is the sheer number of songs that don't feature the distinctive Jamaican off-beat accent. Right into 1966, the Wailers regularly recorded straight r&b; and rock'n'roll tracks, and though their version of the Beatles' ""And I Love Her"" (previously unreleased) leaves much to be desired, a number of these songs are fantastic, especially Tosh's Nuggety ""Can't You See"" and the band's outright jaw-dropping version of Dion's ""Teenager in Love"". Indeed, the Wailers continued to record non-reggae songs all the way through their 1970 Island debut Soul Rebels, which features a couple of fantastic funk cuts. All these curiosities add up to very solid set, but all of the alternate takes and rarities make it one that's decidedly for fans-- of Marley and early reggae alike. For newcomers, it might be best to start with Marley's 70s material (it's more of a kick to hear the title track of this comp if you already know the version on Legend and Exodus, not to mention U2's ""One"") and work your way to this set via the Skatalites and some Studio One compilations. If you dig that stuff, One Love at Studio One will likely make you very happy.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5674-one-love-at-studio-one/,Heartbeat,2006.0
396,Bob Marley & the Wailers,Africa Unite: The Singles Collection,Global,7.0,February 1 2006,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Bob Marley's Legend is probably the one album most likely to be found in the collections of people who only own 10 CDs. It's time-honored and universal, spanning almost all backgrounds, professions, and upbringings, and those who gave up on following music before the compact disc era are as likely to have a copy lying around as those who just got into the Velvets at school last year. Legend, for many, is reggae; the genre begins with ""Could You Be Loved"" and ends with ""Jamming"". But as weathered and worn-out as this compilation has become-- and man, am I tired of it-- it didn't attain its stature by force of marketing. Marley wrote accessible, all-embracing songs, had a radiant voice, and backed himself with great bands. The problem with Legend is not that people love it, but what that love means to Island Records, and how it translates to Africa Unite, their recent repackaging of the compilation. Eleven of Legend's 14 songs appear here, meaning those whom this collection is directly aimed at already own most of it. Granted, beyond those 11 are nine new cuts for the casual fan, but then two of these are simply slight remixes that few will find enticing. Black-Eyed Peas' will.i.am, for example, was given the nod to update the compilation's title song, but his clumsy programmed drums are mixed much too high and fail to deliver the intended effect of bringing the track up to date. ""Stand Up Jamrock"" finds Ashley Beedle mashing up ""Get Up Stand Up"" with brief snippets of Damian Marley's ""Welcome to Jamrock"", which may make some sense thematically but drains life from both tunes. If anything, it's a reminder that, yeah, ""Jamrock"" would sound pretty good right about now. Africa Unite's biggest draw-- and likely the only real incentive for its release-- is the new song ""Slogans"", which was pieced together ""Free as a Bird""-style by adding a full band to an acoustic demo Marley cut in a hotel room in 1979. ""Slogans"" is a nice song, and its backing arrangements, assembled under the direction of Stephen and David Marley, integrates it well into the catalog. The production faithfully replicates the careful (some would say overly slick) studio sound of his late-70s years at Island, with Eric Clapton adding some restrained fills that threaten to get in the way but never quite do. But even if this material tacked onto Africa Unite's second half serves as the compilation's impetus, the disc's first track points toward the real area of exploration for Marley neophytes. This compilation is the first ever to combine pre-Island recordings with the material that made Marley a household name. And the opening ""Soul Rebel"", which Bob and the Wailers cut with Lee ""Scratch"" Perry at the boards, hasn't lost a bit of its earthy appeal. The Complete Upsetter Singles is the place those made curious by familiar Marley hits should look next. Download ""Slogans"" somewhere-- it's worth the 99 cents-- and then set your sights for Scratch-produced sides like ""Small Axe"" and ""Mister Brown"".",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5673-africa-unite-the-singles-collection/,Island,2005.0
397,Miles Davis,The Cellar Door Sessions 1970,Jazz,9.4,January 17 2006,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Firing like a machine gun over a heavily armored and equipped outfit of young, brawny assassins, Miles Davis ruled the world at the end of 1970. A year removed from his ""corruption"" at the hands of rock-- if you believe dozens of decaying jazz critics, that is-- Davis had the band and the vision to play music that no one would ever play again. His arsenal: ""Directions"", ""What I Saw"", ""Honky Tonk"", ""Inamorata"", ""It's About That Time""; with only Joe Zawinul's ""Directions"" having been played by any of Davis' groups before, the trumpeter had to know he was making a statement. In fact, none of the new stuff had more than a few notes, a couple of chord changes to distinguish it from ""formless jamming"" (to borrow another phrase from a critic), and if fans thought Bitches Brew was out there, what would they make of this? A few months removed from playing to 600,000 at the Isle of Wight, Davis had the nerve to hole up at The Cellar Door in Washington D.C., a small club holding no more than a couple hundred people. And he killed them. He and his band launched bomb after bomb for four nights; he slew every last person at the show, and listening to this noise now, it makes me want to kick the nonbelievers in the teeth. Fans will already know some of the music on the overwhelming 6xCD The Cellar Door Sessions 1970 because much of its final disc (from the band's last date at the club) was issued on 1971's Live-Evil. Of course, it was cut-up, rearranged, and interspersed with studio tracks, so even familiar performances sound new here. The box contains six of the 10 sets Davis' band played, remixed and sounding great (especially via an increased presence from Michael Henderson's bass), and extensive notes from everyone who played there-- except Davis. It's a shame we don't know what the band's leader thought of this stuff, because there is a case to be made that Henderson, drummer Jack DeJohnette, saxophonist Gary Bartz, keyboardist Keith Jarrett, and Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira comprised his last indisputably great band. When guitarist John McLaughlin shows up for the last set, things seems even more fiery, more volatile, and I always have to fight the urge to blast my neighbors into next week. In any case, I can only guess Davis was pleased-- in fact, he leaves most of the lengthy solo pace to his bandmates, content to let this stew brew and brew and brew. The first disc (from the band's first set on Wednesday night) begins right on Davis' solo from ""Directions"". DeJohnette is already playing like a motherfucker, nailing polyrhythms straight out of a drum'n'bass tune, and Davis flutters from behind a wah-wah pedal in turn. When he removes the effect, he plays high-pitched jabs-- a favorite move at the time-- and mixes in some furious runs, the kind he was gradually learning to leave behind as his music became more aggressive, more primal, LESS JAZZ. On the spacious ""Yesternow"" (originally from the Jack Johnson LP), the band stretches out. Nevertheless, Davis' solo is a strident mix of punches and runs, with Jarrett echoing him on the left after each phrase. Jarrett had already lit the fire under the track during his lengthy intro solo-- in fact, he was given a very long leash during these dates, frequently being allotted complete freedom to bring in tracks with unaccompanied performances. The band closes shop with the funked-out ""Inamorata"" and Davis' screaming melody. We're just getting started. The second disc, from the next night, begins with DeJohnette's deft pulse on ""What I Say"", Henderson hitting the downbeats like a rock. Jarrett again begins things with a flighty, short-breathed solo on electric piano before Davis comes in with the piercing ""melody"" (which is mostly more high-note jabs that I imagine took out the eyes of the first row of club patrons). Bartz takes off after a particularly agitated Davis solo, and the tune seems to jump into another gear altogether-- and the audience responds in kind with the first of many animated reactions to his solos. On ""Honky Tonk"", something of a gospel blues vamp, the band brings everything way down, as Henderson plays the main riff under Jarrett's shimmering piano asides. Davis' solo afterwards sounds almost suffocated by the dirge of a pulse, but given that remainder of the band's set featured blow-outs like ""It's About That Time"" (here, with an unbelievably funky coda) and ""Inamorata"", he may just have been venting his anticipation. Friday night's shows are spread over discs 3 and 4, the first of which contains epic versions of ""What I Say"", ""Directions"", and ""Honky Tonk"". I should note that the band never sounds out of breath in the slightest. Moreira's cuica squeak is all over the intro, as if chomping at the bit to let the floodgates open; Davis comes in about three minutes into the tune, nailing a wailing pitch into his solo and taking flight with a runs as if this was the first shot he'd ever gotten to play this stuff. Likewise, Jarrett's opening solo on ""Honky Tonk"" runs the gamut from blues, to modern jazz to an early run at the kind of exploratory impressionism he'd play on his own The KÃ¶ln Concert years later-- these guys held a grand total of zero back. ""Inamorata"" from the fourth disc winds up for a minute before launching its main riff, as if the band were stretching its collective muscles and firing one last silo before disappearing into the night. Davis crawls out from between the twin locomotives of DeJohnnette and Henderson with a wah-wah'd solo, and it's obvious they probably could have gone on for hours. The Saturday night shows on discs 5 and 6, and the introduction of guitarist McLaughlin (whose late flight only allowed him to make the tail end of their gigs), brings home an abundantly clear point: This period was apex for Davis and his band. Reissue co-producer Adam Holzman makes the point that this music was a sort of end-game for Davis' Bitches Brew ideas, before leaping off into the funky underworlds of On the Corner and the hazy, quasi-psychedelic shows of his touring band from 1973-75. McLaughlin's jaw-dropping solo on ""Directions"" from the last disc serves notice to anyone who forgot that Davis really did want to play rock music, but with the intelligence and technique of jazz. It's tough to find very many examples on record of people playing with as much intensity or inspiration. Funny enough, some of the guys mention in the box's notes that they weren't quite sure what to expect with McLaughlin's arrival. I guess it only goes to show you can't stop genius in the making. In December 1970, you couldn't stop Miles Davis.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2201-the-cellar-door-sessions-1970/,Columbia,2006.0
398,Lil Wayne,Tha Carter II,Rap,8.1,January 12 2006,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"Something great happened last week on The Tonight Show, poor Leno notwithstanding. Camera on musical guest Lil' Wayne, bassist behind him on pasty octaves, some keyboard ""funk"" preset, really thin till the guitars flange in. This is Alan-born Robin Thicke's ""Oh Shooter"" they're playing, straight-up, and Thicke, on stage beside Wayne, begins his stick'd-up anthem, his breath caught as it would be near chrome. Tune in then and you'd think Thicke was the star and Weezy just his cough-n-pepper hypeman. ""I brought my homeboy with me,"" says standing Wayne of singing Thicke. He's kidding, right? Technically this is Wayne's song called ""Shooter"", but the entire ""song"", down to the track length, is Thicke's original. What a tense performance so far; music played, but you could probably hear a pin drop. This young New Orleans rapper bouncing around on stage with Real Musicians but not much else, good for a laugh or a breakdance or whatever Other-approved televised woop-de-doo-- ""cute"" and ""rap's not so bad after all"" but also ""rapping is easy,"" ""rap=only good as the sample it swiped"". Wayne was holding us at bay, all our presuppositions about his career, his music, his age and color, his responsibility qua artist post-Katrina. If Thicke's the crybaby here, Wayne's the stick-up kid. ""They want me with my hands up,"" sings Thicke, doing that stupid ""raise the roof"" thing. Wayne breaks: ""I'm trying to tell you what I am, baby-- listen."" And after almost two minutes of no talking he bursts the song open: ""So many doubt cos I come from the South, but when I open my mouth the best come out. It's my turn and I'm starting right here today."" And so on-- it's one of those black-and-white-to-technicolor moments after which, if you still don't believe in Wayne, you're just lying to yourself. Granted, Leno won't make ""Shooter"" Wayne's ""song"" (it will be though), and we definitely can't call Tha Carter II his coming-of-age album or something equally corny-- people blew that line on the one before. Fact is, Wayne's still young, and he loves that he can get away with shit-- literally. Firmly keeping a foot in the sandbox, Wayne dabbles scatological throughout (""Dear Mr. Toilet/ I'm the shit""), sometimes even elaborately so (""You niggas small bubbles, I burp you/ I'll spit you out and have your girls slurp you""). Total energy thing, his verses still lack polish and a good edit (e.g. so many goddamn shark jokes), and his skits and ""personality raps"" (cf. ""Grown Man"") spell him out too bluntly, too vainly. And yet, there's ""Shooter"", or ""Receipt"", or ""Get Over"": ""Standin' on stage in front of thousands/ Don't amount to me not having my father."" Lines like this fall outta nowhere, jaw-droppers aplenty-- but ""don't forget the baby"". People who met Wayne on ""Go DJ"" and thought him a lunchroom hack emcee-- who knows what's happened since then, but damn has he learned how to write. His squeak is now a croak, his laugh a little more burly, his flow remarkably flexible. Sometimes he's deliberate like syrup cats (""But this is Southern, face it/ If we too simple then yall don't get the basics"") but when he needs to be, he's nimble as that Other Carter: ""I ain't talking too fast you just listening too slow."" Remy and weed, fast things and women, the corner-- these are Wayne's wax since B.G.'ing with B.G., putting piff on the campus before he ever enrolled in college. What's different, and crucial: no Mannie Fresh electro-dixie beats. Free from Fresh, Wayne is less a novelty-- less Pinocchio on Pleasure Island (cf. 500 Degreez), less that dorm-room poster of the baby giving the middle finger. In fact, no-name nawlins producers run the boards, their crackly soul sampling and that implied return-to-rap roots a perfect complement to Weezy's raspy, sometimes even Miles Davisian voice. On ""Receipt"", which lifts the Isleys' ""Lay-Away"", Wayne's nursery rhyme delivery grants pick-ups like ""my daughter want another/ Sister or brother/ And you looking like a mother"" that rare smooth-crude game, something a young Curtis Jackson wanted out of ""Best Friend"" but didn't quite get. ""I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public,"" he says on ""Money On My Mind."" To an extent, he's right. This is Wayne's show, the album's only guests being Kurupt and Birdman and some r&b; b-girls. Not to say he's ungrateful; it's just that establishing his autonomy, his don't give a fuck, is infinitely more important. Lead track ""Tha Mobb"" really lays the audience/methodology/goals stuff on thick: For five minutes, no chorus, sad piano, he does it for ""the gangstas and the bitches, the hustlers and the hos."" Crossover? ""Whatever."" Mainstream? ""No!"" He refuses to be a Big artist, precisely so he can be a big Artist. Shirking responsibility then? Katrina happened after most these tracks were cut, so let's not be assholes. He worked in a few rhymes after the fact, very simple stuff like ""gotta get the hood back after Katrina"" on ""Feel Me"". But the line that follows is more telling: ""Weezy F. Baby, the 'F' is for 'FEMA'."" FEMA, that lark, and so goes his point: For relief, he's not responsible. While Wayne hasn't made Tha Carter II a ""Katrina album"" in the obvious respect (cf. that horrendous ""George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People"" song rock critics like because they ""get"" it), he's given New Orleans something much greater-- someone, one of their own, to believe in. ""If I talk it I walk it like Herschel,"" he says on ""Mo Fire"", his syllables out his mouth like smoke rings-- he means sex, other things too.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4997-tha-carter-ii/,Cash Money,2005.0
399,Isaac Hayes,Ultimate Isaac Hayes-- Can You Dig It?,Pop/R&B,8.0,November 27 2005,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Today, Isaac Hayes resides indelibly in the mainstream American consciousness primarily for two things: the ""Theme from Shaft"", and his recurring role as an over-sexed school cafeteria chef on ""South Park"", where he essentially poked fun at his own lover-man image. As much as they've become cultural touchstones, these two things hardly epitomize the man's career or indicate the length of the shadow he cast on r&b.; Here was a guy who cut a few obscure sides and then spent the next five years of his career as a session musician and songwriter for Stax Records, plying his craft in the service of others, and who also turned out to be a ridiculously charismatic performer in his own right. His booming baritone and sweeping Spector-squared arrangements set the tone for a whole generation of r&b; in the 1960s, while his 70s Blaxploitation soundtracks largely defined the genre with their chicken-scratch wah guitars, stabbing strings, and tough vocals. And of course he had his monologues-- long, sometimes rambling speeches that he unapologetically used to preface the meat of many of his songs. Can You Dig It? packs two discs wall-to-wall with 32 of the best tracks Hayes recorded under his own name, understandably leaving out the significant portion of his career he spent laboring for Stax, though you could certainly focus an interesting compilation on his early work backing and writing for other performers-- the guy co-wrote ""Soul Man"", after all. The whole extravaganza kicks off with that familiar twittering hi-hat, joined by one of the coolest rhythm guitar parts ever, and...is it possible not to like the ""Theme From Shaft""? It gets something of a novelty rap, mostly as a result of innumerable terrible karaoke performances, but this is a truly badass piece of music, heinous funk rhythms and an entire symphony orchestra all building to a casually awesome drum fill that drops you into that ultra-smooth sing-rap. ""Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?"" Hayes was talking about the Richard Roundtree character, but much of it applies to himself as well. A Google image search for the man reveals a gallery of way-too-cool shots of Hayes with his shaved head, perpetual sunglasses and shirtless displays of gold body hardware, but Hayes did more than his share to live up to that image in his music. The cross-section of that music captured in this tracklisting is about as good as it gets. Highlights from Hayes' other soundtrack work-- his theme from Tough Guys is sweet 'n' nasty proto-disco with a synth bass part from another planet-- mingle with album cuts, minor hits, and a few edits of his longest tracks, including a seven-minute reduction of his epic reading of Jimmy Webb's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"". Thankfully, the compilers have left intact the entire 12 minutes of his definitive take on Bacharach/David's ""Walk on By"", a psychedelic funk odyssey filled with scorching fuzz guitar solos and grandiose string arrangements that's as close to perfect as any song of that length could be. It's hard for anything to top ""Walk on By"", but Hayes hardly needs to worry about that when his second tier includes songs like ""Do Your Thing"", an essential slab of languid bongo funk, the throbbing, horn-soaked instrumental ""Disco Connection"", and ""Hyperbolicsyllabic-sesquadelymistic"", a nine-minute funk crawl capped by an out-of-this world piano solo that Public Enemy later snipped a portion of for the basis of ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"". ""Joy, pt. 1"" went a long way toward establishing him as a master of seductive r&b;, wrapping direct sexuality in a pillowy love song packed with flutes, strings and horns. It's actually a little jarring sitting next to the plaintive live version of the traditional gospel song ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" There are only a few places in the two-plus hours of music here where not everything works. ""For the Good Times"" is a little too smooth, while the five-minute monologue that opens ""I Stand Accused"" is practically self-parody, and boring to boot. The need to edit down a few of the longer tracks is unfortunate, but understandable (if anything they could have lopped the intro of ""I Stand Accused""), and anyone who wants the full-length versions of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" or ""Do Your Thing"" can simply scoop up Hot-Buttered Soul or the Shaft soundtrack-- you'll want to own them anyway. Regardless, this is a phenomenal introduction to a man whose career was positively elemental both to 70s r&b; and funk and to the development of the album as a forum for stretching out and experimenting.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4030-ultimate-isaac-hayes-can-you-dig-it/,Stax,2005.0
400,The Roots,"Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding the Roots, Vols. 1 & 2",Rap,6.9,November 22 2005,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"There's not much to understand, really. The only song you really need-- and, blasphemy!, you're getting this out a Philly cat-- is ""Push Up Ya Lighter"", from 1996's Illadelph Halflife. The Roots band never came closer to that tight-wound, RZA-squared minimalism, and they did it there without compromising their looser jazz/soul/funk sensibilities (check the watery, monkish keyb progression). The Roots worked a few years behind New York's producers in the beginning, but when records like ""Clones"" or ""Concierto of the Desperado"" hit, they made comparable Alc and RZA tracks sound demo. Allmusic loves dropping the Stetsasonic bomb when time comes to squash the ridiculously common ""Roots are the first hip-hop band"" belief among those who first saw the Roots at their college SpringFest (same kids on facebook who like ""hip-hop for dancing."") But that doesn't mean live instruments lost their cachet, especially for ingratiating 1990s hip-hop to rockies and jazzbos. Remember, too, that the Roots put Jay-Z in that Unplugged game, and I don't think anybody has taken the time to mine that moment for its music-cultural relevance. And yet as much as they shine musically, Roots MCs Black Thought and to a much lesser extent Malik B struggle with the pen. ""Lighter"" covers all the topics and touchstones: coming to terms with modern hip-hop's rags-or-riches come-up; repping Philly; repping hip-hop's Blackness; loving ladies right. Vaguely conscious, literary insofar as he was a tad sophistic, Black Thought spouts truisms in deft internal rhyme schemes, but after a decade dude still doesn't have a single memorable line, and that's foul. The better Roots mic moments have always been on the guest spots, and lady Bahamadia's work here (""Inclined to rap about facts, I never fake jacks/ Shit is real like E packs"") recalls past upstagings from Common, Dice Raw, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Cody ChestnuTT, Q-Tip, usw. Pride's a bitch, though. Had this band thought of themselves as producers and made records with different rappers rather than convince themselves of some personal unfuckwithable aesthetic, they could have killed. Home Grown! should kill me on nostalgia alone, but all I can think of is how the Roots refused to back Jay-Z at Live 8, some snub factor or another, and how in retrospect the only reason I liked them was because they're a band, and at 13 that made it the only rap music I could play in my parents' rap-is-not-music cars. (Hey, that's how Beth and Barry roll.) Otherwise, sorry, the Roots never mustered much consequence-- musically speaking, this is a completely insular career of mostly great beats and half-realized rhymes. They have a loyal following the same way Dave Matthews or Pat McGee or moe. have them, and surely their loyal fans picked up all the rarities and unreleased these and those along the way-- maybe even off that triple-disc bootleg that was on the shelves for a minute this time last year. The rest of you might like to know that the band remixed ""Don't Say Nuthin'"", last year's worst rap single by a kilo, which I take as tacit admission they thought the same. The dub take on neo-dull song ""Break You Off"" ain't bad, and the live medley of ""The Seed/Melting Pot/The Web"" has this nasty snare-on-quarters backbeat for ""Seed"" that's worth talking about. Still, I don't know why Geffen split this into two separate volumes except for the obvious $$$ reasons, and I don't know why, after culling pretty evenly from their studio LPs, the Roots left off ""Push Up Ya Lighter"". Criminy. Maybe then I would have read the liners.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6835-home-grown-the-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-roots-vols-1-2/,Geffen,2005.0
401,Nirvana,Sliver: The Best of the Box,Rock,6.8,October 30 2005,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"In May 2002, Courtney Love bragged to Rolling Stone: ""I have the Holy Grail of rock and roll,"" referencing the already-legendary box of 109 unreleased Nirvana and Kurt Cobain demos, outtakes, and experiments. ""Not all of it's great,"" she admitted. ""On those tapes are everything from shitty collages to some pretty stunning, awe-inspiring acoustic songs to stupid, fucked-up shit."" In 2004, just in time for Christmas, bits from Love's infamous cache of cassettes appeared on the With the Lights Out box set, a collection of 61 tracks with a list price of $60-- the supposedly definitive postscript to Kurt Cobain's April 1994 suicide. Sliver: The Best of the Box is a pared-down version of With the Lights Out, adding three tracks that didn't appear on that set. Without getting too deep into shifty-eyed corporate conspiracy theories (the previously unreleased demos included here are said to be ""freshly"" unearthed), it's difficult to see Sliver as anything more than a sneaky swindle designed to aggravate Nirvana completists who already own the box set and don't otherwise require another non-self-compiled best-of. But no matter how much slack you're willing to cut Geffen, Sliver reeks of manipulative marketing. Granted, posthumous releases are always delicate ground-- publishing Cobain's private journals, for instance, made plenty of his followers squirm-- but this is excessive. What's worse, none of Sliver's three new songs are particularly revelatory or dynamic: The long-sought-after rendition of ""Spank Thru""-- which, strikingly, has never even been available on bootlegs-- is pure artifact, hinting at an embryonic Nirvana. While diehard fans are no strangers to the song itself (a later version appeared on the legendary Sub Pop 200 compilation, while 1996's From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah-- already the second posthumous Nirvana release-- featured a live cut), Sliver's version appeared on 1985's infamous ""Fecal Matter"" demo tape, and features a throaty, 18-year-old Cobain on guitar and vocals, backed by the Melvins' Dale Crover on drums and bass. Oddly, the quality of the recording is stellar in contrast to the rest of the album's material, and every vocal tic and nuance is instantly palpable. Still, complete with mid-song coughs and ridiculous electric guitar wrestling, ""Spank Thru"" was obviously never destined to hit record stores, and while it's an interesting anthropological bit (and a charming ode to jerking off), Sliver's melodramatic unveiling of the track is somewhat insulting to Nirvana's devoted legions. Sliver also offers a demo of ""Come as You Are"", supposedly recorded for Butch Vig in 1991 before he began working on Nevermind. Unsurprisingly, it sounds shitty, and nothing new or particularly interesting transpires in its four minutes. The most worthwhile of the three bonus tracks is a 1990 studio demo of ""Sappy"", a version of which appeared as an unlisted track on the 1993 charity compilation No Alternative. (The song, which had no official title on that disc, was often referred to as ""Verse Chorus Verse""-- even now, dissenters wrestle over which version of the song deserves which title). Here, it's studio-quality, and, though slightly more plodding than the No Alternative version, still a great track. Chances are, most Nirvana fans are hungry for rare and unreleased songs, not scrappy demos of singles or semi-absurd teenage wankery. Still, there is a bit of good news. As plenty of critics and fans agreed in 2004, With the Lights Out was overstuffed, curated without care, and bloated by poorly recorded, destined-for-the-recycling-bin demos and unflattering vocal portraits. Sliver fulfils its promise to cull ""The Best of the Box"" (see: ""Do Re Mi"", ""Old Age"", and a live ""Floyd the Barber""), and though it may be irritatingly superfluous, as a collection of B-sides, demos, and outtakes, it lives up to its subtitle.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5812-sliver-the-best-of-the-box/,Geffen,2005.0
402,Depeche Mode,Playing the Angel,"Electronic,Rock",7.0,October 19 2005,Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,"First things first: You can count me among that class of people who haven't paid the closest attention to Depeche Mode over the past, umm, decade. I don't imagine this is all that unusual. Sure, the music they've released seems fine enough. But laying claim to our brainspace takes more than that, and each album these guys produced seemed to be slotting them further and further into that place where groups just naturally wind up after a couple decades as a going concern-- the band version of adulthood. Band adulthood is where you've settled into enough of a groove that your core fans know who they are, and everyone else happily ignores your continued existence. Band adulthood is where you make perfectly fine and increasingly subtle and sophisticated new albums, and your members embark on highly touted Significant Solo Projects-- neither of which anyone can really work up any enthusiasm about. Band adulthood means reviews that are a big swirl of stock phrases like ""return to form"" and ""just may be their best since [insert classic here]""; it's a world of die-hard fans politely trying to convince everyone that actually, this new album, it's interesting, you should give it a listen. Band adulthood is a city where R.E.M. and Elvis Costello have offices downtown, and the Cure and New Order keep stopping by open houses in the suburbs. No mistake: people of all sorts still love their Depeche Mode; last year I even got to watch a 19-year-old metalhead dig back and convert. But people want their prime-era DM, not a paler adulthood. Even the titles of the band's last couple releases seemed to know it: after Ultra (!) and Exciter (!), I'm half-surprised they didn't manage to call one No Really, We're Still Worth It. If you've caught any advance word on Playing the Angel, you'll probably have heard the same rumors that swirl around all band-adulthood records: That this is the one, the ""return to form."" That this isn't just the ""best since Violator,"" but maybe even just as good. That they're about to pull off the same trick Morrissey did-- following the same path as always, and yet somehow getting everyone to sit up again and take notice. (Publicists help.) And while I wish I could take some bold, controversial true/false stance on that one, this album just won't let me. If you really are the sort of person who's been waiting with bated breath for a new Depeche Mode release, then don't worry: You'll love this. Dear everyone else: It's pretty okay. It certainly sounds as good as anything they've done in a while-- and isn't that always the key with these things? Band-adulthood records leave everyone in fear of limp retreads, embarrassingly bombastic attempts to capturing former glory, ill-advised experiments, laughable bandwagon-jumping, or that ultimate horror of classic acts trying to ape the bands they're meant to have influenced. Depeche Mode have long managed to avoid those traps (say, ""showing Linkin Park how it's really done""), and on this record they've done even better, hitting on something that feels solid and relevant and natural: a dense, buzzy web of sound that folds in the old arena anthems, the camp noir-gospel of the early 90s, and the polished micro-production of Exciter. The whole problem of the ""new"" DM has always been the gap between the clean-lined synth clang of their prime era and the lush, fussy computer-assisted electronics of today; the most surprising tracks here shoot past that issue entirely. ""Precious"", the first single, works some slow-rolling ""Enjoy the Silence"" beauty-- but the whole thing's riding on burbling acid-synth lines, retro-classic and up-to-the-minute at the same time. ""John the Revelator"" does up-tempo ""Master and Servant"" pulse and ""Condemnation"" choir calls over ultra-modern bleep and click, ""A Pain That I'm Used To"" does slow industrialist grind, and some other tracks pull off something like Depeche Mode torch songs. Yes, they've got their style working, their production mostly down, and Dave Gahan's singing gets richer and better with each passing record. Only here's the thing: Surely a pop album lives or dies by its songs. And while the sounds here, apart from some sterile ""modern"" clicks and flourishes, climb their way past the pitfalls of the 25-year-old band, the songs here can't. Give any songwriter a couple decades, and the same things will happen-- the writing gets progressively more subtle, more sophisticated, until eventually it's curiously free of spark, always skirting the obvious old hooks in favor of something too professional to even notice. It's all here: the arch, wandering melodies; the methodically constructed key changes; the weirdly formless slow-and-quiet epics; the standard lyrical stew of religion and lust and fragile, innocent, faithful things in a dark, dark world. Yes, this group has spent the past 15 years trading in mood and atmosphere-- much more so than the relentlessly tight pop of their 1980s arena days. Yes, given enough time, they'll gather up into something passably engaging. No, no one's asking for karaoke classics. But none of the moods and atmospheres and slow-growers here stand much of a chance of reaching out and drawing you in-- or of making a believer out of anyone who didn't believe already. The end product, then, is one of those signature artifacts of the Adult Band: an album we hardly even need to review. Depeche Mode's core fans will flip for it; it's the best thing they've released in a long while. Everyone else? It's pretty okay. And these days, over a decade since Songs of Faith and Devotion, well, you already know which of those two camps you fall into.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2285-playing-the-angel/,Mute,2005.0
403,My Morning Jacket,Z,Rock,7.6,October 6 2005,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Here's an album that begs for vinyl, although not for the reason you might think. Certainly, My Morning Jacket's worn-in rock 'n' roll-- its starchy guitar riffs and Jim James' other-end-of-a-long-tunnel vocals-- seems tailor-made for the intimate crackle of a dusty turntable. But the concisely titled Z, the band's fourth full-length, needs to be flipped over: It has two distinct sides. Granted, most albums still rely on the two-sided format the same way most movies still rely on the three-act plot, adhering to it almost subconsciously. But I'm not entirely sure My Morning Jacket intended such a dramatic difference between these two half Zs. As Side One begins, the presence of producer John Leckie (of Radiohead, Stone Roses, and, er, Kula Shaker fame) is immediately evident. ""Wordless Chorus"" launches Z with a hardscrabble sound that recalls their earlier material, suggesting that the brighter production and looser, jambandier approach of It Still Moveswas a slight detour. There are more keyboards on these songs, courtesy of new member Bo Koster, and more confident experimentation-- a little reggae, a little r&b, even a little ambient. Defiantly flaunting their rural eccentricities, My Morning Jacket once again recall the earliest of early R.E.M., before you could understand Stipe's mumbling, back when the Georgia foursome defined themselves by claiming a birthright to kudzu-covered mythology. It's not really My Morning Jacket's sound that suggests this comparison, but their willingness to let the music retain its mystery despite the risk of seeming obscure or evasive. So Z abandons the Skynyrdisms of It Still Moves, but that album's lessons remain intact: Compared to those on previous albums, these tracks have more guitar crunch and tighter song structures. Even single ""Off the Record"", with its driving reggae rhythms and James' lively performance, foregoes a dueling-guitar climax in favor of an unraveling outro that sounds like Air noir. ""Wordless Chorus"" hinges on just what its title suggests: Jim James singing aaahs and ohhhs between verses as the band rocks around him. It's as if the entire album, not just this song, could be stripped of literal meaning, as if everything My Morning Jacket needs to say can be communicated exclusively through sound. And it works, especially at the end of ""Wordless Chorus"", when James breaks into a rapturous r&b yowl that recalls the Passion of the Prince. But My Morning Jacket does have something to say. Zis a spiritual album-- or at least Side One is-- with references to religion and a few barely veiled allusions to Jesus Christ himself. ""Religion should appeal to the hearts of the young,"" James sings on ""Gideon"", and guess who the bouncy ""What a Wonderful Man"" is about. Here's a hint: ""He was leading us through the dark/ He was saying that love goes on."" Even that title itself suggests an omega to some unknown alpha-- sex or death or both. These hints at larger meanings infuse the songs with a weird sense of questing adventure, as if the band is revealing its secrets only to present even more riddles. Side Two, however, loses much of the strange steam that fuels Side One, struggling to find its momentum and bringing the album back to reality with pedestrian problems like pacing. Following ""Off the Record"", ""Into the Woods"" breaks that spell, making everything that comes after it sound a little pale and less immediate. A dark-carnival organ sets the sideshow stage for James to sing about burning kittens and babies in blenders, and the overly literal production inserts a me-oww and a wahhh into the mix, Spike Jones-style. It sounds markedly better when the band comes in halfway through, but the song still dawdles to a conclusion. As if to apologize for ""Into the Woods"", ""Anytime"" is straightforward rock, enlivened by a pogoing guitar riff and James singing himself ragged. Disregarding its low-lying bass and piano lines, ""Lay Low"" rises to a blandly grandstanding jam as if on autopilot, but ""Knot Comes Loose"" ambles along on Koster's fluttering piano rhythms. Fortunately, Z ends with the intense, simmering ""Dondante"". Backed only by a casually insistent rhythm section and a barely-there guitar, James sings as if in ecstasy, before the song explodes unexpectedly into a big, desperate chorus that sounds quintessentially My Morning Jacket. Then the song simply fades out-- but extremely slowly-- into several seconds of still silence. I like to think that the vinyl edition would loop that silence like Sgt. Pepper's, posing an answer to the album's question: What comes after Z?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16943-z/,"ATO,Red",2005.0
404,David Bowie,David Live,Rock,7.7,September 20 2005,Michael Idov,,"David Bowie is not a man one would expect to revel in the accidental. It is as much of a cliché to divine cold strategy in his every move as it is to pretend that strategy didn't exist for, say, Janis Joplin. For those preferring to see Bowie as a contortionist auto-Svengali, the main revelation of the reissued live albums David Live and Stage will be how unafraid of imperfections he could be. These panoramic snapshots of 1970s Bowie (David Live came out in 1974, with Stage following mere four years later) mostly sound-- surprise-- like a good rock band at work, not a collection of virtuoso day laborers supplicating at the feet of the Artiste. For one thing, the singing remains gloriously unsweetened, not by studio overdubs for the original release nor by digital trickery-- save a spit polish of the highs and fattening of the lows-- this time. Bowie's is not exactly a golden throat, but by the mid-70s he could will his untrained voice into a soulful squeal, a come-hither lounge croon, and so on; he misses some notes but never the dramatic pitch of the line. He also used to be one of those singers who need half a set to get entirely comfortable on stage, and, as a result, Disc Two of both David Live and Stage is the stronger one by far. If by the beginning of each concert, Bowie simply performs the songs, by the end he is twisting them into entirely new creatures. David Live contains arguably the all-time greatest display of Bowie's voice as he lets loose on an r&b; version of ""Rock'n'Roll Suicide"", festooned with James Brownian stops, croaks, pregnant pauses, and beat-chasing rephrasings, as well as a completely sudden detonation of a very, very high falsetto. Both albums start, predictably, with some selections from albums Bowie was promoting at the time-- Diamond Dogs and Heroes, respectively, before launching into a great big chunk of Ziggy Stardust. Interestingly enough, there are no overlaps here (name another '70s rock act that produced two 22-song concert sets in four years without repeating a single number), but an almost-complete live version of Ziggy can be put together by combining the two, if desired. In the battle of the openers, Stage wins-- the damp gloom of ""Warszawa"" easily trumps the glam doom of ""1984"". David Live is a more genial album, as its title indicates. It's loaded with Diamond Dogs material-- nobody's favorite Bowie album-- but works hard to ingratiate itself: there's ""Space Oddity"", ""Changes"", ""Jean Genie"", ""All The Young Dudes"". What a difference four years and a move to Berlin make: David of Stage doesn't appear to be the least bit concerned with what you'll think of it, or him. Recorded between Low and Lodger-- in the odd period that found the singer at his gauntest and most ashen-faced, listlessly flirting with Aryan imagery and ignoring the verse-chorus song form-- Stage is a challenging and idiosyncratic set. Some of the risks don't quite pay off: The cover of ""Alabama Song"" is just a bad idea through and through, its original Weillness matted with Jim Morrisson's greasy fingerprints. And some do-- the colossal trifecta of Station To Station's eponymous track, ""Stay"" and ""TVC 15"" comprise a powerful (and punishing) 20-minute concert-closing gambit. It's just like Bowie, of course, to make two mutually exclusive modes of engaging the arena-- as a party palace and as a horror-movie science lab-- fit together in a remarkably cohesive whole.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11681-david-live-stage/,"Ryko,Ryko,Ryko,Ryko",1974.0
405,Eazy-E,Eternal E: Gangsta Memorial Edition,Rap,8.0,September 18 2005,Sean Fennessey,Contributor,"For a while, Eric Wright was just about the most despicable man in rap. He never produced a beat. He rarely wrote his own lyrics, daringly saying as much well before Diddy flossed his checkbook. He had a distinctive voice but a patchwork flow. He was the most vital architect of gangster shit, bane of the backpack. He stole from his own posse. He dealt far more misogyny to the masses than crack, but reveled in both. And he preached gunclapping as the apex of problem-solving. Like I said, a pretty vile guy. But holy shit is he eminently listenable. On this reissued and expanded compilation, we get a taste of a man with no vulnerability, no conscience, and a truckload of everlasting iconography. A former dope dealer, Eazy-E, dressed all in black L.A. Kings gear and dark shades and carrying an automatic rifle he'd never shot in his life, brought more to the future of virulent hip-hop than almost any other figure. In 1987, he teamed with nefariously depicted white dude Jerry Heller. They soon formed Ruthless Records and assembled N.W.A. Two years later, the group unleashed Straight Outta Compton, razing and raising the West Coast. His solo career is a less-traveled, oft-forgotten road, something many of the South's biggest, youngest burners swear by. I suppose it's difficult to ignore the rampant ho-cizing and gat-gripping that runs through every single song the diminutive Eazy ever recorded. At the root of the ""Whisper Song""'s bachanalia, I point you in the direction of Eazy, a man who regularly said things like ""Took her to the backroom, about to jack/ Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back."" This a guy who lauded sex at gun point. Cute, right? If there's something truly enthusiastic to be said for Eternal E it's the quaking, slithery power on the 11 Dr. Dre-produced joints here. A few years before he morphed into that shadowy monster he is now, Dre was just the smiley guy in black jeans spitting Cube's writtens and slashing Parliament and Charles Wright samples. Dre's early N.W.A. production, the skittish first third of his remarkable career, was rivaled only by the Bomb Squad, the Dust Brothers, and DJ Premier in cohesion and pure gliding funk. It was a natural fit for the energetic Eazy. His notoriously squeaky chirp was best utilized on story songs like MC Ren's ""Nobody Move"", ""Boyz-N-Tha-Hood"", and ""No More ?'s""-- all included here. The latter two were written by Ice Cube and it shows. Cube rarely got this lewd, but the vitriol is instantly recognizable. Eazy, a scoundrel, wore it well. Eight of the 17 tracks here, the eight best tracks, are culled from his seminal solo debut Eazy-Duz-It. Offerings from N.W.A.'s Efil4zaggin, like the crooned ""I'd Rather Fuck You"" and jovially revolting ""Automobile"" break up the hardened glares, but replace them with dickish goofing off. ""Real Motherfuckin G's"" is one of the most overlooked diss records ever recorded wherein Eazy asks Dr. Dre of his new protégé Snoop Dogg ""Tell me where the fuck ya found a anorexic rapper?"" The biggest flaw here is a tack-on with Eazy's son, Lil Eazy, natch, falling far from the tree on ""A Lil Eazier Said"". Eazy may be best remembered for revolutionizing the viability of the rap villain, facing off against the KKK, the FBI, his own bandmates, and White America. Whether Al Capone-ing his way through videos with a Tommy Gun (nine arrestingly shot and cinematic clips are included on a special DVD), staring down the po-po, or pointing out the booty shake, Eazy propagated a mentality that has survived, even thrived, today. Before dying of complications from AIDS in 1995, Ruthless Records had spawned hits from Above the Law, MC Ren, and most alarmingly Cleveland's Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, which is the true legacy of Eazy's uncanny entrepreneurial skills. His music still grooves, but it's tough getting behind cats who pistol-whip for head.

406,Devendra Banhart,Cripple Crow,Folk/Country,8.4,September 12 2005,Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,"As ""freak-folk"" began to hit a stride last summer, Devendra Banhart's Golden Apples of the Sun compilation suggested a cogent introduction to the genre. A year later, Cripple Crow provides, in a sense, the loose-knit scene's strongest group effort to date. Banhart's fourth album isn't a compilation, nor is it billed as a group project, but he's assembled such a rich cast of cohorts here, it feels more like the fruit of community interaction than the product of a lone singer/songwriter. The communal vibe is hinted at by the album's artwork: Rather than adorning the cover with his usual calligraphic scribbles, Banhart offers a composite photo of ""The Family"" (a term he often ascribes to his musical friends), gathered beneath a large knotty tree and accompanied by the disembodied heads of smiling spirits. Sgt. Pepper is the obvious point of departure, though unlike the Beatles' classic, there are no numbered silhouettes in the liner notes to decode the relative anonymity of the photo subjects. Fittingly, the only immediately recognizable figure is Banhart himself, crouching front and center, wings spread wide. The artwork conjures Native America, an attribute Banhart seemingly alluded to in a recent email exchange, admitting that he's ""a little terrified at how white most of the people are,"" but reassuring me that ""68% of the people on the cover have Native American blood."" Indeed, Banhart strives for ethnic diversity on Cripple Crow, boasting the highest concentration of Spanish-sung tracks of any of his albums (he was raised in Venezuela where Spanish was his mother tongue), and finding him moving further beyond ""freak"" territory and into a worldly blend of various exotic approaches. Banhart has always experimented with method and sound, but he's never before approached Cripple Crow's expertise and variety. In all its obvious details, the album not only finds Banhart coming into his own as a songwriter and performer, but suggests future directions for the 24-year-old as well. Having started out on primitive recorders and four-track machines, Banhart only recently graduated to proper studios, and Cripple Crow further increases fidelity, possessing a warmer, more pristine quality. His vocals, too, often draped in slight reverb, are especially assured and less flaky than on previous outings. And as mentioned above, an ensemble cast showed up to back him: There's best chum Andy Cabic (aka Vetiver), Noah Georgeson (of Joanna Newsom's old rock band the Pleased, and producer of The Milk-Eyed Mender), and Thom Monohan (Pernice Brother and production whiz). The cast also includes members of Currituck Co., Espers, Yume Bitsu, The Blow, Feathers, CocoRosie, and others. Basically, it's a traveling band of hippies excited about Donovan who aren't afraid to rock. On Oh Me Oh My's ""Roots"", Banhart sang, ""I don't play rock 'n' roll."" All that's changed. Cripple Crow features an explosion of psychedelic R&R stuffs. ""Long Haired Child"" maneuvers a three-pronged guitar attack-- Adam Forkner's distorted noodling, Banhart's wah-wah, and acoustic coupling-- backed with Otto Hauser's drums and Jona Bechtolt's percussion. ""Lazy Butterfly"" is memorable for Cabic's closely mic'd backing vocals and a tambora sheen along with hand drums and guitars. And ""Little Boys"", which Banhart alleges is sung from the perspective of a schizophrenic Hermaphrodite, is divided in half by a mid-song bass change-up which shifts the song up from a sorta boring Oldham prom-dance lament to its sinister, surfy refrain: ""I see so many little boys I wanna marry/ I see plenty little kids I've yet to had."" Juxtaposed against a number of upbeat rock tracks, Banhart's quieter, more introspective material often makes a stronger impact. ""Dragonflies"", a whispered duet between Banhart and Matteah Baim of Metallic Falcons, flutters by in less than a minute with a cryptically tender lyricism. Likewise, album opener ""Now That I Know"" is one of his most beautiful and controlled tracks yet. It finds him backed only by cello and his own guitar, in confessional: ""12 years old/ In [my] mama's clothes/ Shut the blinds and lock up every door/ And if you hear someone's coming near/ Just close your eyes it'll make 'em disappear."" Elsewhere, on ""Heard Somebody Say"", there's a sense of protest, with Feathers' lovely vocals adding witch-hunt background layers. Banhart gently lays down the thesis-- ""Heard somebody say the war ended today/ But everybody knows it's going still""-- before winding around to the chill-inducing punchline, the easiest anti-war slogan ever: ""It's simple, we don't want to kill."" Later, he tries out Dylan rhyme schemes on ""I Feel Just Like a Child"", while ""Some People Ride the Wave"" is Louis Armstrong with New Orleans toy jazz (""some people write the songs that stay inside our souls""); ""The Beatles"" lets it be known that ""Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are the only Beatles in the world"" before shifting gears into Spanish; Pangea and various fertility myths are given new legs in ""Chinese Children""; and endless love song ""Korean Dogwood"" tells as thorough an elliptical story as Banhart's tackled. Banhart's ambition is apparent throughout, but at 22 tracks and almost 75 minutes, the album does stretch its legs too long. Though it feels like an attempt to document as thoroughly as possible his late winter retreat to Woodstock, any more experienced mystics will tell you that blanks, dissolves, gaps, and other ingredients for mystery could've made it even richer. Still, Cripple Crow is undoubtedly impressive, vastly singular but entirely accessible, and an inspired listening experience where Banhart again proves himself one of the more talented and charismatic forces in modern music.

407,Johnny Cash,The Legend,Folk/Country,9.0,August 11 2005,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"America likes its heroes to bleed of-the-dirt ""authenticity""-- to carry a bible and have spent time in jail, to struggle with fidelity and caw about murder and remorse. Consequently, the box set section of most American record stores currently boasts a big, black mess of Johnny Cash-themed cubes. Posthumous marketing is particularly vicious: The Original Sun Albums, Unearthed, Man in Black, and now the four-disc The Legend bang corners, demanding further canonization, tapping persistently at our shoulders and wallets. Still, the diversity of the Cash shopping spectrum is oddly apt: Both in-store and out, there are loads of different Cash archetypes to choose from. Check Outlaw Cash, with his middle finger shooting heavenward, face scrunched into anti-authoritarian glee, invading prison yards and calmly bellowing, ""I shot a man in Reno/ Just to watch him die."" Conjure Country Cash, standing alongside Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, eyes hard, shaking his head at Nashville's pop-evolution. Note Family Cash, devoutly religious, wanting to record gospel songs with Sam Phillips, curling into June, and praying to be faithful. Or watch Neo-Cash lock arms with Rick Rubin, inadvertently charming the PBR-and-Pumas set with loads of quasi-ironic covers. It's only logical, then, that The Legend is all-Cash in all forms. It's the most comprehensive Cash box released to date, covering nearly a half-century (1955-2002) of song, parsing his discography into four logically-titled discs: ""Win, Place and Show: The Hits"", which gathers radio favorites, ""Old Favorites and New"", all classic Cash, ""The Great American Songbook"", which sees Cash tackling traditional cuts, and ""Family and Friends"", two dozen collaborative cuts. The Legend is being released by Columbia, and unsurprisingly, focuses more heavily on Cash's Columbia work than his early Sun recordings. Regardless, its four discs expertly showcase the astonishing scope of Cash's talent: ranging from goofy, 1950s teen dance-pop (""Ballad of a Teenage Queen"", ""Guess Things Happen That Way"") to gospel (""Were You There (When They Crucified My Lord)"", with the Carter Family) to traditional Americana standards (""I've Been Working on the Railroad"", ""Streets of Laredo""). The breadth of Cash's songbook almost justifies the dozens of roles he's been hustled into over the last 50 years-- and with seven previously unreleased songs, dug up from tapes in a backroom at the House of Cash, devotees are sure to start rethinking all other boxes crowding their shelves. Cash recorded his first single for Sun in 1955 (""Hey, Porter"" / ""Cry, Cry, Cry""), featuring Marshall Grant on bass and Luther Perkins on guitar (then known as the Tennessee Two, and later, after W.S. Holland, one of country music's very first drummers, joined the lineup, as the Tennessee Three). But it wasn't until 1956, with the release of ""I Walk the Line"", a dutiful promise of loyalty to then-wife Vivian Liberto, that Cash managed to snag a hit. Appropriately, ""I Walk the Line"" opens the first disc of The Legend, its meandering guitar line interrupted by Cash's tinny humming, pitter-patter percussion, and that voice: Soul and gravity were hard-wired into Johnny Cash's pipes. Rumbling and shockingly understated, Cash's deep, belly-blows sound like divine direction, all confidence and purity. The effects are transformative: Imagine ""Ring of Fire"" sung karaoke-style, and then reconsider how Cash's grim nonchalance pushes the song to new levels of weird profundity, a sober counterpart to its yapping horns and jiggly rhythms. Disc One corrals all of Cash's proper hits, making for a monstrous party record; Disc Two offers up a less cohesive collection (herded in under the vague heading ""Old Favorites and New""), but manages some impressive transitions. Cash's rendition of ""Long Black Veil"" (also attempted by Joan Baez, David Allen Coe, Marianne Faithful, the Band, and Bobby Bare) is properly captivating: when Cash gets to the ""me"" in ""The slayer who ran/ Looked a lot like me,"" his voice presses delicately but firmly, guaranteeing loads of jittery chills. Disc Two also harbors three previously unissued tracks, the best of which falls first: ""Doin' My Time"" is a pert, swinging ode to proper imprisonment, complete with guitar solo and courthouse laments. Disc Three is packed with American classics, including a handful of Leadbelly songs (collected by Alan Lomax, of course), some Jimmie Rodgers, and plenty of Traditional cuts. Disc Four, which includes a mess of duets (see Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Ray Charles, and others), has its questionable moments (Cash fronting U2 for ""The Wanderer"" is particularly gruesome), but closes with The Legend's prized jewel: ""It Takes One to Know Me"", written by Carlene Carter, June Carter Cash's daughter from her marriage to country star Carl Smith. Johnny attempted to record the song in 1977, as a duet with June, but left the song unfinished; Carlene's brother, John Carter Cash, agreed to produce the track, adding backing vocals by himself, his wife Laura, and his sister Carlene. ""It Takes One to Know Me"" mixes pristine, swelling strings with schmaltzy piano and guitar, but the vocals are mind-blowingly gritty: June and Johnny croon in perfect imperfect harmony, vowing earnest devotion to each other, acknowledging all the knots inherent to matrimony. The results are hauntingly real. People tend to discuss Johnny Cash with grave, unbridled reverence, which is appropriate but awkward: His website (which bursts open with a booming ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash, welcome to JohnnyCash.com!"", a proclamation just loud and weird enough to knock you off your chair), compares ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" to ""In God We Trust"", claiming both ""resonate throughout the world"" and ""stand the test of time."" The liner notes to The Legend boast that in 1969, Muhammad Ali and Johnny Cash were the best-known people on the planet. Cash's prominence may have wilted slightly in the past 35 years, but not significantly, and The Legend. should only confirm Cash's American Hero cred-- not as some presupposed ""authentic,"" but as an astoundingly multi-talented songwriter.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1333-the-legend/,Columbia,2005.0
408,Michael Jackson,The Essential Michael Jackson,Pop/R&B,8.7,August 8 2005,David Raposa,Contributor,"Eight thousand Michael Jackson fans-- the ones in the U.S. that actually bought this collection in its first week of release-- could be wrong, though I think it's more likely that the group outside of those 8K are the ones with the loose screws. After all, a two-disc best-of collection from a performer with more than 150 million records sold worldwide is bound to have better sales numbers than the latest volume of Now That's What I Call Music!. But the majority of those millions were sold years ago, before (most of) the plastic surgeries, the 30-foot statue floating down the Thames, the gold-plated baseball equipment, the crotch grabbing, the ethnic slurs, the baby dangling, and the countless accusations of child molestation. Suffice it to say that any pop capital Michael Jackson accrued during his reign as the self-appointed King of Pop has long been spent. However, as these two discs ably show, his honorarium was, for a time, actually justified. For most folk, Disc One might be more than enough MJ. The disc covers the meat of Jackson's career, starting with the Jackson 5, and ending with the title track from Thriller. Anyone that doesn't know ""ABC"" or ""I Want You Back"" must be deaf, and anyone that doesn't enjoy these songs must be dead. Pitchfork staffer Tom Breihan will be happy to know that ""The Love You Save"" is included-- it's the J5 #1 that never gets any play, and it might be the best of the bunch. Of course, as much as Jackson is all about the finger-snapping funky dance stuff, he's also about the treacly ballad, so instead of ""I'll Be There"", there's ""Got To Be There"", which really shouldn't be anywhere. And then there's ""Ben"", a song about a boy and his homicidal rat that touched the lives of both Crispin Glover and Eddie Vedder. Yay for the skip button, because right after that roadblock comes great unsung tracks from the Jacksons, like ""Blame It On the Boogie"", and the ubiquitous Quincy Jones collaborations that made Jackson a legend. The final 12 tracks of Disc One are comprised with cuts from Off The Wall and Thriller, including all seven Top Ten singles from the latter album. The importance of Thriller can't be understated, musically or otherwise-- 27x platinum in the U.S. alone, ushered in the age of milking albums for all they're worth, helped dimwits at MTV realize that having popular black artists on their nascent network might be a good idea, gave John Landis a chance to do more werewolf stuff-- but it's the Off The Wall tracks that shine brightest. The triple-threat of ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,"" ""Rock With You"", and ""Off The Wall"" hinted at the effortless pop hopscotch Jackson would execute on the next record. Thriller does manage to make the Beatles and heavy metal (and, um, monster movies) hold hands like BFFs-- no easy feat in the early 1980s, regardless of who's doing it-- but it could take years of distance and brainwashing for ""Beat It"" or ""Billie Jean"" to shake off their played-out flavor. Hearing ""Thriller"" away from the zombie chorus line is interesting, though, if only because one comes to realize that a song about being pursued by 40-eyed behemoths actually made CBS a boatload of cash. Of course, the title track's success came in the wake of a song that goes from a refrain of ""You're just a buffet/ You're a vegetable"" to a coda of tribal chanting, which goes to show how off-the-wall Thriller actually was. In light of what Disc One offers, Disc Two will invariably disappoint, just as the 8x platinum Bad was a disappointment in the wake of the unparalleled success of Thiller. With hindsight, it's hard not to see the songs from Bad in an unflattering light. As Tom B. noted in his write-up regarding the Michael Jackson box-set, this is where all the tics and affectations that people think of when they think of Michael Jackson came to roost-- not five seconds pass without an unwarranted ""shamon"" or ""hee-hee"" or hiccup or ""woo"". While Bad boasted more #1 hits than its predecessor-- ah, the joy of riding coattails-- most of the singles are just lesser versions of Thriller tracks. ""Bad"" is a beat-down ""Beat It"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is a tepid rehash of ""P.Y.T."", and the hamfisted seduction in ""Dirty Diana"" is light years from the alluring ambiguity of ""Billie Jean"". And then there's ""Man in the Mirror"", wherein the King reacquires his taste for schmaltzy sub-""Ben"" balladry, now cutting it with a need to ""make that change"" for the sake of the entire human race. It might be simply a matter of a failed negotiations, but it's no small blessing that ""We Are the World"" is far, far, far away from this collection. Unfortunately, no such boon kept the chirpy and grointastic ""Black Or White"" off the board. That said, the second disc does right by Jackson, culling quality tracks from the sparse smattering of original material that followed That Album, and all the non-musical nonsense that surrounded this music. Without such selectivity, an interested novice would be better served just grabbing Off The Wall and Thriller. Instead, Bad's gorgeous ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" and neglected Dangerous single ""In The Closet"" receive their deserved moment. Even the DOA single from his latest album, ""You Rock My World"", sounds surprisingly spry. Being far removed from that awful video featuring Marlon Brando's corpse and Michael Tucker as Mini-MJ helps, just as getting the hell away from Iman and Eddie Murphy does wonders for ""Remember the Time"". Therein lies the rub of Jackson's career-- as fantastic a performer, songwriter, and singer he is, people at large are going to remember Michael Jackson more for his Wacko Jacko public persona than for his exemplary body of work. Given recent events, the backlash is understandable, but in regards to the actual music being offered here, it's a damn shame.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4351-the-essential-michael-jackson/,Sony,2005.0
409,Funkadelic,Funkadelic,"Pop/R&B,Rock",9.0,August 3 2005,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Funkadelic, arguably the greatest ""black rock"" band ever...Actually, strike that, they are far and away the best black rock band ever. In fact, screw everything, they're one of the greatest rock bands period, up there with any classic rock dinosaur you care to name. And though it's tempting to launch an essay on the racism of rock radio-- or rock journalism for that matter-- I'll stick to the band. Even as they're revered as legends and purveyors of the some of the best funk of the 70s, I've read relatively few accounts on their greatness as a pure rock band. But they had it all: great players, great singers, a great look, a great concept, actual hits, great albums, great drugs, freaky sex, disputes over money-- everything Led Zeppelin (or Spinal Tap) taught us was necessary to make the world's greatest rock music. They started small, backing up ringleader George Clinton's Parliaments in the late 60s. When Clinton got into arguments with his label Revilot over money and rights, he decided to start recording his backup band instead, using the original Parliaments singers (Clinton, Ray Davis, Clarence ""Fuzzy"" Haskins-- and come on, dude's name is ""Fuzzy""-- Calvin Simon and Grady Thomas) as ""guests."" Guitarists Eddie Hazel and Tawl Ross, bassist Billy Nelson, drummer Tiki Fulwood, and eventually, master keyboardist Bernie Worrell were the band that would turn this fairly traditional soul group into the intense live act that wowed Detroit's Westbound Records head Armen Boladian. He signed them, and from the get-go, their music cut through genres and money bullshit like neither had ever existed. Never mind that half the band quit and came back again during recording sessions for their first record, Funkadelic was destined for greatness. Ace's reissues of the band's Westbound catalog is long overdue-- they sound a world better than the terribly mastered original CD pressings, and contain a wealth of bonus tracks, alternate mixes, and liner notes. Funkadelic from 1970 was a bomb dropped all over rock and soul. No matter Hendrix, no matter James Brown, no matter the MC5, nobody had ever heard anything like this. This music was slower than sludge, dirtier than the ""raw funk"" Herb ""Sparky"" Sparkman talks about in ""Music For My Mother"". It was a great big fucking mess, and a lot of people didn't know what to make of it. I remember reading a Rolling Stone review from the time that ended with ""who needs this shit?"" and a writer from the Blues & Soul 'zine from a year later admitted, ""Funkadelic has never been one of my favorite R&B; acts"". Still, the record sold (peaking at #16 on the Soul LPs chart), and planted the seed of a cult worship that would balloon in the latter half of the decade, making the P-Funk enterprise the most successful soul act on the planet. ""Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?"" started out with the sound of Clinton's wet mouth and the best ever opening line for an album: ""If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky emotions."" When the beat hits with Hazel's guitar line, there can be no doubt that Funkadelic were without peer as far as this stuff was concerned. This stuff-- hell, tunes like ""Mommy"" and ""Good Old Music"" are slams to the gut as powerful as anything Zep ever did, and with beats to spare. ""Music For My Mother"" is like a Southern myth, detailing a loner's travels through ""Keep Runnin' Mississippi"", hearing music he thought long dead, yet getting trapped by its sticky black allure. ""What Is Soul?"" drops more classic lines (""soul is a hamhock in your cornflakes,"" ""Soul is chitlins foo young,"" ""soul is a joint rolled in toilet paper"") in seven minutes than most bands muster up in a career. Bonus tracks like the tight instrumental ""As Good As I Can Feel"" and several single versions of album cuts make this album one of the most indispensable of all indispensable Funkadelic records. Even as Funkadelic was an inspired statement, it wasn't exactly a coherent one, especially as most of the band had quit and come back again during the recording sessions. Their second record, 1971's Free Your Mind was the first (of only two) records done by the core unit from start to finish-- albeit, according to Clinton, one recorded in the span of a single day, while everyone was tripping. Compared to the debut, it's a lot more ""rock"" and a little less ""soul."" The opening track ""Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow"" was like a Sly Stone jam gone haywire, with fuzzed out guitar and bass, distorto-organ, and spoken, chanted or otherwise freaked vox appearing all over the mix. ""Friday Night, August 14th"", ""Funky Dollar Bill"", and ""I Wanna Know If It's Good to You"" were a bit tighter, and a lot harder. ""Funky Dollar Bill"" features another down-home-on-a-porch-and-an-amp-with-probably-some-pot-and-other-things guitar riff from Hazel and Clinton and company sounding completely fucked up and screaming out at you from the depths of the stereo on lines like ""you don't buy a life, you live a life, a father learns much too late-- HE WAS A-NEVER HOME!!"" ""Euology and Light"" is like a lysergic Lord's Prayer, replete with backwards choir. The bonus track ""Fish, Chips and Sweat"" is again reminiscent of Sly, but in his ""Dance to the Music"" guise, and is suitably celebratory, even as the mix distorts the tape. And then they got serious: Maggot Brain, released in the July of the same year, is the peak of the Funkadelic experience. The songs jam harder, the way out stuff is way fucking out there. Seriously, how many dimensions is Hazel traveling through on the instrumental title cut? His 10-minute guitar soliloquy is a spiraling model of the blues filtered through a psychedelic lens, and almost single-handedly places him in a realm with Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and Eric Clapton as one of the great classic rock guitarists. But it got better: ""Super Stupid"" was the tale of a dumbass junkie set to a tune Black Sabbath would have been proud of; ""Hit It And Quit It"" is a funk anthem where keyboardist Worrell gets his licks in and the beat turns around a dozen times before we hit the chorus; ""Can You Get to That"" is honest-to-whoever pop that showed Funkadelic could be serious from time to time, especially when it came to social commentary (and also featured Isaac Hayes' female background singers, giving it a classic soul sheen), and ""Wars of Armageddon"" (recently, wisely used by Optimo on the Psyche Out mix) is a knock-out-drag-down fight to the death between the world's best rhythm section and paranoid, psychedelic sound effects and crowd sounds. Maggot Brain was an explosive record, bursting at the seams with exactly the kind of larger than life sound a band called Funkadelic should have made. Too bad most of the band left afterwards. Tiki Fulwood was fired due to drugs getting in the way of his reliability as a band member; Tawl Ross reportedly got into an ""acid eating contest, then snorting some raw speed, before completely flipping out,"" per Billy Nelson, and has not performed professionally since; Nelson himself quit over a money dispute with Clinton, leaving only Hazel and Worrell from the original Funkadelic lineup. Drummer Tyrone Lampkin replaced Fulwood, while guitarist Gary Shider (who'd already played with the band on parts of Maggot Brain) came aboard to fill out the sound. However, a lot of folks would look at former JBs like Phelps and William ""Bootsy"" Collins additions as the most significant. Certainly, Bootsy's mark on the whole Parliafunkadelicmint thang would eventually be almost as strong as Clinton's. Nevertheless, 1972's America Eats Its Young is a disparate, schizophrenic record. Despite Clinton's efforts to produce a record that would have a better chance at crossover appeal than the first three Funkadelic records, like many double LPs, there's simply too much material, and too many conflicting directions to really make this seem anything other than a Frankenstein production. Of course, it has its classics: ""Loose Booty"" and ""A Joyful Process"" are the two of the best pure funk songs the band ever did, while ""If You Don't Like the Effects, Don't Produce the Cause"", ""Biological Speculation"", ""Everybody Is Going to Make It This Time"", and ""Miss Lucifer's Love"" are great evidence of the band's strong pop bent even as their chosen subject matters could range from dark to disturbing to sci-fi. Tunes like ""I Call My Baby Pussycat"", ""Balance"", and ""Philmore"" even hark back to the more rock-oriented stuff of the first three records. However, it's hard to hear ""We Hurt Too"" (a maudlin ballad about the hidden tenderness of men) as anything but a joke, and the title track, similar to Maggot Brain's title cut, is a bit heavy on the huffing and panting. I think of this record as Funkadelic's White Album, containing too much great stuff to dismiss, but by almost anyone's standards, containing more than it needs. From here on out, Funkadelic would devote increasingly more time to maintaining and expanding their appeal. Albums like Let's Take It to the Stage and Standing on the Verge of Getting It on (also reissued, along with Tales of Kidd Funkadelic) were considerably less freaked-out than the early stuff, but alongside Parliament's concurrent music, helped turn Clinton's empire into one of the biggest acts in music. Still, I'll always love their first records the most. Call me rockist if you will, there's just something undeniably awesome about a funk band blasting guitar jams and telling me about neurotic bitches who want to take over the universe.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11739-funkadelic-free-your-mind-maggot-brain-america-eats-its-young/,"Westbound,Westbound,Westbound,Westbound,Westbound,Westbound,Westbound,Westbound",1970.0

411,Gorillaz,Demon Days,"Electronic,Rock",6.9,May 22 2005,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"Most musicians have their own toy boxes, the places they hide away all the obsessions and experiments that don't fit comfortably under the umbrella of their main projects. Compared to other artists', Damon Albarn's playroom chest must be filled to bursting: the cultural drawer cluttered with horror films, anime, and rock'n'roll stereotypes; the musical drawer crammed full of dub, hip-hop, dancehall, and afropop. In fact, Albarn seems to have so many creative distractions tempting his muse, he can't even keep them from occasionally invading the conservative environs of his day job-- each Blur album manages to squeeze in at least one ill-fitting endeavor like Think Tank's ""Crazy Beat"". Fortunately, Gorillaz provides Albarn an outlet to vent his taste for sci-fi kitsch, and satiate his urge to break free from rock with guitars-- and it's a surprisingly successful outlet, at that. (Did anyone really expect an edgy street-cred Banana Splits to be worth discussing four years into its discography?) Rather than falling flat, Gorillaz have strangely become a therapeutic and clever way for Albarn to subvert the usual egolympics associated with a solo project. Coyly hiding behind Jamie Hewlett's thick-inked pop caricatures and a phalanx of guest stars, Gorillaz allows Albarn to practice self-indulgence under heavy personality camouflage-- though never so heavy that there's any question as to who's really pulling the strings. Like the Gorillaz's self-titled debut, Demon Days goes the way of most auteur projects, its oversize idea load making for a trip equal parts peak and valley. But also like the debut, Demon Days is better than it has any right to be, featuring singles stronger than anything released under the Blur banner since, you know, that ""Woo-hoo"" song. For a project that could easily have been little more than Damon Albarn Remakes ""Ghost Town"" 15 Times (With More Rapping & Cartoons), this is a follow-up that proves Gorillaz, weirdly, has legs-- not that the four-year break hurt any. In order to keep things fresh, however, Albarn made a few exchanges at the hip-hop Wal-Mart, trading in his sputtering old Dan the Automator model for Danger ""as seen on CNN!"" Mouse, and swapping out Del tha Funkee Homosapien for MF Doom and... Dennis Hopper. These new collaborators add more to the proceedings than just increasing the comic-dork factor by about 10, particularly Danger Mouse, whose colorfully dense production helps buoy the occasionally slight genre sketches scripted by Albarn and his fleet of retro keyboards. For most of the album, Danger Mouse & Albarn make like they're Dario Argento & Goblin, to the point that this Fangoria neophyte can't tell the difference between the sampled zombie-flick scores and the facsimile ones (I'm pretty sure ""Last Living Souls"" is the former). Obviously, this agenda cues me to resort to adjectives like ""foreboding,"" ""ominous,"" and ""sinister,"" but Albarn can't help making his haunted house a discotheque. As with the standouts from the debut album, the best tracks here strike a unique balance between slacker detachment and dance-floor bounce: ""Feel Good Inc."" swerves through an anxious bassline to a choice De La Soul drive-by, while ""DARE"" defibrillates Shaun Ryder to shout along while Albarn channels Prince's synths and falsettos. Of course, there are a few blown-up test tubes amid the successful experiments, too: undercooked genre dalliances (the robo-punk ""White Light""), a few dull, unfortunately frontloaded Xanax lopes (""Kids With Guns"", ""O Green World""), and the truly bizarre (Hopper's once-is-enough spoken word on ""Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head""). Albarn also occasionally gets too distracted trying on the outfits of other bands, like on Beach Boys replicant ""Don't Get Lost in Heaven"", and fires his one radio dud with his second shrine to Clint Eastwood, a collaboration with Booty Brown and a children's choir called ""Dirty Harry"". On the album-closing title track, the appearance of a choir genuinely works, accomplishing the amazing task of being the second time (after ""Tender"") that Albarn has gotten away with effectively employing that ultimate lazy rock add-on. In fact, if the Gorillaz concept achieves anything beyond keeping Hewlett employed and producing some snazzy videos and websites, it's proving that Albarn can successfully wield the sonic toys he's mostly kept partitioned apart from his flesh band. Though the results of his exuberant mixing and matching are uneven at times, Albarn's obsessions fit together just often enough to again make Gorillaz more than mere Adult Swim novelty.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3526-demon-days/,Virgin,2005.0
412,My Morning Jacket,Chapter 1: The Sandworm Cometh,Rock,6.9,December 15 2004,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"If you're a My Morning Jacket fan, you likely know that the band have lots of unreleased material, old tapes, and reel-to-reels scattered around the silo propped against rusting farm equipment and crusted with the hardened wax of a thousand candles. And you probably figured out that unreleased material sounded rough and raw, all those songs saturated in reverb and tape hiss. And you knew scattered among that scattered archive-- long stepped over, or used as coasters for countless beers, or as ashtrays, or piled 10 high for footprops-- there were bound to be a few gems. You were, more or less, right all along, as these two mini-biographies from the band's original label, Darla Records, attest; both are subtitled ""early recordings, b-sides, covers, y mas"" (that's if I'm reading the scribbles along the spines correctly), which is an adequate product description, albeit one that omits a few live versions, several alternate takes, some half-assed doodles, tape experiments, and distractions on a bored Sunday afternoon. Most of these songs, as you could probably guess, feature just Jim James, the voice of My Morning Jacket, either strumming a guitar or playing rudimentary drum rhythms. He ostensibly compiled these tracks for Darla and divided them onto two separate disks. The first, Chapter 1: The Sandworm Cometh, almost has the easy flow of a proper album, beginning with the relatively polished ""Weeks Go By Like Days"", a full-band track from the Darla 100 comp and ending with a faithful cover of Elton John's ""Rocket Man"", which is particularly affecting here because James sounds like he's singing from the void of outer space. In between those two stellar tracks are alternate takes of ""They Ran"" and ""Evelyn Is Not Real"", which would end up My Morning Jacket's debut, The Tennessee Fire, with better arrangements; strong rarities like ""I Just Wanted to Be Your Friend""; some strange, short doodles (""What Will I Do?"" and ""Isobella With the White Umbrella""); a fuzzed-out version of Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit""; and, best of all, a ragged rendition of Santo & Johnny's ""Sleepwalk"" that leads into a live, slowed-down version of the Tennessee Fire track ""Olde Sept. Blues"". Surprisingly, the collection holds together remarkably well as you glimpse the band's creative process through its discarded recordings. Chapter 2: Learning is even more scattershot, both in its songs and in its tracklist. That subtitle is very likely a disclaimer, a tongue-in-cheek caveat to fans who might otherwise expect too much. The demo versions of album tracks like ""Just One Thing"" and ""Death Is the Easy Way"" anchor this volume, but other tracks uproot it. The three frontloaded covers are straightforward, but unlike ""Rocket Man"", they're also unimaginative and almost unlistenable. James peppers the band's straightlaced reading of Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"" with sound clips from Top Gun, which apparently passes for clever. That song is followed by an even greater disaster, an almost note-for-note cover of ""West End Girls"", on which James mimics Neil Tennant's half-spoken delivery without displaying the slightest awareness of the Pet Shop Boys' devastating decadence. But covers are half-serious undertakings anyway, especially on a hodgepodge compilation like this, and besides, James' rendition of ""Dream a Little Dream"" is almost charming-- that is, until he starts puppy-whimpering at the end. Similarly, the full-band version of Hank Williams' ""Why Don't You Love Me"" is a hoot until the drum solo coda, which in the liner notes James calls ""Hot!"" but which might be better described as ""Incredibly annoying!"" This percussive sound spoils ""Nothing 2 Me"" as well, burying a signature My Morning Jacket melody under six feet of reverby drums. This sort of self-sabotage can often sound fascinating if it serves a larger purpose, but here it sounds self-indulgent, juvenile, and-- quite frankly-- openly hostile, as if James is daring you to keep listening. Granted, he gives you good reason to endure all the shrill noise with songs like the live version of ""Bermuda Highway"" and ""I Will Be There When You Die/Sunrides and the Girls Scream"", but that only seems to make the lesser songs all the more grating. At their worst-- which is much of Learning-- these two hodgepodge volumes will interest only the die-hardest of fans, those who probably already own the Darla comps and the European-only EPs. But at their best-- which is most of The Sandworm Cometh-- they offer a compelling if not altogether listenable chronicle of a band with an already prickly creativity and only a nascent idea of what works and what doesn't. Taken together, they're about what you might expect from My Morning Jacket's early stuff, give or take.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11780-chapter-1-the-sandworm-cometh-chapter-2-learning/,"Darla,Darla",2004.0
413,Nas,Street's Disciple,Rap,7.2,December 5 2004,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"I'm as big a fan of tableau vivant as the next, but what the fuck is going on with the cover of Street's Disciple? The Last Supper?! Nas is a prophet, check, but the Jesus Christ of hip-hop? Then there's that poor sonuvabitch in the white. Didn't he read The DaVinci Code? Doesn't he know he's standing in for Mary Magdalene, a prostitute? Does he not understand how stupid he looks wearing a crucifix to The Last Supper?! This may be the most unintentionally hilarious ""intentionally hilarious"" album cover I have ever seen. Nas practically needed two discs to back this sort of shit up, which is perhaps one reason why Street's Disciple does the dirty double, with the first disc (purportedly) for the street, and the second one (purportedly) for the home. Sounds gimmicky-- and yes, it's ""sprawling,"" ""massive,"" ""has lots of filler,"" ""should have been one disc,"" etc.-- but guess what: It's cocksure and it works. Relatively speaking, Nas is an old guy now. He doesn't rob banks; he has babies and marries Kelis. He doesn't narrate ghetto life in the glorious present; he reminisces and takes stabs at reform. He no longer needs to prove himself; he just has to flow. Throughout Street's Disciple, Nas simply sounds confident, which is the key to pulling off tracks so thematically un-gangsta: When your best-known lyric is ""I never sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death,"" it can be tough to sell a line like, ""It was my night to watch my little girl."" ""This ain't no sucka for love shit/ This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hugs shit/ First night we fuck shit and don't call the next day,"" says Nas on ""Getting Married"". In Nas' hands, the institution becomes an avatar of badassness, much like faith becomes-- to faith's chagrin-- a vehicle for bravado on the Barry White-sampling ""Nazareth Savage"" (""I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen""), or as education advocacy oddly becomes the new thug ideal on ""War"" (""Tell my daughter try her hardest so the best schools'll take her in""). Nas hasn't mellowed on the mic; he just has different priorities-- and impressively, he doesn't eschew the present for the sake of his dated guns-drawn Queensbridge persona. ""Live Now"" most powerfully sums up Nas' street-tough-to-hubby transformation. Here, Nas describes his death-- not by bullets and rap romanticism, but by old age: ""My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me... Trying to say something/ The whole room'll quiet down just to hear my last words."" Yet, in the same song, as if to counterbalance that tenderness, he anxiously rehashes his past: ""Admit I did live it a little bit/ Sweet pickle dick, freaks licked on it/ Lips I dripped on it/ Sex I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits."" The rhyme feels forced, but maybe pointedly so. Nas realizes hip-hop doesn't like the sissy, and he's careful to balance such personal affairs with the requisite bravado. Nas obviously has no trouble here, and for the most part, Chucky Thompson, Salaam Remi, and L.E.S. front the boards hard and hookless, keeping the focus on the lyrics. Check ""Nazareth Savage"" (""I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the pus, get it?""), the token girls-I-fucked track ""Remember the Times"" (""Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick/ Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement""), or the previously released ""Thief's Theme"" (""Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd/ Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth""). The content is the same as before, but the vantage point is a rocking chair: Nas presents his past as been-there-done-that, an abridged backstory included as a contrast to his present affairs, and perhaps as a concession to some listeners: ""I had to make a song, speakin' on my old life/ For the thieves who come out at night."" The streets are paved with rags-to-riches rappers, but few of them keep the dirt on their shoulder after MTV and the first cool mill. If the Nas of Illmatic was fighting to get Nas out of the ghetto, the Nas of Street's Disciple is fighting to get the ghetto out of the ghetto. The Q-Tip-produced ""American Way"" is politically untimely but fiery, with Nas bemoaning the black vote's impotence, and at one point calling Condoleeza Rice a ""coon Uncle Tom fool."" On the equally vicious ""These Are Our Heroes"", Nas sarcastically salutes ""the coons on UPN9 and WB/ Who 'Yes, master' on TV,"" and calls out Tiger Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., and ""Mr. Goody Two-Shoes"" Jay-Z for selfishness: ""What you doin' for the hood?"" The carps aren't novel-- as Nas points out, ""It's trendy to be the conscious MC/ But next year, who knows what we'll see?""-- but carry unusual weight from the Queensbridge darling. Street's Disciple shares in the missteps we can expect from both double-disc sets and Nas albums in general (a fair number of shitty beats, and the occasional bomb like ""I'm the disciple of music!""), but there's a compelling record in here somewhere, and that album is easily Nas' best in years. For the past decade, he's tried to prove he can thug with the best; now unconcerned, he's caught a fresh breath. Street's Disciple is flawed, but Nas' second wave of confidence is one of the most exciting things to happen to hip-hop this year.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5711-streets-disciple/,Columbia,2004.0
414,Nirvana,With the Lights Out,Rock,6.3,November 23 2004,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Above my desk I have a postcard-sized picture of Kurt Cobain, a garish, iconic (and, appropriately, ironic) portrait on black velvet that someone gave me as a birthday gift a long time ago. Recently, my 13-year old brother-in-law pointed at it and asked, ""Who is that?"" I told him it was Kurt Cobain. ""You know, the lead singer of Nirvana."" This kid is a music fan. He digs Eminem, Jay-Z, and Kanye West, in particular, but Linkin Park and P.O.D. are also in the mix. He'd never heard of Nirvana. Journalist Neil Strauss tells a similar story in the book included with this odds 'n' sods box set, of polling teenagers in a California record store and realizing only about a third of them had knowledge of Cobain & Co. Usually, this sort of unscientific rock crit device involves bands like The Replacements and is meant to demonstrate that, despite perceived greatness among fans, the group in question was denied access to the big time. But Nirvana was the global rock band for a few years not so long ago, so if it's true that Generation Z is ambivalent at best, well, that seems a little strange-- especially considering how much every popular American rock band-- the P.O.D.s and Linkin Parks, for example-- owe them. After allowing Nirvana to lie fallow for almost a decade following the release of the live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, and Courtney Love are now working to reverse this trend. A box set containing a promised mother lode of unreleased recordings was first discussed a few years ago, but it was delayed by legal squabbles. Eventually, Love was granted her wish to release an eponymous best-of complete with ""You Know You're Right"", considered the cream of the then-unreleased crop. Nirvana did little to bolster the band's legacy, though, and with its lone new song, the collection-- otherwise pulled from a tiny catalog-- was most often discussed to explain the appeal of illegal file-sharing. Now the long-awaited box arrives, bearing three music discs, a live DVD, notes by Strauss and Thurston Moore, a wonderfully obsessive recording history (though no discography), and ugly metallic packaging that would have made Cobain, an accomplished visual artist, throw up. Only nine of the set's 51 tracks have been previously released (though many have been bootlegged), and those are culled from B-sides and compilation appearances. It's a scruffy hodgepodge of solo acoustic and full-band demos, radio shots, and live recordings, hugely variable in terms of sound, songwriting, and performance quality. So, first, the bad news: Those hoping for a trove of overlooked gems will be disappointed, as too much of With the Lights Out sounds like nothing so much as a dull-edged instrument lifting flakes of material from the bottom of a barrel. Simply put, there's enough good stuff here for a solid single disc. Beyond padding the release to box-set length, why include a sub-Barlow stab at four-track tape manipulation (""Beans""), two versions of ""Polly"" to go with the four already released (every Nirvana record on Geffen except In Utero features this middling song), two demos of ""Rape Me"" showcasing Cobain at his self-conscious worst, and a number of live tracks that sound like they were recorded on overused speech cassettes? If tossed-off experiments and poorly recorded demos of familiar songs are fair game, one imagines the Nirvana vaults stretching into bottomless ""Dick's Picks"" infinity. Still, the live and demo overkill can't erase Cobain's status as a great songwriter and (usually) one of rock's best vocalists, so there's still a fair amount of content here to enjoy. ""If You Must"" and ""Pen Cap Chew"" immortalize pre-Bleach Nirvana as self-loathing, drop-tuned stoners-- endearing qualities that never quite disappeared from their better known recordings. ""Even in His Youth"" has that classic combination of short, tense verses with a defusing swoop of chorus. And 1991's ""Old Age"" is loose and midtempo, showing Cobain stretching himself melodically, breaking free of the clipped phrases and soft/loud style that was serving him so well at the time. Elsewhere, ""Verse Chorus Verse"" is a completely different song than the one released under the same name on the No Alternative compilation (that one was originally called ""Sappy"", and is also included here), but shows a similar easy restraint. The nine-minute instrumental jam on ""Scentless Apprentice"" was also worth rescuing, showing the lumbering riff monster Nirvana could summon when in the mood. Additionally, versions of four Leadbelly songs, including ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"", document Cobain's strange obsession with the early folk singer. Oddly, despite its big holiday marketing push, this is probably a set for the Nirvana fanatics in search of a complete picture of the band, particularly because many of its pleasures are purely historical. There's no definitive date on the horribly recorded rehearsal demo of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" but it's interesting to note that the structure of the song, down to the tiniest detail, was already complete. And Cobain's off-the-chain scream is completely exhilarating despite the bad sound. Same goes for ""Dive"", which remains powerful though the band is ragged and Cobain can't quite muster the vocal power of the Incesticide version. About 20 of these tracks are solo acoustic demos, offering a leering look into Cobain's creative process. One thing we learn is that he wasn't a good acoustic guitarist, at least not when he was sitting at home on whatever he was on. The sloppy strumming on ""Sliver"" and ""Pennyroyal Tea"" is distracting, but not nearly as disconcerting as the solo demo of ""Rape Me"", on which Cobain seems to be struggling to maintain consciousness. This is where the box set makes you feel a little gross, pawing through the musical equivalent of Cobain's journals, listening to things he never intended to release. The DVD, on the other hand, includes some more lighthearted voyeuristic moments that are the highlight of the box. The first nine tracks are given over to a 1988 rehearsal at Novoselic's mom's house, and it's a huge kick to see Cobain and Novoselic so young and goofy, hanging out with a few neighborhood dudes and jamming like any other local band. For whatever reason, Cobain sings facing a wall with his nose two inches from the simulated wood paneling. They have a ball with Zep (""Immigrant Song""), but then they bust out ""About a Girl"" and we remember that this is not your everyday garage band. When they crank up the strobe light and hold a bottle of Rainier up to the camera, it's adorable enough that you might feel inclined to hug somebody. Fittingly, most of the remainder of the DVD features pre-fame shows and miscellaneous tour footage; technically, it's generally of poor quality, but enjoyable nonetheless. Though With the Lights Out is in many respects unsatisfying and shows Geffen to be rudderless with their handling of the Nirvana legacy, in the end, it's nearly enough that it documents so much material we haven't heard a million times before. And despite the complete predictability and heavy-handedness of closing the set with the solo demo of ""All Apologies"", the effect is still emotionally devastating. When Cobain was numb on heroin he missed the comfort in being sad, and if nothing else, With the Lights Out brings us back to this nourishing place.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5811-with-the-lights-out/,Geffen,2004.0
415,The Beatles,"The Capitol Albums, Vol. 1",Rock,6.0,November 22 2004,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"I. What is this box set about? A. The set contains the first four American-version Beatles records, all from 1964, in mono and new stereo mixes. Meet the Beatles The Beatles' Second Album Something New Beatles '65 B. It also contains a 48-page booklet with notes by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn (The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions).
C. These albums have never been available on CD until now.
D. These albums have never been available in stereo in any format until now. They were remastered from the original Capitol master tapes. The stereo effect was actually produced by using the two original tracks of mono, compressing them and then adding some reverb. (i.e., these aren't actual ""stereo"" performances, but ""duophonic."") E. The albums are presented in miniature replicas of the original LP jackets. II. Is it worthwhile for Beatle fanatics? Casual fans? A. Since most fans have owned the British versions of the Beatles' albums for years, this set is most valuable to American fans who lived through Beatlemania, or as a curio to the rest of us.
B. The packaging seems hastily assembled. The CDs don't even come in inner sleeves, so they always fall out when you pick them up.
C. Casual fans would be better off sticking to the British albums (on EMI), as they contain most of this music in superior mixes. They also have the notable characteristic of being the records the Beatles wanted to make, unlike these Capitol-assembled compilations.
D. Nobody really needs to own ""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand"" twice-- owning the Past Masters sets takes care of all the non-album singles, and the British albums have the rest. III. Do the stereo mixes sound good? A. Remember, it's ""duophonic,"" not stereo. The Pet Sounds reissue from a few years ago is a much better example of presenting in stereo an album that was originally released in mono.
B. The Capitol mixes are filled with reverb. This gets annoying after a while, because all the vocals sound cavernous.
C. That said, the instrumental tracks are clearer. IV. Why did they only do this for these albums, and not the rest of the catalog? A. The existing Beatles' CD catalog hasn't been remastered because there is no need. The sound is good, especially considering when they were remastered (1987). They still sell well. There's no need to fix what isn't broken. B. That said, I'd love to hear a 24-bit treatment of the Beatles' records. Few bands deserve to be heard in optimal sound more than them. V. How do the individual albums hold up? A. Meet the Beatles There isn't a bad song on this record, with the possible exception of McCartney's ""Hold Me Tight"", which lacks a good melody, and features some of the least interesting lyrics in the Beatles' canon (""Hold me tight/ Tell me I'm the only one/ And then I might/ Never be the lonely one""? D'oh!). Leading off with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""I Saw Her Standing There"" leads to a slightly anti-climactic experience for the remainder of the record. I can't imagine ever listening to the mono versions of these songs again. But then, I can't really imagine playing these albums much anyway. B. The Beatles' Second Album Alright, that's not fair. There is some historical value to hearing this stuff. So, go history. ""She Loves You"" is still one of my favorite Beatles singles. Cover version war: Lennon singing ""Money"" and ""Please Mr. Postman"" towers over McCartney's ""Long Tall Sally"" and Harrison's ""Roll Over Beethoven"". However, just like the British edition of Beatles for Sale (1964), this album seems overrun with covers. C. Something New Now we're getting good: ""Things We Said Today"" and ""If I Fell"" are two of the best pre-Rubber Soul Beatle songs. ""And I Love Her"" also nods to the direction the band would take starting in 1965. And yet, Capitol thought ""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand"" complimented them well. Still, this seems like the most thoughtfully compiled of the Capitol albums. D. Beatles '65 And this is the most haphazardly compiled. ""I'm a Loser"", ""No Reply"", and ""I'll Follow the Sun"" stand up to the best early Beatles songs, but seem out of place on a record featuring ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Mr. Moonlight"", and ""Honey Don't"". ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"" has more reverb than any song I've ever heard. Okay, maybe not more than that last Acid Mothers Temple album, but close. Capitol kept releasing different versions of the Beatles' records until Sgt. Pepper's in 1967. According to some, the Beatles protested in 1966 by delivering the infamous ""butchered baby"" cover photo for Yesterday... And Today. If Capitol put that in the next box, I'd give an extra point just on principle. VI. Anything else? Not really. I'm giving this a 6 because while there's a lot of great music here, there's very little incentive for me to play it, and none of these albums compare favorably to their British counterparts. Oh well. Next up: McCartney's ready for some football.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1094-the-capitol-albums-vol-1/,Capitol,2004.0
416,Snoop Dogg,R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece,Rap,2.1,November 17 2004,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Snoop Dogg is old. He's not the same kid who turned up out of nowhere on ""Deep Cover"". He no longer possesses that menacing lean, that cool, dangerous charisma, that effortless way of just rapping through the beat like he was always a part of it and it was always a part of him. These days, he's that haggard-looking, vaguely creepy middle-ager who was in Starsky & Hutch, the ""P.I.M.P."" video, and some pornos. He's always hanging out with that pimp bishop guy. He says ""wizzle wizzle"" a lot. He comes out with an album every couple of years, and no one pays any attention because Dr. Dre doesn't have anything to do with it. Finally, with R&G;: The Masterpiece, Snoop seems to have realized he's not getting younger. Unfortunately, he's tackled this dilemma by recording lots of terrible seductive soul tracks. R&G; (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece is absolutely crammed with them-- a nearly endless amount (18 songs, 78 minutes). ""I want to get you alone so I can learn you a little better,"" he purrs on ""Stay"". ""Everything is beautiful/ Right down to ya cuticles,"" he coos on ""Perfect"". ""Flip the channel to Lifetime/ You stay on my mind even when I write rhymes,"" he growls on ""Promise I"". But somehow, it's hard to take Snoop's appreciation of the opposite sex seriously when the second track on the album, ""Can You Control Ya Hoe"", advocates violence against women more brutally than anything he's done since ""Bitches Ain't Shit"". But girl, you can watch Lifetime! R&G; is Snoop's first album for Star Trak, the label run by fallen-off hip-hop hitmakers the Neptunes, a duo who all but ruled international radio with dazzling sci-fi stomp-clap new wave beats, but who've been starving for hits ever since they switched up their style to overcooked Vegas schmaltz-- all bloopy bass and shuffling drums and swooshing keyboards and unbelievably obnoxious falsetto crooning. The production duo laced five of this album's songs, but their fingerprints are everywhere else here. R&G; has a unified sound, rare in hip-hop albums, but it's a sound based on tinkly pianos and noodly guitars and windchimes. It sounds something like The Black Eyed Peas if they tried to make a Barry White album, but with more falsetto warbling. Snoop's voice is still a cool, gravelly drawl, but he doesn't insinuate himself into the beat the way he once did. He pretty much just talks over the beats, seemingly barely aware of their presence. On their respective guest spots, Nelly and Daz easily outshine him. Snoop only comes to life on a handful of rough, club-friendly tracks, most notably ""Step Yo Game Up"", a Lil' Jon production that sounds just like circa-2000 Neptunes. It's one of the few moments on the album in which he sounds like a real adult, and not just a sad old man, washed up and worn down.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7788-rg-rhythm-gangsta-the-masterpiece/,"Geffen,Star Trak",2004.0
417,Pearl Jam,Rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003),Rock,5.9,November 16 2004,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"As many others have done this year, the other night I went to see the Pixies' reunion tour. Next week, the Nirvana box set is finally released, as is a new two-disc expanded version of Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral; Low's upcoming Sub Pop record kicks off with a track whose rhythm section and vocal melody sound like a miniature version of Alice in Chains; Q magazine named The Red Hot Chili Peppers the Best Act in the World Today at its 2004 awards show; TV commercials for Green Day's American Idiot reminds us that 10 years ago they released Dookie; and now Pearl Jam are lionized with the two-disc, 33-track, best-of album, Rearviewmirror. I'd be frightened that we're about to undergo a full-blown 90s alternarock revival-- an era depressingly and backhandedly praised as much for what it was not (e.g. the hair metal that it ""kicked out,"" or the nu-metal that some of it slowly morphed into) than the music it produced. But then, it never went away, did it? In recent years, Billy Corgan's Zwan, a reunited Jane's Addiction, the Scott Weiland-fronted Velvet Revolver, and the Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine mashup Audioslave have released records to varying degrees of commercial success. Prior to that, the nascent sounds of grunge remained among the dominant North American hard rock templates throughout the 90s and into this decade, living on in a lineage that extended from its Seattle roots through Bush and Candlebox to Creed and Nickleback. Oddly, Pearl Jam have remained a constant since the days when 120 Minutes graduated to Alternative Nation, transitioning from stadium fillers to one of American rock's largest and most beloved cult bands, a Grateful Dead for the great washed. After deftly turning their backs on fame just as much of the public seemed poised to turn on them, Pearl Jam cultivated the unwavering support of a cabal of devotees who followed the band across a string of studio albums that casual observers have likely forgotten-- No Code, Yield, Binaural, and Riot Act-- and the almost comical release of every live show from their 2000 tour, a move that, depending on your level of cynicism, was either a thank you or an unintentional fuck you to their lemmingesque fanbase. Musically, Pearl Jam slightly spiced up their sound over the course of a decade, adding a few Eastern-tinged delicacies and some garage-rock snackfood to their typical meat-and-potatoes diet. By the time Creed became a permanent fixture on late-90s rock radio, the Florida band sounded as much like Pearl Jam as, well, Pearl Jam themselves. Rearviewmirror divides the band's career into an ""up side"" and a ""down side""-- the former are the earnest rockers, the latter are the earnest ballads-- although the monikers would also have been appropriate had they arranged the record chronologically. The ""down side"" to Pearl Jam's career allowed many people to romanticize the group's shift away from the spotlight as one purely of choice, and the band has since been characterized by honesty, good intentions, and yeoman's work, the sort of qualities that often make for turgid, sometimes rote, faceless music. In truth, Pearl Jam were always planted squarely in the middle of the road. While Nirvana was characterized by punk's sound as much as its ethos, Soundgarden had one foot in contemporary metal, Smashing Pumpkins mixed 80s goth and new wave in with their glam, and Green Day, NIN, and the RHCP were clearly creatures of the post-punk era, Pearl Jam was always a classic rock band, the one alt-nation superstar that completely ignored both punk and its aftermath. Pearl Jam were all solos and riffs and lighters-aloft, arena-rock sentiment; like so many 60s rockers, they looked to the Asian sub-continent for their first flirtations with ""growth"" and ""maturity""; they even cuddled up to the ""right"" rock 'n' roll architects (Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Neil Young). To claim Pearl Jam as the greatest rock band of our time-- as many listeners and critics do-- is virtually a negation of the past 30 years of guitar-based music, a relieved sigh that the values of the 70s aren't completely lost. And... that works for a lot of people. Pearl Jam struck chords within listeners like few of their contemporaries. Those diehards probably looked at the Rearviewmirror tracklist and chuckled, wondering why it didn't include this rarity or that B-side (it does have a few key ones, e.g. ""Yellow Ledbetter"") or a handful of what the album rock stations used to call ""deep cuts."" This comp isn't for them, though; it's for the rest of us, and a lot of listeners will likely glance at it, wonder where the hell ""Crazy Mary"" is, and consider it a handy career-spanner-- all the Pearl Jam they'll ever need. If they buy it, those listeners will likely be surprised that-- despite some non-descript titles (""Corduroy"", ""Go"", ""Immortality"", the title track)-- they remember most of these tracks, and despite slipping well below the radar, the band has, in many ways, improved over the years. The record seemingly begins the same way as their debut, Ten, but this version of ""Once"" (like ""Alive"" and ""Black"") has been slightly re-mixed by Brendan O'Brien. Hardly radical and barely noticeable, the new versions buff the shine from the originals, actually improving three of the band's better, more melodic early tracks. On the album's first disc, the band's years of popularity-- through third album Vitalogy-- are only highlighted by the Singles track ""State of Love and Trust"" and the forceful ""Not For You"". A lot of the other big guns are better left unremembered: The five-against-one mutterings of ""Animal""; ""Evenflow"", ""Rearviewmirror"", and ""Go"" plod along, monuments to the appropriateness of the tag ""grunge""; ""Spin the Black Circle"" is their first step toward the clumsy romanticism of bygone days; and ""Jeremy"" remains as painful as ever. Perhaps that last track is only truly powerful when coupled with images of Vedder's emotive pantomimes, hard-scrawled title cards that say things like ""the serpent was subtil [sic]"" and ""90210"", or a shirtless boy both wrapped in the American flag and standing in front of a wall of flames and crouching in the woods in front of an overblown photo of a teeth-baring fox... On the up side, the garage-esque ""Do the Evolution"" is either over-the-top fun or completely ridiculous, depending on whether or not you believe Pearl Jam actually possess a sense of humor (in this case, I think it's the former), and ""I Got Shit"" (formerly ""I Got ID""), ""Save You"", and ""Hail, Hail"" have a few more shades than the gray of the band's grunge era. On the way down, things are also scattered. Like they do on the early rockers, Vedder's vocal diversions, tics, and lack of enunciation occasionally move from exaggerated emoting into self-parody (see, in particular, ""Given to Fly""). His voice is still the band's hallmark sound-- a mealy-mouthed, gravely style that influenced a decade of really, really shitty music-- and it's still fun to impersonate; unfortunately, on pain-wracked attempts to convey more universal emotions (the glib ""Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town"", the lyrical disaster ""Wishlist"", ""Better Man"", the awkward cover of ""Last Kiss""), it's not very fun to listen to. Even when Eddie's opening his mouth, the tunes are often excruciatingly drab dirges-- ""Immortality"" and ""Nothingman"" are the biggest offenders. (Yet ironically, the most overtly dirge-like track-- the almost mantra-esque, Eastern-tinged ""Who You Are""-- is one of the set's most effective.) Elsewhere, the patient ""Off He Goes"", ""Nothing As It Seems"", and ""Man of the Hour"" and the solipsistic ""I Am Mine"" all carry a more weathered, wise sense of self, and these tracks greatly upstage the more youthful and clumsy neo-emoisms of the band's better known songs-- in particular its ballads. In some ways, it makes sense that Pearl Jam are improving as they slip further from the gaze of contemporary listeners and into the neolithic caves of mid-70s classic rock. For all the harm it unwittingly did to rock radio-- and for as comical as it can be in its most unchecked moments-- Vedder's voice is powerful and can even be captivating. The more considered and time-tested tones it now carries fit the band's more subtle shading. In full ham-fisted stadium rock mode, Pearl Jam now oddly seem miles away from Nirvana, still the best of their one-time Seattle contemporaries. Instead, they're not-so-distant cousins to the denim brigade, the faceless 70s arena rockers who dutifully punched time clocks and produced no-nonsense, sometimes hook-filled rock. Today, Pearl Jam seems bruised, ever so slightly more adventurous, and, thanks to the devotion of their fans, they're afforded the chance to dress up as rock iconoclasts rather than take a slide toward VH1-ready adult contemporary balladry. It's like punk never happened.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6209-rearviewmirror-greatest-hits-1991-2003/,Sony,2004.0
418,Wu-Tang Clan,Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1,Rap,7.9,November 14 2004,Brian Howe,Contributor,"Wu-Tang Clan's iconic ""W"" emblem is indelibly seared on New York hip-hop. RZA's off-kilter, refracted beats-- his chilly minor-key strings, bombastic horns, and sampled film dialogue-- have become the template for NYC beatmakers, and countless Gotham MCs, if not shamelessly jacking Raekwon's ghetto Mafioso lexicon and hard-bitten cadences, have a least a couple Wuisms tucked away in their repertoire. Wu-Tang were among the first emcees to capitalize on New York's mythological qualities, inflating mundane street narratives to epic bildungsromans by couching them in the tropes of their beloved Kung Fu movies and Kurosawa's Wuxia interpretations. By reincarnating the philosophical allegories of ancient Asian drama in 20th century Staten Island (a.k.a. Shaolin), they created a rare music that could touch both thugs and suburban fantasy buffs, each on their own terms. It's been a while since we've received a unified statement from Shaolin, so a quick roll call's in order. The RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Digital: shogun and CEO, the bipolar spitter of metaphysical knowledge and shit-talking battle raps. Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa: the steely growlers ballasting the more flamboyant personalities like sandbags. Method Man: the larger-than-life MCaricature with a bottomless bag of catchphrases. Raekwon: arguably the inventor of organized crime rap, who was cutting and flipping rhymes like weight long before every street hustler began to imagine himself a mafia don. Ol' Dirty Bastard (RIP): a deranged parody of a soul singer, a profane, gaudy libido coming unglued. Ghostface Killah: a gifted storyteller weaving densely coded slang, crushed out heavenly in yellow Wallabies and Wu-Wear fleece. The GZA: a candid lyrical prodigy meting out devastatingly precise similes. And finally, U-God: the most esoteric member of the collective, sometimes a crowd-moving party rapper, other times a dextrous prose-spitter, spinning inscrutable word collages in a velvety baritone. Amid long-running rumors of a break-up, on July 17th, 2004, the dormant Wu reconvened at the Rock the Bells festival in San Bernadino, California, and committed to tape the 27 tracks that now constitute the career-spanning live retrospective Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1. Live hip-hop albums are rare, perhaps rightfully so: Hip-hop relies so heavily upon careful production techniques that live performances can be like tabloid photos of a sex symbols caught unawares on a trip to the beach: no make-up, cellulite showing. And how many times have you gone to a rap show only to wait three hours for half the group to appear and watch them walk off 20 minutes later? Miraculously, all nine original members showed up (plus a few auxiliary men, including Cappadonna). Even the famously erratic ODB was present, and even seemingly lucid, remembering all his lines and delivering them with charisma and flair. Dirty's recent passing is especially sad because it seemed as if he was finally getting his life back on track after all the drugs, rehab, incarcerations, and high-profile public meltdowns. Considering the unusual amount of restraint he shows here, it's a small but pleasant consolation that his final mark upon the world was so pristine. Regardless, each member of the Clan fell effortlessly into his role, and instead of the anonymous collective shout that live posse cuts can often become, the Wu skillfully traded lines and allowed individual members to shine, only occasionally merging into a monolithic roar that, interestingly enough, makes for a strong counterpoint to the solo verses. Disciples of the 36 Chambers's first six tracks are a medley from Wu-Tang's classic debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Beginning with RZA inciting the crowd to chant the group's name, the sampled voice describing Shaolin shadow-boxing that opens ""Bring Da Ruckus"" elicits an audience howl that persists until the song morphs into early single ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"", then onward through ""Clan in Da Front"", ""C.R.E.A.M."" (the most famous and obvious of Wu-Tang's many embedded acronyms-- e.g., ever notice that the oft-repeated lines ""Positive energy activates constant elevation"" and ""Protons electrons always cause explosions"" spell ""P.E.A.C.E.""?), ""Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit"", and ""Shame on a Nigga"". Wu-Tang's early work was their most skeletal and grimy, brimming with crackling electricity and an intuitive call-and-response factor, and the medley gets the crowd so amped that they could have coasted for the rest of the set. Rather, the Wu stay on point throughout, working through classics from Wu-Tang Forever (""Re-United"", ""It's Yourz"", ""Triumph"", etc.) with unremitting energy, peppering those cuts with more obscure favorites from their numerous solo albums. Raekwon turns in a faithful reproduction of ""Incarcerated Scarfaces""; his partner Ghost shines on ""Criminology"", ""Ghost Deini"", and a reworked version of ""Run"" that follows Cappadonna's original version of the same song. The GZA concisely recreates the first verse of his classic ""Liquid Swords""; Meth struts over crowd-pleasers like ""Ice Cream"" and ""Method Man""; Dirty checks in with remarkable performances of ""Brooklyn Zoo"", ""Dog S**t"", and ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"". Wisely, the Clan only break the furious momentum of their set a couple times to address the crowd (usually to remind them that they're witnessing an historical moment of ""real hip-hop, in its purest form""), and only draw two of the best songs from their somewhat diluted later work, ""Y'all Been Warned"" and the fizzy bounce track ""Gravel Pit"". It's also inspiring to hear prolific rappers who are entering a relative middle age outshine their younger imitators. On Disciples of the 36 Chambers, the Clan sounds hungry as ever, vicious and confident, and nowhere near depleted. Is the Wu about to make a big comeback? The signs are there: In his closing statements, RZA asks the crowd if they'd like to hear another Wu-Tang group album, a prospect that seemed lost to solo projects, acting roles, and deodorant commercials. The inquiry is met with a roar of undiluted enthusiasm. It isn't clear how Ol' Dirty Bastard's passing will effect any potential reunion plans-- it could either scupper them entirely, or galvanize the Clan to greater heights, as sudden tragedies are sometimes wont to do. Either way, I know I'll sorely miss one of the most ostentatious and original personalities in hip-hop, and Pitchfork's heartfelt condolences are extended to his friends, family, and fellow Killa Bees. To borrow a Dirty quote, the performance documented here is ""as high as Wu-Tang gets"", and it's comforting to know that the Dirt Dog got a final chance to bask in the spotlight that was both his lifeblood and his adversary.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8747-disciples-of-the-36-chambers-chapter-1/,Sanctuary,2004.0
419,Michael Jackson,The Ultimate Collection,Pop/R&B,8.0,November 14 2004,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"The last time Michael Jackson was arrested for child molestation, I was watching ""Access Hollywood"" or ""Entertainment Tonight"" or another one of those shows. Number Ones, Jackson's greatest hits collection, was due to drop the following week, and Jackson was making noises about how the arrest was all part of an attempt to sabotage his album sales. The district attorney or sheriff or whoever was on TV at some press conference; he mentioned Jackson's accusations and said, ""Like I would actually listen to that kind of music."" What kind of music was this guy talking about? The kind that's sold nearly 150 million records worldwide? The kind that still packs floors at weddings, clubs, and parties? Jackson might be a walking punchline these days, but he's also the most successful solo artist of all time, someone who's written and recorded a career's worth of unspeakably great songs. It's not like the guy had just arrested G.G. Allin or something. But then, Jackson has been less a pop star than a freaky curiosity for more than a decade. His 2001 album Invincible bricked, as did Number Ones, and it's hard to imagine The Ultimate Collection-- his new hits-and-rarities box set-- will fare much better in the current hostile climate. Jackson, of course, may be desperate for any sort of positive attention, any way to reclaim his legacy and remind the public that he reached a level of stratospheric fame on the strength of his music. And a lot of the music on The Ultimate Collection is pretty much perfect. The set starts on a ridiculously high note with The Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back"", an unbelievably giddy blast of infectious joy. We don't get a whole lot of other early Jackson 5 material (no ""The Love You Save"" or ""Going Back to Indiana""), but what we do get is spectacular. Interestingly, the set leans heavily on lesser known, later-period Jackson 5 tracks like ""Enjoy Yourself"" and ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"", which are similarly revelatory and impeccably produced elegant disco-soul pieces. It's fun to hear Jackson's voice progress from the joyous, energetic whoops of his early singles to the taut, clipped, more rhythmic style of his first collaborations with producer Quincy Jones, on a pair of surprisingly solid gospel-Broadway-funk tracks from the soundtrack to The Wiz. This partnership would lead to Off the Wall, for which Jones piled layer upon layer of glistening disco strings, itchy percolating guitars, twinkling synths, blasting horns, nasty funk bass, and sophisticated, intricate rhythms behind Jackson's fragile, chiffon voice, resulting in the single best pop album of the disco era. Four tracks from Off the Wall are included here, and all of them are breathtaking, particularly the swooping, ecstatic ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"". Jackson's next collaboration with Jones was, of course, Thriller, still among the best-selling albums of all time. The set's second disc is devoted to tracks from the Thriller era, including five songs from the album itself, as well as a shitty lite-funk demo version of ""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"". Thriller might be overly familiar, but most of its songs still hold up surprisingly well. ""The Girl Is Mine"", a duet with Paul McCartney, is straight-up M.O.R. vanilla bullshit (on which Jackson effortlessly outsings McCartney), but other songs remain great: the limber dance-funk of ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"", the glossy plastic bubblegum-metal of ""Beat It"", and especially the chilly, paranoid masterpiece ""Billie Jean"". Even more than Jackson's other Quincy Jones collaborations, ""Billie Jean"" sounds incredible on headphones. The pulsing, insistent bass, the spacey synth chimes, and the shivery descending strings perfectly support the adult Jackson's definitive vocal performance, a percussive pileup of freaked-out tics, yelps, moans, and hiccups. The second disc also includes a whole lot of utterly godawful rarities. ""Someone in the Dark"" is a maudlin faux-Broadway ballad from the E.T. soundtrack that includes a bewilderingly bizarre vocal cameo from the alien himself. It seems to be the exact moment that Jackson began to make the transition from exciting young pop star to neutered humanoid elf. We also get a solo demo version of ""We Are the World"" and ""We Are Here to Change the World""-- the theme from Jackson's incomprehensible 3-D Disney World sci-fi opus Captain EO. It's difficult to believe that someone thought these tracks were more worthy of inclusion than ""The Love You Save"". The set picks back up again on the third disc with six tracks from Bad, Jackson's final collaboration with Jones. Most of these tracks still sound great, especially the feverish, insistent ""Smooth Criminal"". By this point, his vocal style was pretty much dominated by tourettic tics, and this new approach meshes with Jones' more rhythmic synth-funk. Jackson's later collaborations never approached the chemistry of Jones and Jackson. On 1991's Dangerous, he worked with the then-cutting edge new jack swing producer Teddy Riley, who had produced major singles for smoother, cleaner singers like Bobby Brown and Guy's Aaron Hall. But Jackson sounds lost over the hard-edged breakbeats of ""Jam"" and the staccato keyboards of ""Remember the Time"", even though the two do find the right note on ""Who Is It (HIS Mix)"", a shivery, low-key dance track. Meanwhile, ""Black or White""-- never Jackson's finest moment, but Dangerous' biggest hit nonetheless-- inexplicably includes the Macaulay Culkin/George Wendt skit from the video. Nearly everything Jackson has done since is just terrible, making the fourth disc an unbearable slog. Oddly, the set excludes ""Scream"", Jackson's biggest hit of the past 10 years, leaning instead on the ballads from 1996's HIStory-- ""You Are Not Alone"" and ""Childhood (Theme from Free Willy 2)"". In comparison, the material from Invincible almost sounds good, with the album's title track riding a hard Rodney Jerkins beat, and a posthumous Biggie verse ProTooled in. Still, nothing from this era comes within a mile of touching Jackson's best material, and all of the previously unreleased material on the disc (about half the CD), is boring to the point of being unlistenable. The set also includes a DVD of a Dangerous-era concert in Bucharest, which is pretty funny. It's a dazzlingly elaborate Disney-style greatest hits revue, more memorable for the puppet skeletons that come out during ""Thriller"" or the angel that flies over the stage for ""Will You Be There"" than for the actual music. Jackson's dancing is still amazing, and the enormous, rapturous crowd is fun to watch, but it's hard to get around the weird gold codpiece thing Jackson wears for the first half of the show or the ridiculous homoerotic Teutonic dancers. If Jackson was hoping to call attention back to his music, and away from his inexplicable eccentricities, it's hard to believe he'd want to include this show. In fact, the whole set is pretty strange. The Ultimate Collection doesn't make a great career overview; there's just too much extraneous crap. It would have made a lot more sense to simply box up Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad in their entireties (it's not like these albums were bloated with filler) along with a disc of Jackson 5 and early solo material and maybe a DVD of videos and early TV appearances. The rarities and recent material drag the box down enormously, but it still does what might be its primary job: to remind us that Michael Jackson is one of the greatest pop stars of all time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4350-the-ultimate-collection/,Epic,2004.0
420,Depeche Mode,Remixes 81-04,"Electronic,Rock",5.9,November 4 2004,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"As far as I'm concerned, the remix enjoyed its commercial and artistic peak in 2003. R. Kelly's brilliant ""Ignition (Remix)"" was self-aware, witty, eminently danceable, and unerringly fun-- in short, everything the original ""Ignition"" was not. Kelly proved to John Barth-lovin' meta-geeks what pop and dance fans already knew: that remixes can, in fact, be more accessible and successful than the original singles and album cuts. Kelly broke the mold; with Remixes 81-04, Depeche Mode take credit for setting it. Yes, there's finally someone to blame for ""Beetlebum (Moby's Minimal House Mix)"" and Bush's Deconstructed! ""The remix story of Depeche Mode can be viewed as a history of the remix,"" Paul Morley crows in the liner notes, perhaps forgetting the whole of Jamaican music. But as this sprawling three-disc set attests, DM's relationship with the remix-- from the 12-inches of the band's putative Vince Clarke years to a new collaboration with one of the Cro-Magnons in Linkin Park-- is both long-term and encompasses everything from electro-dub to extended dance remixes to hip-hop to house. It stands to reason, then, that this compilation is frustratingly scattershot. Collectors may salivate over Adrian Sherwood's white noise-laden mix of ""Master and Servant"" (previously available only on a rare 1984 vinyl release), but casual fans-- who, incidentally, would otherwise be well advised to stay the fuck away-- might enjoy Air's typically chilled-out ""Home"" or the first five minutes of DM's own 1987 re-working of ""Never Let Me Down Again"". On the other hand, anyone with ears should avoid Danny Tenaglia's 12-minute ""I Feel Loved"", with its heavy-handed beats and endless echoey repetitions of the title lyric. In some cases, this record reminds us how technologically far remixes have come from the days of simply splicing and extending a song's break or adding a heavier foot to its bass (see: Daniel Miller's fine but rudimentary 1981 ""Just Can't Get Enough"" remix). Other extended 12-inches don't fair as well: ""Get the Balance Right"" is stretched like a Navigator with unremarkable instrumentals, and uber-producer Flood piles the worst elements of sophistipop balladry onto ""A Question of Lust"". Thankfully, at least a few of the remixes add some interesting twists, mirroring the shift over the past two decades toward artists using a remix to transform an original recording rather than just tweak it. DJ Shadow augments the emotional entreaty of ""Painkiller"" with classic soul samples and driving bass. Dave Clarke's ""Dream On"" builds upon gentle acoustic guitar arpeggios and fake strings with nary a hint of the original. A mix of ""In Your Room"" by Johnny Dollar and Portishead scratches and smolders like vintage mid-1990s trip-hop (it was released in 1994, after all). Not all of the more transformative remixes succeed, however. Although DJ Muggs' ""Freelove"" mix is ultimately flawed, its hard-edged, guitar-based approach offers a promising premise for future remixers-- why not dress DM's synth-pop in the costumes of other genres until you find the right fit? Then there's the car crash at the end of the tunnel, Underworld's misguided ""Barrel of a Gun"" remix. I forget all my mid-90s micro-genre names, but there must be one for nine brain-dead minutes of window-rattling 180bpm drum loops. A limited-edition third disc boasts the set's only new material. As with everything else here, it's a mixed bag: Rex the Dog provides a solid electro-house update of early single ""Photographic"", Dave Gahan's lovely performance on ""Halo"" is gussied up by Allison Goldfrapp's accompanying vocals, and Ulrich Schnauss's ""Little 15"" is eerily sparse. The massive record concludes with ""Enjoy the Silence"" as ""reinterpreted"" by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda. Appearing on the band's 1990 masterwork Violator, the original single was an elegant, expressive take on an old theme, one familiar even to Gloria Estefan: ""Words Get in the Way"". But I'd take Miami Sound Machine over Shinoda's thuggish faux-rebellious thrash and his penchant for using Pro Tools-perfect guitar distortion that's as frigid as your ex-girlfriend. ""Words are meaningless and regrettable,"" Gahan sings, and so is this remix-- in all of its antiseptic glory.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2284-remixes-81-04/,Mute,2004.0
421,Neko Case,The Tigers Have Spoken,Folk/Country,7.6,November 4 2004,Stephen Deusner,,"At the end of ""Train From Kansas City""-- a track on Neko Case's new live album, The Tigers Have Spoken-- a lone voice, low and slightly garbled, yells ""We still love you!"" It's unclear what Case had done to warrant the ""still""-- perhaps a gaffe earlier in the show-- but amid the between-song chaos this declaration goes unanswered if not completely unnoticed. It's difficult to believe that Case isn't used to such public pronouncements of affection and devotion by now; you could tape any of her live shows and probably hear someone scream something similar. Case is beloved-- and for good reason. Her voice is a forceful instrument that sounds modeled on an array of songstresses from Patsy Cline to Aretha Franklin to Linda Lyndell to Kate Pierson. It seems to convey a distinct personality-- lonely and pained yet strong-willed and defiant. And despite the purposefully rough sound of The Tigers Have Spoken-- only one acoustic guitar line was overdubbed-- her voice sounds clear and confident, as sturdily engaged with the music as she seems to be with individual members of the audience. The Virginia native has also garnered an affectionate fan base through her easy mastery and lax definitions of many styles. As a result, Case's songs sound steeped in history but never beholden to it. A former drummer in various Vancouver punk bands, she caught the tail end of the alt-country movement with her solo debut, The Virginian, and snagged more listeners with her follow-up, Furnace Room Lullaby. But it was Case's third album, Blacklisted, that revealed the scope of her talents: On that LP she moved from vintage torch-and-twang and otherworldly blues to sweet soul music and plain old rock'n'roll. Not only did she manage to tie everything together into a cohesive whole without sounding distracted or hesitant, she ultimately turned that collection of admittedly lackluster songs into a calling card by making these genre jumps seem natural and largely invisible. The Tigers Have Spoken crams all those sounds and more into a mere 35 minutes. Instead of regurgitating a set list of already available tracks, the album-- which was recorded at shows in Toronto and Chicago-- includes new originals, covers, live staples, and rarities. Case's frequent backing band, members of The Sadies, nimbly follow her from song to song and style to style. They cover Loretta Lynn's ""Rated X"" with almost note-for-note faithfulness, yet manage to generate a go-go groove that is equally indebted to Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood. Similarly, on ""Train From Kansas City"", Case and The Sadies speed up the tempo of The Shangri-La's original, retaining the skipping snare drum but playing up the bittersweet inevitability of the train that carries the boy whose heart she must break. Case's own songs shine as brightly as the covers. ""If You Knew"", which opens the set, is a desperate plea for a lover to abandon his vapid other woman, and it could be directed at a certain popular hotel heiress: ""She spends her daddy's money/ And she drives her daddy's car/ But what's crazy is the way you think that's style."" The short title track constructs a devastating metaphor about the end of relationships around the inability to reintroduce zoo-kept tigers into their natural habitat, but Case feels no need to overexplain: She lets the tigers speak for themselves. Even better is ""Favorite""-- its low, lost, lonesome sound recalls the title track from Furnace Room Lullaby. Originally on a 2000 Bloodshot Records sampler, ""Favorite"" sounds fuller and more desperate in this live setting as the beautifully grim imagery of the final verse (""Last night I dreamt that I hit a dear with my car/ Blood from its heart spilled out onto my dress and was warm"") gives way to the spiraling banjo coda. Case is a singer first and a songwriter second, and The Tigers Have Spoken is afflicted with the same malady as Blacklisted: Many of its songs are too short, clocking in under two minutes. ""Blacklisted"", for example, cuts off before the two-minute mark-- shorter than the studio version-- without fully exploring the implications of its title, and her cover of the Nervous Eaters' ""Loretta"" cuts off just as soon as it gets going. It's no surprise that the best songs here-- ""Hex"", ""Train from Kansas City"", and ""Favorite""-- all exceed three minutes: They sound roomier and more lived-in. The Tigers Have Spoken ends with two public-domain songs. The show-closing chorale ""This Little Light of Mine"" barrels along like a freight train, and ""Wayfaring Stranger""-- the only track here not recorded during a club performance-- makes a dynamic encore. This version comes from Case's appearance at the ideaCity Conference in Toronto; accompanied only by banjo and acoustic guitar, she leads the conference attendees in a sing-a-long on the chorus. The sheer crowd of voices subtly undercuts the song's lonely rootlessness as Case invites everyone at the Isabel Bader Theatre home with her. Maybe that generosity is the reason so many people seem to love Neko Case: She loves them right back.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1324-the-tigers-have-spoken/,Anti-,2004.0
422,Devendra Banhart,Niño Rojo,Folk/Country,8.0,September 21 2004,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"It's funny that Young God founder Michael Gira should make a point in the press release for Niño Rojo that his role in Devendra Banhart's career was merely to release his music, that everything else took care of itself. I imagine Gira felt strongly about Banhart from the get-go, and his pleasant surprise that the rest of the world (inasmuch as Banhart's newfound popularity translates to the ""rest"" of anything) has since come to agree is equally understandable. Yet, I wonder if, like me, Gira gets the feeling that Banhart has arrived at a place where he's independent of Young God, himself, or his press. Journalists are often accused of hubris, wherein they're supposed to believe the things they write about are necessarily benefited due to increased publicity. In fact, musicians can benefit from this, but if I'm to believe Gira (and I do), Banhart's success is due more to people responding ""honestly to his music."" The last time I wrote about Banhart, regarding his Rejoicing in the Hands album from earlier this year, I emphasized how removed from contemporary context his songs felt. His music seemed to me neither superficially ""odd"" nor caught up in what my fellow music writers call ""freak-folk"" (despite the fact that Banhart's compilation Golden Apples of the Sun assisted greatly in defining the term). His music felt like the impressions of one person, stopped along the way to record things he saw or thought, and that even when I had no idea what he was talking about, the conviction at the heart of the songs would resound a long, deep chord. Almost two seasons later, things feel different: Like it or not, Banhart no longer sings for just one person (either himself, or whomever is hearing him) and, more than with any other artist, I'll identify him with 2004. How's that for context? Okay, so for the first fallacy in my revelation: None of the songs on Niño Rojo are any more or less intrinsically bound to 2004 than those on Rejoicing in the Hands. They were recorded at the same Lynn Bridges-coordinated sessions that produced the prior album, and in fact will be released as a single double-vinyl set with Rejoicing soon. I could take a very easy way out and assume that over time, these records will blend into one experience, in all likelihood becoming the definitive collection of Banhart's songs. However, where I formerly praised the singer/songwriter for taking me back to a time before MP3s and compulsive music consumption, I now believe that his preferences for surreal list-songs and lazy sing-alongs are simply an excellent counterpoint to these modern extravagances. And counterpoints are reactionary; they never exist alone. The second fallacy is that by admitting that Banhart's music seems to have a different audience or status within whatever group he's supposed to speak for, despite not actually ""changing,"" is that I assume he was ever speaking for anyone-- even scarier, that his music should necessarily be judged by whichever way the wind is blowing. Personally speaking, that's a sickening thought, but one that I take for granted in most mainstream music analysis. Gira talks about honest responses to music, and mine is that Banhart's songs are now as typically, idiosyncratically ""him"" as ever. I have the faint impression of a returning traveler, despite knowing these pieces aren't actually ""new."" However, it's not spring anymore, and few who hear this record are going to be in the same frame of mind they were last April. Perhaps that's a good argument for originally releasing Niño Rojo with Rejoicing as a double-CD set. It's no judgment against Banhart, but my gut says this music will be received slightly less enthusiastically than his prior work. That said, the music, fittingly, inevitably speaks for itself. The most interesting to me are the songs that suggest Banhart could become some kind of mythical roots-rocker, as on ""We All Know"" and ""Be Kind"". There, I imagine a very informal meeting of the minds in Memphis, where the ghosts of Richard Manuel, Gram Parsons and a drunk Joe Strummer bark out the choruses in Banhart's half-euphoric, half-tossed off songs. But he's preoccupied with other things: ""The light of this whole world and mind aligns your legs to time."" I think that means he has a crush on CocoRosie's Bianca Casady, to whom ""Be Kind"" is dedicated. He gets even more to the point on ""A Ribbon"", with his most straightforward request, ""I'd like to sleep with you if you'd like me to."" However, Banhart's disinterest in obvious narratives is, for now, his greatest strength. Even when, as on ""Ay Mama"", his statements would be clear, he obscures them. ""Ay Mama, no hay que llorar,"" repeated over delicate, finger-picked acoustic guitar figures, serves as mantra-- all the better not knowing he's trying to persuade his mother that it's not necessary to cry. Would the song have more emotional weight if I didn't have to google the translation? Banhart, throughout Niño Rojo, demonstrates that it wouldn't; the whimsical non-sequiturs of ""We All Know"" (""Like the type of tongue that roots from your breast/ And it shakes your pretty little clavicle""), the zoological parade of ""Little Yellow Spider"" (where Banhart pays tribute to pigs mating with men, crabs turning to crab-cakes, and white monkeys who figured out something he couldn't understand) and the poetic depictions of ""Owl Eyes"" (""Semilla/ Owl Eyes unwinding/ Asia/ All your little diamonds, all your little diamonds"") reveal little beyond the impressions of dusty, old calm and the American surreal. Banhart covers Ella Jenkins' ""Wake Up, Little Sparrow"" as the opener to this album. The 80-year-old Jenkins has a made a career of creating children's folk music with an educational and inclusively moral bent, and perhaps lends Niño Rojo its best context: Over time, beyond cultural movement and sociological or musicological phenomenon, Banhart's record makes the most sense at the mercy of simple pleasures and the young at heart. You want truth? Beauty? They're here, in basic forms. Progress and relevance are very different concerns, and ones I'm willing to leave to historians with a better advantage. And as all Gira had to do was release the stuff, at the moment, I'm content to listen in turn.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/550-nino-rojo/,Young God,2004.0
423,The Clash,London Calling: 25th Anniversary Legacy Edition,Rock,10.0,September 21 2004,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"The 25th anniversary reissue of The Clash's London Calling is satisfyingly thick and protected by a thin plastic sleeve. The package sits fat at three stories high; the spine is broad, smooth and silver. Pennie Smith's unfocused, emblematic cover shot remains intact, with Paul Simonon's bass hovering, vertical and doomed, between Elvis-baiting pink and green text. Stacked inside are three separate discs: the original 19-song album, a 21-track disc containing rehearsal sessions for the record (""the long lost Vanilla Tapes""), and a DVD of The Last Testament, Don Letts' 30-minute, after-the-fact documentary about the making of London Calling. Here, neatly lined up: preparation, realization, hindsight. Finally. This is how they did it. For those who came of age in the late 80s and early 90s, calling The Clash a punk band was (and remains) more a matter of affect than honesty-- in 2004, wholly and completely divorced from a context that never fully resonated with a global audience, The Clash are a rock band, and 1979's London Calling is their creative apex, a booming, infallible tribute to throbbing guitars and spacious ideology. By the late 70s, ""punk"" was more specifically linked with rusted safety pins, shit-covered Doc Martens, and tight pink sneers than any steadfast, organized philosophy; The Clash insisted on forefronting their politics. This album tackles topical issues with impressive gusto-- the band cocks their cowboy hats, assumes full outlaw position, and pillages the world market for sonic fodder and lyric-ready injustice. A quarter-century after its first release, London Calling is still the concentrate essence of The Clash's unparalleled fervor. As always, London Calling's title track holds steady as the record's cosmic lynchpin: Horrifyingly apocalyptic, ""London Calling"" is riddled with weird werewolf howls and big, prophetic hollers, Mick Jones' punchy guitar bursts tapping little nails into our skulls, pushing hard for total lunacy. Empowered and unafraid, Strummer reveals self-skewering prophecies, panting hard about nuclear errors and impending ice ages. He also spitefully lodges some of the most unpleasantly convincing calls to arms ever committed to tape, commanding his followers-- now, then, future-- to storm the streets at full, leg-flailing sprints. Even if The Clash were more blatantly inspired by the musical tenets of dub and reggae, ""London Calling"" unapologetically cops the fury of punk's blind-and-obliterate full-body windmilling, bypassing the cerebral cortex to sink deep into our muscles. From ""London Calling"" on, The Clash do not let go; each track builds on the last, pummeling and laughing and slapping us into dumb submission. And now, we get to watch how it fell together: Using only a Teac four-track tape recorder linked up to a portastudio, The Clash inadvertently immortalized their London Calling rehearsal sessions at Vanilla Studios (a former rubber factory-gone-rehearsal-space in Pimlico, London) in the summer of 1979, several weeks before the album sessions officially opened at Wessex Studios. One set of tapes got left on the Tube. Another got crammed into a box. The intricate (and generally convoluted) mythology of the ""long lost recording"" is embarrassingly familiar to rock fans-- even non-completists are awkwardly prone to chasing down bits of buried tape with insane, eye-bulging intensity. With precious few exceptions, the anticipation of a hidden, indefinitely concealed secret generally supercedes the impact of the actual artifact. Still, the possibility of stumbling into transcendence keeps the search heated, and sometimes stupidly dramatic. Earlier this month, Mick Jones bravely explained to Mojo's Pat Gilbert exactly how he uncovered the tapes: ""I sensed where they were and that took me to the right box. I opened it up and found them... It was pretty amazing."" Snicker all you want at the supernatural, sixth-sense implications, or at the idea of Jones' third eye blazing hot for misplaced Clash recordings-- the 21 tracks that the constitute The Vanilla Tapes are just revealing enough to justify all the smoky mysticism. The tapes feature five previously unheard cuts-- ""Heart and Mind"", ""Where You Gonna Go (Soweto)"", ""Lonesome Me"", the instrumental ""Walking the Slidewalk"", and a cover of Matumbi's version of Bob Dylan's ""The Man in Me"", plucked from Dylan's 1970 album New Morning and reproduced in full reggae glory-- and together they reveal producer Guy Stevens' influence on the final sound of London Calling: muddy, raw, and insistently vague, The Vanilla Tapes see The Clash working hard, but also grasping for a muse. Professionally, Guy Stevens was best known for ""discovering"" The Who and producing a handful of Mott the Hoople records, but it was his recreational exploits that carved the deepest cut into Britain's collective pop memory. With a frenzied halo of tightly curled brown hair and a penchant for destroying property, Stevens came to rule Wessex Studios, hurling chairs and ladders, wrestling with engineers, and famously dumping a bottle of red wine into Strummer's Steinway piano. Fortunately, Guy was far more concerned with encouraging ""real, honest emotion"" than with achieving technical perfection (true to form, London Calling has its fair share of slipped fingers), and consequently, the band's determination at Vanilla, coupled with Stevens' shitstorming, led to London Calling's odd and glorious balance of studied dedication and absurd inspiration. And if The Vanilla Tapes aren't enough to satisfy your voyeuristic tendencies, there's more. For The Last Testament, documentarian/DJ Don Letts (also responsible for Clash on Broadway and Westway to the World) weaves together bits of live footage, interviews with punk pundits and band members (they spout tiny clarifications between snickers and cigarette huffs), promotional videos, and a few small, grainy glimpses of the band recording at Wessex. The studio shots were culled from footage that, like The Vanilla Tapes, had been unknowingly cardboard boxed for years-- in early 2004, former manager Kosmo Vinyl up a crate containing 84 minutes of hand-held footage of the London Calling sessions. Most of the film turned out to be unusable, but Letts salvaged some revealing shots of Stevens in fine form, wrestling with ladders and banging around chairs, in a curious reversal of classic producer/band hijinx. As an instruction manual, the 25th anniversary edition of London Calling offers up bits of helpful, ordinary wisdom (he who fucks nuns will later join the church, no one gets their shit for free-- and ""Balls to you, big daddy!"" is an infallible exit line), but the album's biggest lesson is still spiritual. Like a bit of good gossip or a dog-eared copy of On the Road, Clash tapes tend to get passed around, and wind up forming countless intimate, enduring, and cathartic bonds. That Joe Strummer's handwritten lyrics and modest scribblings have finally been tucked into the liner notes is only appropriate: London Calling is just as precious.

424,The Black Keys,Rubber Factory,Rock,8.3,September 9 2004,Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,"Now that The Black Keys have solidified themselves as ranking contenders in the garage-blues tag-team division (a recognized and surprisingly competitive weight class), they've got a whole field of challengers to fend off. I'm thinking primarily of me, the critic, looking to measure their latest effort against its vaunted predecessors, counting the faults, tallying the improvements, making a decision. But the band has garnered a sizable fanbase indifferent to prior allegiances-- mud-caked Bonnaroo jam fans, NPR-driven blues boosters, and fist-pumping hard rock loyalists have all been trampled under The Black Keys' roots-chewing corduroy stomp. So really, it makes little difference what I have to say; most of you have already decided these guys are the real deal. Those who haven't, however, can rest assured that, in judging The Black Keys' budding discography, Rubber Factory beats their previous two by TKO. That's because it picks up right where Thickfreakness left off-- outside the bar in the gravel parking lot, swinging aggressively with Dan Auerbach's ferocious six-string and Patrick Carney's cymbal-and-snare seizures-- and brings the noise one step further. There's more of an album feel to Rubber Factory, a conscious song-by-song progression rather than the visceral, overwhelming vibe that forged their debut, The Big Come Up, into a seething wrecking ball. When Auerbach settles down with a lap steel on ""The Lengths"", it's no mere diversion-- there's true conviction behind his country blues balladry. In its rosy tenderness, ""The Lengths"" is the biggest departure from the band's studied template. Auerbach sings, ""Please yourself/ You don't have to be afraid,"" and it seems obvious he's convincing himself that he and Carney have carved out a niche deep enough they can break out of it with confidence to deliver something totally unexpected and achingly sweet. ""The Lengths"" isn't the album's only curveball-- The Kinks cover ""Act Nice and Gentle"" finds The Black Keys tuning into the FM side of the dial. Where Ray Davies' original is twangy, sugary pop, The Black Keys give it a honky-tonk swing, as Auerback plies the slide and Carney's fireworks fade to a gentle sizzle. ""Grown So Ugly"" is a tragic prison blues penned by Robert Pete Williams and covered in the 1970s by Captain Beefheart. Auerbach tears into the standard with typical grit, but halfway through, pulls back into a short-lived vocal break that merits his position in the Fat Possum pantheon. Those three tunes stand out as impressive tangents that skillfully mediate the rest of the album's oldtime Black Keys thunder. Songs like ""Stack Shot Billy"" and ""Girl Is on My Mind"" show the memorable songwriting that made Thickfreakness a standout. ""When the Lights Go Out"" opens Rubber Factory with a Bonham-esque bass pulse and an ominously pealing guitar, while closer ""Till I Get My Way"" lays one line of primitive Auerbach distortion over another more genteel melody until the two eventually swim together beneath Carney's splashy cymbal work. And then there's ""10 A.M. Automatic"", Rubber Factory's first single and easily one of the most radio-ready indie anthems of the year, next to Modest Mouse's ""Float On"". It's the song most likely to show up in a Guy Ritchie flick next summer, a cool-as-fuck, hormone-laced dose of rock 'n' roll ecstasy. Here, Auerbach's voice attains that archetypal blues fever that induced the birth of rock 50 years ago; melody and rhythm mesh into a primal force that's raw and pure. The Black Keys have consistently sought to keep their distance from modern blues, calling themselves a rock band above anything else. But we all know the blues resides at the core of rock 'n' roll. Rubber Factory sways back and forth almost imperceptibly between the two idioms, revitalizing the essence of both.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/767-rubber-factory/,Fat Possum,2004.0
425,My Morning Jacket,Acoustic Citsuoca EP,Rock,7.5,July 22 2004,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"""Watchin' a crowd roll in
Out go the lights it begins
A feelin' in my bones I never felt before
People always told me
that bars are dark and lonely
And talk is often cheap and filled with air."" My Morning Jacket's Jim James sings those words on ""Golden"", the effervescent centerpiece of last year's excellent It Still Moves. It's hard to think of a more poignant evocation of the mix of nerves and adrenaline that precede a live performance. But when he sings it over a spare arrangement of two acoustic guitars on the new live EP Acoustic Citsuoca, there's no hint of nervousness or hesitation-- he just goes for it. James is one of those people who's been blessed with a voice that you could never mistake for another-- it's a clean, piercing tenor that reveals vulnerability when needed, but mostly just soars. James doesn't even need to be saying anything to shiver spines, and when he lets his falsetto rip on a wordless passage of ""mmm's"" and ""aaah's"" at the end of this version of ""Golden"", it's one of the absolute highlights of a pretty strong set. Perhaps what makes the passion behind the playing and singing on this EP most remarkable, though, is the fact that it was recorded at a very casual Halloween gathering in the most excellently named town in Massachusetts, Braintree. There's a laidback, unrehearsed feel to most of it, particularly the three stripped-down solo tracks. Around the two-minute mark in a run through At Dawn's unrelentingly gorgeous ""Bermuda Highway"", James slips for a second on his acoustic and utters a barely audible little ""oop!"", and soon after that, almost bursts out laughing as he sings the verse twice by mistake. Yet, these mistakes lend the music a sense of jovial intimacy, especially when set against the powerful directness of their content. To hear these songs presented on record without the pools of reverb that My Morning Jacket's albums tend to float in is intriguing; they hold up very nicely. The two fully arranged tracks that open the set are especially revealing. ""The Bear"", from the band's debut, kicks off with the classic ""Be My Baby"" drumbeat, but with just the natural reverb of the Startime Pavilion, it sounds very different. The effect is interesting, the band shuffling along with an easy groove while James climbs up into the ionosphere with his vocal booster rockets. The version of ""Sooner"", originally from the Chocolate & Ice EP, actually bests the original in some respects, particularly in the late verses when the guitars are replaced with an ominously beeping keyboard (featured in the original, but buried under a lot of other stuff) nicely befitting the Halloween milieu in which the song was performed. It's not really going out on a limb to say that this is required listening for any established My Morning Jacket fan, even if newcomers would do better to start with one of their three full-lengths (take your pick; they're all fantastic). It's a well-captured and spirited performance-- ""a most enchanting night,"" as Berman puts it-- and a fine between-albums teaser for fans can't get quite enough of My Morning Jacket's unique brand of sonic seduction.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5534-acoustic-citsuoca-ep/,ATO,2004.0
426,The Roots,The Tipping Point,Rap,5.4,July 14 2004,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"In seventh grade, I caught the bug and paid a really pretty girl $15 for a Roots cassette bootleg she'd made. The group at this point had become a minor street phenomenon in the local alt-weeklies, but Black Thought's city-specific freestyles over ?uestlove's soul-powered grooves still remained a guarded Philadelphia secret. The Roots had also garnered attention then for having attending the prestigious Creative and Performing Arts high school (CAPA), as the school's artistic mission was so rigidly anti-popular and l'art pour l'art. It was win/win: The CAPA tag offered The Roots instant artistic legitimacy, and The Roots made CAPA the coolest place in the world. Six records in, several Roots members are no longer even Philadelphians, let alone CAPA alums. Still, I've always tried to understand each Roots album as capturing the band's original CAPA vs. Pop paradox: smart lyrics and jazz backbeats whose abstract tendencies never came at the expense of accessibility. By 1999's Things Fall Apart, however, The Roots had discovered a balance within that paradox and fulfilled their initial promise, and 2002's experimental Phrenology documented the band at a critical point of self-revision: Beyond the intense creative pressure The Roots put on themselves and their genre, they also added a guitarist, said farewell to Malik B., and welcomed more guest spots than ever before. There's something to be said for the fact that Phrenology housed both The Roots' most difficult songs and two extremely successful radio singles, ""The Seed (2.0)"" and ""Break You Off"". On The Tipping Point, though, The Roots forgo experimentation altogether, focusing their energy on a new direction: adult-oriented rap. For an album borne from jam sessions-- a technique the band employed to guide them toward a looser feel-- this is easily the flattest and most Grammy-conscious album The Roots have made. Its majority carelessly regurgitates the painful cliches of ""enlightened"" hip-hop's critical and commercial darlings, while the band falls back on their organic hip-hop sound as a gimmick and piles on guest appearances to disguise their lack of creativity. In other words, if you thought ?uestlove's cameo on Joss Stone's putrid ""Fell in Love with a Boy"" was a regrettable misstep, pull up a trashcan and get ready to wretch. Opening track ""Star"" reveals that The Roots have become more chimerical than ever: Here, the band drums up a faux-Timbaland beat that fights with a sample of Sly & The Family Stone's ""Everyone Is a Star"", while Black Thought assures us, ""This ain't pop like Kylie Minogue."" Unfortunately, that may be the track's lyrical peak. By the outro, The Roots have slumped into a neo-soul take on The Spinners' ""It's a Shame""-- just the first of many in The Tipping Point's soulless neo-soul fluff-track cadre. Sadly, The Roots seem to be following the Black Eyed Peas' lead on The Tipping Point-- and not just musically. Among the album's giant lyrical flops are: ""Yeah, it ain't nothin' like the rush I get in front of the band/ On stage with the planet in the palm of my hand"" (from the album's atrocious first single ""Don't Say Nothin'""), ""This rap game is like selling coke legally"" (off ""Somebody's Gotta Do It""), and finally, ""Why""'s caricatured insight, ""Some people's chasing their dream/ Some people's chasing their high."" The record doesn't fare much better elsewhere: ""Guns Are Drawn"" is a Reflection Eternal C-side; ""Boom!"", on which Thought impersonates Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap, wants to be Beastie but barely puts up a fight to party; and ""Duck Down"" brings us back to Timbo-esque beats, this time with a kickdrum sound that drowns out the hornlines that may otherwise have served as the track's only saving grace. The Tipping Point does have two bright spots: ?uestlove beats the hell out of his cymbal while managing a slew of stop/starts and a sick minimal stomp on ""The Web"", and the Kranz beat and river of great guest rhymes on hidden track ""The Mic"" is ironically the album's most fun cut. Both songs are straightforward raps, and stick out on The Tipping Point precisely for this unadorned simplicity; by and large, the album is much too concerned with playing it safe, and generally fails for its lack of casual insouciance. Illadelph Halflife and Things Fall Apart opened with the following warning: ""Inevitably, hip-hop albums are treated as though they are disposable. They're not maximized as product even, you know, not to mention as art."" The sample is appropriately absent from The Tipping Point. There's no doubt that The Roots have maximized their product with this record; unfortunately, it's resulted in their first disposable release.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6834-the-tipping-point/,Geffen,2004.0
427,The Killers,Hot Fuss,Rock,5.2,July 5 2004,Johnny Loftus,,"The Killers' press release is surprisingly straightforward, explicitly detailing the punchcard proving ground that this Las Vegas quartet sprang from before phrases like ""bidding war"" and ""headlining tour"" entered their daily vocabulary. But it can afford this bit of honesty, since the British music press has shouldered the load of attendant Killers hyperbole, and because the band's Hot Fuss checks most of its truths at the door to their 800-foot limo. By autumn 2003, their single ""Mr. Brightside"" had secured the usual Best! Band! Ever! overstatements from UK scribes, and the song's happily vacant grafting of New Order decadence to Housemartins bop bounced it hard into CMJ and SXSW. Subsequently, the band's dance card attracted Warbucksian suitors of the largest variety. And now, the resulting Hot Fuss drops on both sides of the Atlantic wrapped in this tabloid backstory, unable to separate its hype from its unabashedly referential sound. Hot Fuss floats boatloads of blasÃ© lyrics about the pressures of being fabulous and the politics of fucking over an easily sippable blend of 80s and 90s British pop influences, rarely pausing to test the end product. Top-shelf mixing and attention to melody helps out the record's appeal as lifestyle music for sheltered bloggers and female professionals who still wear cool hairstyles. But damnit if that demographic leaves little room for a life of The Killers' own. Where are they, besides their wily references to past pop pros and a vague sense of Sin City cynicism? Not anywhere, really: The Killers are just the latest band to be born too quick inside the popular music vacuum, where expectations for broad accessibility kill dudes' potential for deeper creativity quite fabulously dead. This is disappointing, since Fuss' better moments make The Killers' knack for hooks and cool poses clear. Vocalist/keyboardist Brandon Flowers has replaced his tonsils with melodrama; he's hijacked Jarvis Cocker's accent to make his Vegas-boy rep sound that much tighter. ""Brightside"" isn't getting near the dejection of The Stills; it has no illusions about being anything other than a provocative single. Its relentless keyboard 'n' guitar racket shuns dourness altogether, as Flowers remarkably makes lines about a girlfriend getting off with some other guy resonate as some kind of weird triumph. ""Somebody Told Me""'s deadpan couplets about having a ""boyfriend who looks like a girlfriend"" are similarly clever, but the cut's a brazen rewrite of The Strokes' treble-kick heroics. Yes, Casablancas, et al ripped off pieces of their sound, too, but that's the difference-- they already did the ripping. The Killers' recombination arrives too late to be recognized as first-tier thievery. At this point, Hot Fuss is just bringing it from what's already been brought. Hot Fuss opener ""Jenny Was a Friend of Mine"" establishes Flowers' admirable love for tones lost to rockers' rising fears of sounding too fruity. But as the album's singles follow in quick succession, rocking a sound softer than post-punk but full of the stuff that came right after it, The Killers can't figure a way to add resonance beyond adding more keyboards, more layered guitars, more cribbing of established tastemaking currency (check the intellectual-property-case-waiting-to-happen that is ""Change Your Mind""). In other words, Hot Fuss has no use for subtlety. It revels in its appearance as The Shit from day one, allowing for filler-type indulgences like the impossibly aimless-- and quite possibly shitty-- ""Everything Will Be Alright"". Meanwhile, Fuss' UK version excises the brazenly contemporary raggedness of ""Change Your Mind"" for the astoundingly inane ""Indie Rock 'n' Roll"", a blaring joke of thick-chorded guitar and arrogant, pitch-corrected yowling that gives out cornholes to every unknown American group valiantly trying to find the cracks of creativity in its titular sound. So, it's plain that The Killers have made a record more concerned with artifice than artistry. If the intent is to place their album's principal teases on the next Now That's What I Call Music compilation, then bravo. But why does it try to squeak by as another deft pop reversion when it actually seems to be a revisionist cash dance? For the kids, I presume. But Hot Fuss is not hardcore; it's hard evidence that it's tough to focus on making great rock when you're preoccupied with cultivating an image.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4579-hot-fuss/,Island,2004.0
428,Prince,Musicology,"Pop/R&B,Rock",5.8,April 28 2004,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"One of the first things a rock critic learns is not to emphasize the character on the other end of the speakers when reviewing records. This person, who is playing the tunes and singing the songs, isn't to be treated as a performer so much as the instigator of all the terrible/wonderful noise infesting the writer's world, and should be judged accordingly. That is, by the social rules of rock criticism, one shouldn't judge the musicians at all, merely their music-- and even then, only in terms of how it affects the writer, and in turn, how it might do the same for other listeners. The ""argument"" comes during the moments when you either agree or disagree with the writer's experience. The next thing writers learn is that just thinking of one's own experience isn't enough, because there's a whole world out there giving clues to the real value of the music. If music ""matters,"" it follows that its impact should be obvious outside the window; ""relevance"" is paramount at this stage of criticism, though since bitter humility is a daily part of any rock writer's life, it pays to phrase arguments stressing relevance in ways that don't obviously indicate its bias. This kind of criticism may seem harsh (and pretty unrelated to the actual musical experience), but it also shares much with traditional journalistic aims of reporting and immediate interpretation, and as such, is a method emphasized at most mainstream music pubs. All of this brings me to Prince and his latest album, Musicology. What happens when, by the two most common forms of writing about music, a legend comes out looking like a drastic underachiever? Do I dare call him out on this, especially after seeing many educated people pledge their written testimonies to this stuff? I've lived with this record for a few weeks now, and by any normal measure, I fail to see how anyone could seriously call it a comeback, or a return to his intimidating good form. But that's presumptuous: Despite the tried-and-true edicts of rock crit, there really is no accounting for taste, nor is Prince's extended absence from the top of the pops a concrete sign that he no longer matters. Yet, I know what I hear: an artist who is beyond condescending his interests to generate relevance. I hear someone who's honestly more concerned with the pristine state of his record collection than he is in buying all the latest hits. I hear someone who's probably worked out most of the bigger issues in life, and is satisfied to stay with a groove for its own sake, offering his take on things rather than arresting you with it. Prince has never been embarrassed of himself on record, but on Musicology, his direction only makes sense to me in the broadest sense of appreciating life and love. The revolution is over in this corner, and I'd bet it all he could care less what anyone thinks about it. Unfortunately, in this case, it translates to music that, while often pleasant, lacks the power of not only his best work, but also most of his successors' stuff. And since Prince's ""successors"" could be considered half of everything on the radio, it's tough for me to give him the benefit of the doubt. The most interesting moments on Musicology come when Prince either hits on a good concept (like the rich white girl who can't dance paying out for the ""funk"" in ""Illusion, Coma, Pimp and Circumstance"") or drops the pretense of keeping the party going altogether. Today, slow jams are his forte: the infidelity warning ""What Do U Want Me 2 Do?"" beats Phoenix at their own game with smoother-than-smooth vocals and a breezy chorus that would seem to close the book on anyone else attempting lite-jazz pop in the future. ""Call My Name"" is hardly as distinct, but is a perfectly functional slab of loverman soul along the lines of Marvin Gaye. Typically, Prince saves his best moves for the chorus (he's still pop, through and through), as his layered harmonies impart the rather straightforward admission, ""I know it's only been three hours, but I love it when you call my name."" Those songs seem a tier above others on Musicology partially because Prince isn't doing his one-man band thing. Despite that I've always thought it was cool to hear him make records mostly by himself, some of the songs here betray either a disinterest in fleshing out arrangements or an inability to pull them off. ""A Million Days"" has the structure of good Prince rock ballad, but the sound of half-finished demo. The synth that powers the opening sounds piped in from a home studio built about 20 years ago, and even then it's not loud enough. His guitar and vocals are lavishly spread all over the mix, but the drums are too soft and muddy, so ultimately his track comes out like a bad Lenny Kravitz throwaway. Elsewhere, ""Life O' the Party"" and the title track suggest nothing in Prince's life these days was born this century. Not only does he waste valuable time on the former making fun of Michael Jackson, but the track is mired in stale funk a notch below the Martin theme. ""Cinnamon Girl"" is the best straight rock track on Musicology, not only because its production is on par with Prince's typically well-crafted hooks, but also because it manages to keep all the details in check via relatively simple performance. Prince's grasp is hardly lacking throughout, but for various reasons, his reach comes up short many times. ""If Eye Was the Man in Ur Life"" starts out as an incredible jam with metal guitar, a tight, slow beat (not played by Prince) and a glorious harmonized verse melody, before bogging down at the end with some kind of be-bop thing right out of a Blood, Sweat & Tears song. I'm all for experimentation, but this seems more like a bad case of mid-song boredom and a lack of anything better to do. The worst part is that Musicology is probably the best Prince album since at least the ""symbol"" album from 1992, and possibly since Sign O' the Times. But that's misleading, since this album isn't close to Sign's league-- it's also depressing to think he hasn't made a great record in over 15 years. But don't take my word for it; look out the window, see if any of your friends are jamming to this. Failing that, chart your own experience in your own headphones. By either measure, despite a few good moments, I'm missing Prince now more than ever.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6479-musicology/,"Columbia,NPG",2004.0
429,James Brown,Live at the Apollo [Expanded Edition],Rock,10.0,March 30 2004,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Syd Nathan never wanted this record made. The King Records founder had a long history of working with black performers, ever since the late 40s when he decided to get into ""the race business"" after initially only concentrating on ""hillbilly accounts."" This is a man who had not only started his own independent label, but also bankrolled his own recording studios, pressing plant and distribution network. He was keenly aware of talent, using A&R; reps (who would later be his scapegoats when pressed by the FCC during the payola hearings of the 50s) to snatch up big band singers and bandleaders, in the hopes of transforming them into viable sensations for what would one day be called ""crossover"" appeal. He tried country, blues, doo-wop and R&B--; he might not have capitalized on every opportunity (most notably letting The Platters go to Mercury in 1953, only to witness them become the most successful vocal group of the decade), but he was certainly willing to try. Nathan signed Macon, Georgia performer James Brown in 1956 to his King subsidiary, Federal, despite a less than favorable view of the ""Please, Please, Please"" demo (in short, ""That's the worst piece of crap I've heard in my life""). Brown and his band, The Famous Flames, had already toured the South when he was signed for $200 to Federal, but he had yet to convince Nathan and Federal to allow him to record with the band. It wouldn't happen until Brown and the Flames scored a hit called ""Mashed Potatoes"" under the pseudonym Nat Kendrick & The Swans for another label. After Brown hit regionally with ""Please, Please, Please"" in 1956 for Federal, Nathan's original appraisal appeared to have been off the mark. That is, until Brown's next nine singles in a row flopped. Badly. Brown and the Flames finally scored a national hit with their eleventh single for Federal, ""Try Me"", which granted him further stay on the label. Nathan was rewarded, too, as over the next four years, the band earned its reputation as the best in the biz, performing as The James Brown Revue (""Star Time""), and saddling its frontman with several well-applied titles: ""The Hardest Working Man in Show Business,"" ""Mr. Dynamite"" and ultimately, ""The Godfather of Soul."" By 1962, Brown intended to showcase his act with a live album, especially after seeing Ray Charles hit with In Person in 1959. He'd played Harlem's Apollo Theater several times, but when Nathan refused to pay for a live recording on the basis that he wouldn't have a single to promote it, Mr. Dynamite had to take matters into his own hands. Brown personally funded the recording of his Wednesday night show at The Apollo on October 24th, 1962. He and the Flames had been there all week already, and Brown was counting on the raucous crowds who showed for amateur night to give him the kind of support he knew Nathan couldn't ignore. For his part, Nathan had reluctantly sent one of his people to supervise the recording, but could hardly have expected it to result in this album. It's more than a little strange to think King had originally issued Live at the Apollo with canned applause and screams because not only were the Apollo faithful in full ""support"" of Brown's revue, that night has gone down in rock and soul history as arguably the finest live performance ever captured on record. Not bad for a guy who'd been one flop away from failure only a few years earlier. Live at the Apollo was issued in 1963 and became an instant hit. Not only did it satisfy Brown's small legion of diehard fans-- to the tune of being played in its entirety during the evenings on some R&B; radio stations-- for the first time, it brought the undeniably intense celebration of his live show to young audiences throughout the country. This might not have been very important in another era, but just as Live at the Apollo can be seen as a symbolic transformation of R&B; into Soul, for a myriad of events, 1963 marked the dawn of a decade when sharing experiences and points of view across an entire culture meant more than just crossover success. It was the true beginning of the 60s, and Brown's half-hour Wednesday night set figures no less prominently than Dylan bringing protest music to the masses or The Beatles arriving in America the following year as musical signposts for A New Day. Emcee Fats Gonder's introduction to the show is as fine a setup as a performer could ask for: ""So now, ladies and gentlemen, it is Star Time. Are you ready for Star Time?!"" The Flames give hits upon each Brown hit that Gonder lists, and the eager crowd responds with due enthusiasm (i.e., screams, lots and lots of screams). The band then drops a cutting version of Brown's ""The Scratch"" to urge the Man onstage. And what do you think Brown should announce as soon as he arrives? Two years before ""I Got You"", and he lets us have it: ""You know, I feel alright!"" The band launches ""I'll Go Crazy"" with the slash of Les Buie's guitar and the sting of horns. ""If you leave me, I'll go crazy,"" sings the leader, and the audience can already barely stand themselves. Horn punches accentuate the message Brown has taken with him to this day: ""You gotta live for yourself, and nobody else."" Just as soon as he's delivered the advice, Brown pleas to ""Try Me! SCREAM! Try Me!"" His trio of background singers, Bobby Byrd, Bobby Bennett and ""Baby"" Lloyd Stallworth, echo the sentiments, while the band locks the bluesy shuffle in tighter than the tension on Clay Fillyau's snare head. And again, before you can catch your breath, the band is already into the post-jump intro to ""Think"". Star Time was a lesson in speed, endurance and shared inspiration: If you gave the band everything you had, they'd return the favor tenfold. Then, things get really good with a dit-dit-dit-DOOO and the ultra-cool, slow burning blues seduction of ""I Don't Mind"". With each beat, falling just behind where you expect it to land, Brown and his angelic backing choir deliver a fatal blow to any woman within earshot: ""I don't mind, and I know you're gonna miss me."" Jesus. Just in case you didn't think he was serious, good luck surviving ""Lost Someone"", ten minutes of gospel-tinged balladry somehow slower and lower than the preceding number. The Flames horns (led by trumpeter Lewis Hamlin) maintain a faint bond to Count Basie while at the same time handing Brown the razor-sharp precision he demanded. Between each declaration of passion, the horns serve an upturned figure, just enough to hold the audience in their place lest they faint from what must by then have been a steamy auditorium. And can I get a medic to those two girls JB was singing to at the end? The Flames were masters of pacing, and roll out a six-minute medley of their hits to keep the show rolling, including ""Please, Please, Please"" (twice!), ""You've Got the Power"" and ""Why Do You Do Me"". The audience doesn't miss a beat, of course, and the only thing more powerful than Fillyau's bass drum kicks are their shrieks. And then things get REALLY REALLY good: ""All aboard!"" ""Yeah!"" ""All aboard!"" ""Yeah!"" ""For NIGHT TRAIN!"" Brown ends the show with his then latest hit, running down a list of cities in which he was quickly becoming a household name. He even gets his band excited when name checking New York City. ""Night Train"" is full of complex polyrhythms and demands total precision from the musicians, but you can hardly blame them for getting swept up in this show. The original Live at the Apollo ended after ""Night Train"", but the newly expanded and remastered version contains four mono single-edits of songs from the show that Brown issued to tide over fans unable to catch one of his 300 yearly shows. 40 years later, the few remaining folks either unaware or somehow unconvinced of the power of the record have little excuse not to put down the bucks for this budget-priced edition. Beyond its significance in rock and soul history, and for Brown as an artist, this music translates so far beyond barriers of style or taste, it's one of the few albums that could accurately be described as essential. Fats Gonder said it best: ""It is indeed a great pleasure to present to you at this particular time... James Brown & The Famous Flames."" Amen.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/976-live-at-the-apollo-expanded-edition/,"King,King",1963.0
430,Devendra Banhart,Rejoicing in the Hands,Folk/Country,8.4,March 16 2004,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"You and I listen to more music than anyone in the history of civilization. I don't mean more than your friend or that guy on that message board who seems to know about every buzz-worthy leaked CD before anyone else, but rather, more than any previous generation of active music fans. Think about all our MP3s and CDRs, the stuff we actually buy, and then add in the music we hear once and immediately declare isn't worth the 45 seconds we spent with it. It almost seems ridiculous, because ultimately, few of us would be willing to recommend more than but a few songs (let alone albums) to anyone outside our close-knit music circles. Digital media was supposed to satisfy the audiophiles with better sound and the businessmen with yet another kind of product to convince us we weren't getting everything we could out of music/life. However, its primary effect has been to level music's impact to a similar scale as any other commodity-- outside those few songs we cling to like family, most of it ends up being used as trade-bait, rep maintenance, decoration and garbage. It's easy to blame this on the digital age, but then, it seems to have been going on longer than MP3s and file-sharing. Kids have been comparing and competing with record collections for as long as I can remember-- probably as long as my mom can remember, too-- but there must have been a time when our hallowed few songs were the only ones that mattered at all. Maybe during the days when people were more worried about war or disease or how they were going to eat in the winter; was it ""folk music"" they were hearing and singing? I imagine ""entertainment"" and ""self-expression"" weren't as valuable as functionality and therapeutic relevance in music. Devendra Banhart's second full-length (and first of two planned 2004 releases), Rejoicing in the Hands, harkens back to a time before music had so many cultural roles. It's not necessarily an ""old-fashioned"" record, insofar as his performances or songs are concerned. Banhart's lyrics are as often seemingly nonsensical as they are evocative or descriptive, and his songs defy almost any conventional form you care to introduce. There are references to traditional American folk and blues, as well as hints of British acoustic folk along the lines of Fairport Convention, Bert Jansch and Banhart favorite Vashti Bunyan (who sings on the title track). However, for the most part, Rejoicing in the Hands is a record concerned with the absolute smallest things in life-- which usually end up being the most important-- helping pass the time when time is the only thing going anywhere. It's unconcerned with the past or the future, and is only too ready to supply songs you could sing after dinner or first thing in the morning. It seems valuable to hear something like ""we have a choice, we chose rejoice"" coming from a new CD, as if that was the only kind of value music was ever supposed to have. Unlike Banhart's 2002 debut, Oh Me Oh My, Rejoicing in the Hands was professionally recorded, and a few tracks feature backing musicians (including Angels of Light alums Thor Harris, Joe McGinty and Siobahn Duffy). It's far from slick, though, reeking of rustic, homemade charm. Furthermore, it surpasses Oh Me Oh My in both songwriting and Banhart's singing. His songs no longer veer into bizarro cadences or witchy vocal overdubs; Young God's Michael Gira remarks that he didn't want to pigeonhole Banhart as a lo-fi eccentric, and consequently, the singer's range of expression (and surprising delicacy) is given full justice. Opener ""This Is the Way"" sets forth the unhurried charge, confident in its own idiosyncrasy. Banhart's wordless count-off to his subtly accomplished fingerpicked guitar work betrays a casual ideal, even as couplets like, ""I knew, I knew I could stand tall/ I could lay low,"" seem typically Banhartian in their benign whimsy. Likewise, the short guitar instrumental ""Tit Smoking in the Temple of Artesan Mimicry"" seems strangely familiar in its relaxed, uncomplicated feel, as Banhart's deceptively intricate lines cross one another like dueling minstrels on the road to nowhere. ""Todo Los Dolores"" even stops down as Banhart forgets the lyrics and has to begin again, much to the chagrin and amusement of a studio companion. If nothing else, Rejoicing in the Hands celebrates the informal and comfortable. Other songs seem weightier. ""When the Sun Shone on Vetiver"" features Banhart accompanying his acoustic with angelic slide guitar, and a ghostly violin harmonizing his lead vocal. The midtempo, folky drone underneath his pseudo-psychedelic melodic vocal phrasing contributes to an unearthly ambience. ""Will Is My Friend"" features plaintive piano and double bass accompaniment, and comes off as a midnight country-blues lament for ""Going Back to California"". Closer ""Autumn's Child"" forgoes guitar almost entirely, featuring Banhart's quivering vocal over a soft, minor-chord piano dirge. Lines like, ""She wanted to leave it, but she could not because it was her own child,"" sound melodramatic on the page, but over the course of song, seem almost offhandedly frank. Rejoicing in the Hands establishes Banhart as a major voice in new folk music. Not only does it improve on the promise of his earlier releases; it effortlessly removes the listener from the context of the recording. That is, it doesn't seem like an album so much as a collection of road hymns and journals, and small tributes to smaller pleasures. If some people miss the appeal of this stuff in an attempt to digest it as any other product, all the better knowing Banhart will probably keep on rejoicing until forever.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/548-rejoicing-in-the-hands/,Young God,2004.0

If you try to sit on air, you're gonna fall, I bet you. And man, I was in a place called Keeprunning, Mississippi onetime, and I heard something on my way. Sounded a little something like raw funk to me, so I slowed down and took a listen. And this is all I could hear: Soul is a ham hock in your cornflakes and a ring around your bathtub. Soul is chitlins foo young and a joint rolled in toilet paper. Soul is you, big mama.

432,The Beatles,Let It Be... Naked,Rock,7.0,November 19 2003,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"""I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey & The Deaf Aids."" ...Or some such convoluted story. All these years after the fact, what is clear is that The Beatles were special mainly because they were dedicated to producing things nobody else could. These songs, the band's persona, the stances they took and lessons learned in front of the camera weren't just the exploits of a popular band, but live memoirs of the spiritual, artistic and disciplined Ideal. For each word written and photo taken of all manner of celebrities, they are still arguably the only group of musicians worth talking about with the same significance as any world leader or religious icon you care to name-- at least in the West. Bigger than Jesus? All you need is love, and there is nothing I could write about them that isn't a clichÃ© a hundred times over. Because of this, most folks with a half a brain refuse to write about them in the same boundless way fans and journalists did in the 60s. I suppose this is a wise choice; after all, I'm about as interested in sifting through their complete story right now as I am in reading the dictionary cover-to-cover. Sure, it's ""important,"" if music and people and getting swept up in a minor revolution of love and change is important, but it's too fucking much. Collectively, The Beatles had so many ideas, made so much music, affected so many people, inspired so much good (and bad) that they were necessarily bigger than life. Thus, we're necessarily stuck with tackling this stuff bit by bit. It's a story of looking at things under a microscope, taking things slowly and trying to remember why we were so interested in the first place; it's a story of uncovering some small kernel of their legacy and watching it wind its way back to the center. Everything worthwhile gets back eventually. ""Phase one in which Doris gets her oats."" Paul McCartney is a smug, charmless fuck. Ahem: ""The great thing now about the remixed versions is that, with today's technology, they sound better than ever."" If he had any humility, he'd insert a joke about receiving a bonus CD of outtakes when you ordered now; let's see some testimonials from satisfied customers as they pump their Beatles-themed parties, and claim, ""Listening to this stuff brings back so many memories!"" If his reasons for bringing you the ""real"" Let It Be seem cribbed from an infomercial, one can hardly fault his timing. George Harrison did, in fact, sign off on this release before his death, but given that he actually quit the band during the original sessions, one can only hope McCartney is reaping all his karmic just desserts for this ""naked"" edition. In January 1969, about six weeks after The White Album was released, the band more-or-less agreed that their next project would involve being filmed as they performed their music. Well, at least they agreed they should be filmed; or, they had certainly been open to the idea of all being in the same place at the same time, working on music, possibly making a movie (but ""no movies,"" as Harrison protested) and maybe eventually playing live somewhere in an Arabic desert. Or France. Or maybe on the rooftop of their studios. Oh, and, ""Any of us can do separate things as well and that way it also preserves The Beatles bit."" Hmm, but, ""What we're doing is still rehearsing and we'll get it together."" ""We'll collect our thoughts and you collect yours."" The sessions and rehearsals that eventually produced the original issue of Let It Be have been rightfully documented as disorganized and tension-filled. After spending a month being filmed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg (who they'd already worked with on videos for ""Hey Jude"" and ""Revolution"", among others) as they rehearsed new material, and having put so much sound to tape that no one could be bothered to sift through it all when the time came to deliver an actual product, the band, realizing their defeat, handed it all off to engineer Glyn Johns and moved on to their next project. One original idea for these sessions was merely to be filmed performing songs from The White Album; another was that they should get back to their roots of performing raving rock 'n' roll in front of an audience. Typically, The Beatles' ideas and ambitions far outreached what they could possibly have achieved on their own-- and for the first time since they'd been together, most of them were too tired, distracted or otherwise uninspired to make sure all those ridiculous ideas actually materialized. Johns compiled his version of what the record should be: studio chatter, adlibs, many rough takes of new songs and even off-the-cuff covers. He was chosen because of his work with The Rolling Stones, but only too soon discovered that his new employers operated differently. Even after several modifications and release dates, his compilation was rejected. The tapes were shelved until the band agreed to let legendary producer Phil Spector have a go at squeezing a good record out of them. It should be noted that while The Beatles were only too happy to rid themselves of the burden of Let It Be, they were working with George Martin on Abbey Road in exactly the same way they always had: If perfectionism and pride were forgotten in the winter of '69, apparently they could make amends on a ""proper"" LP. Of course, when the band actually heard what Spector had produced, they balked (well, most of the time, depending on who was arguing with who). Nevertheless, Let It Be was released in January 1970, after Abbey Road, and despite considerable differences of opinion on its ""greatness"" at the time, it has become yet another canonical set of Beatle music. So what did Spector produce? First, he added a couple of songs, including an old throwaway by Lennon called ""Across the Universe"", which was originally from 1968 and had recently been released on a charity compilation called No One's Gonna Change Our World. Secondly, he beefed up some of the rather sparse arrangements with ersatz orchestral and choral parts-- much to the fury of McCartney after hearing his ""The Long and Winding Road"" turned into a Hallmark commercial. Never mind that Spector had at least given the band a releasable record, including managing to turn a minute-and-a-half Harrison song fragment into ""I Me Mine"". Given McCartney's famed disgust over the resulting LP, his enthusiasm to issue his idea of how this music should sound shouldn't surprise anyone. Let It Be... Naked is a remixed, resequenced presentation of the most maligned Beatles album, and for better or for worse, will wrap no loose ends whatsoever. ""Don't Let Me Down"" The best news about this record is that the songs themselves have not changed much in 33 years. Those of you who love ""Across the Universe"" and ""Two of Us"" for their elegant simplicity and overwhelming beauty will be happy to know they haven't changed, even if these performances are not the ones to which we've become accustomed. By the same token, I don't think I can ever love ""The Long and Winding Road""; sure, the choirs were a bit much, but then, McCartney didn't really need them to lay on some pretty thick drama. In any case, once over the initial shock of the new song order, Naked will seem very familiar to fans. The sound is perfect, of course. If anything, Naked serves as a great argument for a project to remaster all of the original Beatle albums. Producers Paul Hicks, Guy Massey and Allan Rouse have done an excellent job cleaning up whatever warts were on the original tapes, and presenting these songs in a fresh way without resorting to making them sound overly ""modern."" They've also somehow found a way to make McCartney play in tune, so I can only be grateful for that. Now I must ask: Why? In 2003, there are few people clamoring for an alternate version of Let It Be, and those that are have almost certainly discovered the myriad bootlegs offering every possible combination of halfway-finished covers and studio banter. There is Beatle music yet to be released that should be: My pick would have been a legit issue of their sessions at George's house playing The White Album songs unplugged before recording them. This is music that lends a considerably different light to their music than any remix ever could, and also has the advantage of not being horrifically over-analyzed for the past 30 years. Conversely, Naked is really only interesting as a mild curio, for fighting the boots and for the strangeness of reading a lecture on the wrongs of music-sharing placed within the cover of a Beatles record. ""Riffs are the only thing that will help all of us."" So then, the tunes. To my ears, ""Get Back"" and ""For You Blue"" are unchanged. The difference is that ""Get Back"" now leads off the record, and ""For You Blue"" is slotted third, suggesting McCartney thinks more of it than Spector did. Likewise, ""I Me Mine"" features the same familiar Harrison vocals and guitar lines, but is completely stripped of the cinematic Spector backing arrangement. ""The Long and Winding Road"" also seems mostly the same, minus the orchestra and choir. However, listening more closely, I'm sure this is a different performance; McCartney's vocal wavers slightly and Billy Preston's organ solo gives it a subtle, soulful feel, reminiscent of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" (one of McCartney's favorite songs). However, what's immediately noticeable is the marked clarity of all of these songs. Ringo's hi-hat is crisp, Harrison's Leslie'd asides are in plain sight, rather than being buried by excitable sopranos. Lennon's ""Don't Let Me Down"" wasn't on the original LP but was rehearsed at the same sessions. The band performs it here more uptempo than on the released ""Get Back"" B-side, and generally more ragged-- as is to be expected, given that this was pulled from their famous rooftop performance. Lennon lets loose with some wailing falsetto near the end, and even though they weren't the tightest outfit ever to play, few can deny the contagious enthusiasm they mustered onstage. ""I've Got a Feeling"" and ""One After 909"" are also pulled from the roof concert, and are similarly raw. Still, they're hardly bad recordings and I wonder why the band was so reluctant to release them at the time. The tracks that struck me most on Naked were ""Let It Be"" and ""Across the Universe"". The former because it seems very much improved with this remix; the Harrison guitar solo is new, so this is likely a different version than was released originally, and the hymnal-esque backing vocals are gorgeously placed across the aural plane in the mix. These are the kinds of changes that make Naked an interesting listen for longtime fans, and raise the question of the powers that be possibly issuing a full-length project of Beatles remixes wherein drastic changes are made to songs without the obligation of placing the project alongside the rest of their proper LPs, as if this is the way they were ""meant"" to be. That said, ""Across the Universe"" is the same (slowed-down) vocal and guitar from Let It Be, but with more reverb and soft sitar-like sounds. Though there's already a beautiful, lesser-known version of this track available (an elaborate George Martin-produced studio version with a background children's choir and bird chirps), this take eclipses the already beautiful original Let It Be version as the second-best performance of the song. Let It Be... Naked also comes with a second disc entitled Fly on the Wall, consisting of several short fragments of studio conversation and song rehearsals, amounting to approximately 21 minutes of bonus material. This disc will doubtless be fascinating to fans, and in particular the snippets of John performing a very early version of ""Imagine"" (here referenced as ""John's Piano Piece""), and a short, striking version of Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"", obviously influenced by his time spent with Bob Dylan and The Band in America the previous year. However, given that the entire two-disc set runs less than an hour, I wonder why it wasn't condensed to a single disc. Furthermore, if a 21-minute outtakes collection deserves its own bonus disc, why not expand this material to fill the rest of the CD? Apparently, releasing two versions of Let It Be make more sense to the remaining Beatles than giving fans something new. ""Let It Be"" Ultimately, Naked is not essential. Unlike scattered moments in the Anthology series, this music, though immaculately presented, doesn't really expand on either the music of Let It Be, or The Beatles' legacy. At this point, I'm not sure many people are prepared to accept a new take on the band anyway, but I might at least be happy knowing they didn't take me for a raving completist. And yet, I stood in line for this, just like millions of other like-minded fans will, merely for the chance to hear some small kernel leading me back to the reason I started listening in the first place. The albums will always be there, and the legend will forever be imprinted on the hearts of anyone believing in the affirming power of their music. In the end, regardless of what I write, this is The Beatles, and you already know what that means.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1093-let-it-be-naked/,Capitol,2003.0
433,Miles Davis,The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions,Jazz,8.6,October 14 2003,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"In the spring of 1970, Miles Davis was fresh off his trailblazing, artistic watermarks In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew, and focusing on the development of his live show. His band included some of the greatest session musicians in jazz at the time: bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, and drummer Jack DeJohnette, and all were helping Miles to push the musical ideas he'd introduced on his records into uncharted territory in concert. But he was also very much inspired by the concept of using recording studios as compositional instruments, and when he set out to create the soundtrack to an obscure documentary on boxing icon Jack Johnson, it turned out he had many more ideas than could possibly find their way onto two sides of a single LP. Following in the vein of Miles' recently issued Complete Sessions box sets for In a Silent Way or Bitches Brew (and featuring more raw material than either), this new five-disc collection shows a man consumed with evaluating the arsenal at his disposal. That meant recording countless takes on a theme, and, with assistance from producer Teo Macero, splicing those takes together into one coherent 40-minute release: 1971's A Tribute to Jack Johnson. But now, this compilation documents the sessions in their virtual entirety (there are a couple of missing takes, but nothing too essential), offering an incredible six hours of largely unheard material. As with the previous boxes from this era, fans will delight in hearing just about everything the musicians put to tape, as well as paging through the invaluable session info, extensive liner notes, and unseen photos included in the extensive and beautiful packaging. Obviously, though, anyone who hasn't heard and loved the original Jack Johnson album should check that out before dropping $60 on this exhaustive collection. Disc one opens with several takes from a February 1970 session of the misleadingly titled ""Willie Nelson"" (it is, in fact, a Miles Davis original)-- much of which was incorporated into the original LP's largely ambient piece ""Yesternow"". The band, which here features Miles, Corea, Holland, DeJohnette, bass clarinetist Bernie Maupin, and guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, set up a downbeat-heavy groove that reminds me of Funkadelic's ""Music for Your Mother"", if much less drugged-out. Davis enters about 40 seconds into ""Willie Nelson (Take 2)"" with a typically elongated phrase before settling into his ""jab"" motif with Maupin. Each take of the song offered here center around melodies similar to this one-- the real differences lie in Sharrock's, Miles' and Maupin's solos. It's a great way to kick off the set, if not quite as fiery a start as the original LP's ""Right Off"". Later that month, Miles reconvened with a smaller band, keeping his rhythm section fully intact, but trading in Sharrock, Corea and Maupin for 19-year-old saxophonist Steve Grossman. They recorded a couple of speedier takes of ""Willie Nelson"" that boast more colorful McLaughlin lines and Grossman's pleasantly spooky soprano. Miles also gives some great solos, even sporting some of his bebop chops at times-- sax player Gary Bartz, a member of Charles Mingus' Jazz Workshop and soloist on Miles' Live/Evil, said that some of the most exciting moments during the shows that eventually comprised the 1974 live offering Dark Magus were when Miles would reach back into history to pull out some of his old runs, and they certainly shine here. This band also tries out three versions of a tune called ""Johnny Bratton"" (previously unreleased, and starting the run of songs titled after boxers), a very rock-centric piece that sounds a bit like they were unsure of how to really nail this style. ""Johnny Bratton (Insert 1)"" is basically straight-ahead rock pounding (something like a fusion approximation of ""Louie, Louie"") with McLauglin doing his best to ensure that any tonal center is wiped out, and Holland entering with some admirable fuzz-wah bass playing. In early March, Miles again headed into the studio with this same band to cut ""Archie Moore"" and several versions of ""Go Ahead John"". The former tune is a hard blues number with some very potent lines from McLaughlin-- in fact, Miles and Grossman sit this one out entirely, allowing the trio to bring it home like a seasoned rock band. Five takes of ""Go Ahead John"" pop up on disc two, showcasing Miles' midnight cool melody. The first part is a sparse, somber exercise in minimal blues, and features McLaughlin reeling off short, staccato statements similar to the ones played by Sharrock on the first disc. The second part of the tune is an odd combination of jittery funk and acid-rock, with DeJohnette playing a prehistoric drum-n-bass pattern and Holland holding a single bass note while McLaughlin shreds on the right. All five performances were later edited into a version released on 1974's Big Fun. Mid-March saw Miles lay down two takes of the previously unissued ""Duran"" with McLaughlin, Holland, Maupin, soprano saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and drummer Billy Cobham. Miles' band was certainly getting a better idea of how to construct ""simple"" funk, as the basic, syncopated groove here could have been played (though never written) by any number of funk bands at the time. However, the robo-tight interplay of Cobham and Holland, along with McLaughlin's ever-edgy solos, make it much more interesting than just any ordinary breakdown. Miles reports, ""that's some raunchy shit, y'all,"" and he's right. These guys (exit Cobham, enter future Return to Forever drummer Lenny White) also did the stop-time, angular funk tune ""Sugar Ray"", which Bill Mulkowski's liner notes curiously describe as ""Devoesque"" and ""proto-punk."" It sounds more like The Meters playing head games to me. As April came around, Miles re-entered the studio with McLaughlin, Cobham, Grossman and Mike Henderson, a teenage bassist from Aretha Franklin's band, to record ""Right Off"" and the first half of ""Yesternow"". These two songs, of course, ended up serving as the tracklist on the original Jack Johnson LP, and anyone familiar with that record can attest to just how beautifully they pulled off ""Right Off""'s uptempo shuffle, with McLaughlin's aggressive outcomping transforming the track from a merely interesting jazz experiment to full-on streetwise fusion. Herbie Hancock dropped by the studio as well (from the grocery store!) and got talked into laying down a fuzz-fried solo on Farfisa, a kind of organ he'd never played before. The track ended up purely celebratory, and the four takes on disc three provide just about every solo angle you could want. The two lengthy takes of ""Yesternow"" offered here are masterful runs into electric ambience, but inevitably not quite as interesting as Macero's final album edit. In May, Miles added Keith Jarrett and percussionist Airto Moreira to the mix, cutting versions of ""Honky Tonk"" and ""Ali"". A short excerpt of ""Honky Tonk"" ended up on Live/Evil, but until now, the track has never been released in its entirety. Shame, too, because it's an excellent slice of blues-rock: Miles plays with confidence using an octave pedal while McLaughlin peals out still more spiky color for Jarrett to run rampant over. Considering that Jack Johnson would be Miles' last studio recording until On the Corner over two years later, it's hard to believe this song wasn't issued somewhere along the line. ""Ali"", leading off disc four, sees the same band (here including longtime Elvin Jones collaborator Gene Perla, who nicks a riff from Hendrix's ""Who Knows"") following a groove similar to that of ""Willie Nelson"", but with a much better idea of how to flesh it out. And then there's ""Konda"", which the guys recorded without a bassist at all, and which didn't see release until 1981's Directions compilation. Jarrett's opening solo on electric piano perfectly sets up Miles' eerie, beautiful melody, and McLaughlin's harmonic work is practically unearthly, helping to make this track one of the box set's coolest pieces. Miles followed this muse a few days later for takes on Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal's ""Nem Um Talvez"". Neither of the versions here are the one from Live/Evil, though the second is remarkably close. Miles wrapped recording in June, but not before taking most of the band from May's sessions (adding old friends Hancock and bassist Ron Carter) back into the studio for one last go at ""Nem Um Talvez"", three other Pascoal pieces (""Little High People"", ""Selim"", ""Little Church""), and another Davis original titled ""The Mask"". All of Pascoal's ballads seem to advance the side of Miles' music best heard on In a Silent Way, and serve notice to anyone who thought he'd abandoned that style for good at the turn of the decade. Unfortunately, ""Little High People"" is almost distractingly straightforward, at least in principal: The uptempo pop/rock groove brings Hancock's organ transmissions down to earth, and keeps Miles' wah-wah solos a bit too in check. Meanwhile, ""Selim"" (really just ""Nem Um Talvez"" with a different title) ended up on Live/Evil, along with the two versions of ""Little Church"" found on this set's fifth disc. Dave Holland came back to the fold to record both parts of the previously unreleased ""The Mask"": the first is a very out, keyboard-heavy free-jam with little assistance from Miles or McLaughlin, while the second-- hardly easy listening-- closes the sessions with an exhausted, punchdrunk swagger, finally collapsing after nearly 16 minutes. The box, however, ends on a high note, with the original LP versions of ""Right Off"" and ""Yesternow"". I hesitate to go through them blow by blow because anyone investing in this box will almost certainly have already heard them many times over. Which, ultimately, is my only real caveat to The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions: there's more of interest here to fans; for a casual listener to tackle all five discs would be commendably ambitious, but an arduous challenge nonetheless. This set ranks behind both the Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way boxes in terms of the amount of music I'd want to just let play, uninterrupted. However, Miles Davis is one of those rare musicians who rarely failed to let a take pass without trying out something cool. As usual, the deeper you dig, the more you find.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2200-the-complete-jack-johnson-sessions/,Columbia Legacy,2003.0
434,N.W.A.,Straight Outta Compton,Rap,9.7,October 2 2003,Ray Suzuki,Contributor,"Last week I was buying some detergent at a local laundromat in rural Nebraska. This is what was occupying my mind: ""See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem/ I see a motherfuckin' cop, I don't dodge him."" Now, based on my limited experience with law enforcement, I've found most cops to be cordial, beneficent protectors of the law. Yet, at that moment, I didn't just want to fuck tha police, both physically and figuratively; I wanted them lynched, drenched in gasoline, and burnt alive. It's one thing to get a catchy couplet stuck in teenagers' heads; it's another to convert half the nation into murderous psychopaths hell-bent on riot and rape. N.W.A. accomplished the latter. Straight Outta Compton was not the first gangsta-rap album, nor was it the first album to use such disconcerting and scabrous blasts of sound, but the music was revolutionary for two reasons. First, Dre and Yella took the vitriolic, cacophonous rampage of Public Enemy and discarded all the motivation and history behind the anger; second, they sampled laid-back jazz, psychoastral-lovetron p-funk, sweetly romantic soul, naïve doo-wop, Martha Reeves, Charles Wright and Marvin Gaye, and proceeded to lay it under the most gruesome narratives imaginable, dead ho's and cop killers. This is tantamount to using a ""Happy B-Day, Grandma"" Hallmark card to inform a family you just slaughtered their grandmother. It's cruel, duplicitous, perverse, horrifying, hilarious. In some ways, Straight Outta Compton is the archetypal rap album, the one you would send into space if you wanted to ignite a stellar holocaust. It unites the paranoia of It Takes a Nation of Millions with the chill of The Chronic, while still retaining an old-school, Run-DMC-style playfulness. The opening squall of ""Straight Outta Compton"", ""Fuck tha Police"", and ""Gangsta Gangsta"" is still as confrontational and decimating as it was at the dawn of the 1990s. The bass throttles, the funk combusts, and the sirens deafen as Eazy-E dispenses with tired romantic clichés: ""So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!/ You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't no sucker!"" And this is the least misogynistic of N.W.A.'s albums. In the remaining ten tracks, the group depicts a paranoid, conspiratorial wasteland where cops ""think every nigga is sellin' narcotics,"" where they often are selling narcotics to buy gats to kill cops, where bitches have two functions in life-- to suck dick and get shot when they stop-- and where there are two only professions: bein' a punk and shootin' punks. The mind itself is a ghetto, and the ghetto is universal. A lot of people, for whatever reason, take offense to such ideas. William S. Burroughs writes the same thing and gets hailed as the greatest writer of the twentieth century. There is no hope, no messages, no politics, rarely an explicit suggestion of irony. The only respite is ""Express Yourself"", the sweetest anti-drug song to ever take place in a correctional facility. Musically, the rhythm pummels and the scratches are strong but sparse; lyrically, Dre says it best: ""It gets funky when you got a subject and a predicate."" For all the genius, there are some tracks that simply can't compare to the classics. ""If It Ain't Ruff"", ""8 Ball"", and ""Dopeman"" are triumphant rap songs, but they consist of minimalist beats and the silly battle raps that N.W.A. helped eliminate. Efil4Zaggin, meanwhile, is about as close as you can come to a death metal/hip-hop hybrid. People will get hurt here. The group, sans-Cube, is simply trying to further their status as icons of shock-rap. Unlike someone like Alice Cooper or Marilyn Manson, though, N.W.A. sound like they've actually gone insane: The song titles alone (""To Kill a Hooker"", ""One Less Bitch"", ""Find 'Em, Fuck 'Em and Flee"") are enough to send some people into seizures. I have no idea what Eazy-E was doing between albums, but it clearly involved a lot of sadomasochism and PCP-- his lyrics are revoltingly unlistenable: ""Yo, I tied her to the bed/ I had to let my niggaz fuck her first/ Loaded up the 44, yo/ Then I straight smoked the ho/ 'Cause I'm a real nigga."" The main musical motif is the Psycho theme. The songs here sound like the Bomb Squad in the graveyard Superfly got buried in. ""Approach to Danger"" is essentially rapping over a Halloween FX record. It's complexly debauched, fantastically jagged terror-hop that at its best challenges anything on Fear of a Black Planet and at its worst challenges anything off Dre's 2001. It's also much funnier than Straight Outta Compton. Eazy-E's Ten Commandments on ""Appetite for Destruction"" set the bar so high on his first command that he can barely think of enough vices to finish it. In the skit ""Protest"", an N.W.A. concert turns into a scene from Platoon. Eazy also sings on two tracks, one of which (""Automobile"") may as well be titled ""With a Little Help from Your Pussy"". Ten seconds can barely pass before someone is murdered or raped. It's the sound of an expletive anger at its breaking point. The reissues sound pretty tight, but high-quality audio was never really the point. The supplementary tracks are a more interesting point of discussion. Straight Outta Compton adds extended mixes of ""Express Yourself"" and ""Straight Outta Compton"". The former may be a better song, but only because it uses more of the Wright sample, whereas the latter regrettably decides to disturb the propulsion of the original by inserting spoken dialogue. The B-side, ""A Bitch Iz a Bitch"", however, is one of Cube's finest moments, beginning as a specification of what he means when he curses, and ending with a tirade against a ""contact-wearin' bitch."" Efil4Zaggin just adds the 100 Miles and Runnin' EP, which is fairly superfluous. The title track, though, is easily one of the best rap songs of all time-- N.W.A. if commissioned to write a James Bond theme. Listening to these discs again just remind me how ludicrous the whole Eminem controversy was. More than a decade ago, N.W.A. was instructing suburbia to smash bitches' brains in with a cock in one hand and a glock in the other. In comparison, Eminem's harshest lyric ends up sounding like, ""I may slightly disagree with certain tenets of popular ideologies."" When Eminem rapes and kills his mom, it's because of a long-standing psychological disorder that relies on a complicated relationship with his family. When Eazy-E does it, it's because nothing good was on TV that night. These are the most nihilistic, apolitical recordings since the Nixon tapes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11791-straight-outta-compton-efil4zaggin/,"Priority,Priority,Priority,Priority",1988.0
435,OutKast,Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,Rap,8.0,September 22 2003,Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,"The twelve-lane Connector plows through Atlanta like the Nile of pavement. Along its fenced banks lie the majority of the city's attractions. Turner buildings, blossoming with neon network logos, lure Yellowjacket grads from the adjacent campus cluster with the sweet nectar of Powerpuff Girls money. Across the way, The Varsity serves grease between buns, communicating with an enigmatic fast food lexicon that rivals rhyming Cockneys. Tourists walk the overpass to the ghostly Olympic park, built on the graveyard of Techwood projects, in the shadows of Vick's pastel dome. Hipsters and reluctant yuppies settle in the gentrified Five Points and Cabbagetown, giving their quaint subdivisions more verdant ""___________ Park"" monikers. And finally, there's Turner Field, reverberating collective October sighs, before the highway splits back into its tributaries in East Point, the cultural fountainhead. The hip-hop id to New York's ego: the home of Outkast. Lauded retroactively in 2000, upon the release of Stankonia, for a formula that had been perfected by teenagers on 1994's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Outkast charged up the public with silly amounts of reserved anticipation for this double-disc marathon. Since dropping that debut nearly ten years ago, Outkast's singles have charted a steady incline of genre-defiance and pop virtuosity. But now, in the wake of the commercial and critical smash that yielded such classic tracks as ""Ms. Jackson"", ""B.O.B."", and ""So Fresh, So Clean"", Big Boi and Andre 3000 have, for the first time, chosen to work in separate corners, like Beatles after India. Here, on the resulting Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, the two wander down the blacktop from East Point, each plotting their own distinct course: Andre, like I-85, shoots off to the airport and sky-high trips before dipping into the Mardi Gras marshes of New Orleans, while Big Boi rolls deep down I-75 into south Florida, home of booty bass and baby blue. The consensus in rock circles had unfairly anticipated that The Love Below would reign supreme over Big Boi's Speakerboxxx, since Andre was the one with the guitar in the fuzzy boots. As it turns out, his Prince-mimicking fusion looks a lot better on paper than it sounds in your ears. On too many songs, Andre repeats space-playboy choruses over repetitious, unfinished digifunk. As the brief orchestrated outro to ""Pink and Blue"" suggests, each track feels like it's missing something-- strings, guitars, harmonies, organic instruments, and, oh right: Big Boi. Andre does have his moment, though: ""Hey Ya!"" glitters and towers like the silver Westin hotel over an 80s Atlanta skyline, blending Flaming Lips-like synth-bass and ebullient acoustic guitar with the rebellious joy of ""Little Red Corvette""-- and like all classic songs, it introduces new vernacular with a genius that transcends product placement. Even indymedia.org feeders will shout ""Polaroid!"" while miming spanking at this fall's Not-Dog cookouts. Of the few other tracks on The Love Below that come close to reaching ""Hey Ya!""'s apex, the one that most succeeds is ""Spread"", which showcases trumpets and piano weaving through a rubber bassline and scattering rimshots. Its chorus has Andre putting on his Camille voice, while the verses contain some of the only moments on the album in which he actually flows. When he does, he's tight enough to pose the question of why he decided to cut back on rapping at all-- particularly since, frankly, he ranks just above Pharrell Williams on the ""brilliant but mosquito-throated crooner"" list. Elsewhere, the quite literal ""Dracula's Wedding"" boasts guest vocalist Kelis over whistling squelches, while Norah Jones' lovely turn on the acoustic ""Take Off Your Cool"" hints at the true stylistic breadth Andre is capable of achieving. ""Baby, take off your cool/ I want to get to know you,"" they both sing over plucks and strums. Heed your lyrics, Andre. (Except for that ""become the master of your own bastion"" nonsense.) Big Boi's Speakerboxxx coolly upstages its counterpart: Although it, too, provides the world with one earthshaking single, it differs from The Love Below in that it also manages to maintain a consistent level of brilliance and emotional complexity. Here, Big Boi effectively asserts himself as man who wants both a stripper pole in his home and his nostalgic place saved on the pew-- ""Unhappy"" conveys that in its beat alone! Comparing the selection of Speakerboxxx to Andre's limper Love Below, it's clear who won this bet: Machine-heavy, horn-driven funk stomps behind ""Bowtie"" and ""The Rooster""; reverberating woodblocks (a trademark Outkast signifier since ""Elevators"") starkly soundtrack pondering rhymes on ""Knowing""; ""Church"" takes gospel into the 21st Century, accelerating aluminum Stevie Wonder disco-pop into Teutonic techno; propulsive kickdrums pump under drunken guitars, scratches, and a Jay-Z hook on the standout ""Flip Flop Rock""; and ""Ghettomusick"", the aforementioned earthshaking single, is, emotionally, a celebration and a lament, braggadocio and beatitudes. Musically, the record shifts from punk-cadenced, cellulite-quivering woofer booms to three-wheeled slow-jams and back before snake-charming with George Clinton keyboards. Of course, there's one department in which neither disc succeeds: Despite how forward-looking these albums can be, both members have failed to envision a future without skits and intros, which make up no less than ten of the 39 tracks here. It's one reason why Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, like no albums before, beg to be ripped, sieved and re-sequenced. Cutting out the dialog, along with The Love Below's silicon-smooth, Rainbow Children-esque jazz and lulling middle-section, and Big Boi's guest-laden, been-there street tracks, leaves one genius full-length that fits on a single disc.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/,Arista,2003.0
436,My Morning Jacket,It Still Moves,Rock,8.3,September 17 2003,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"It's that moment every indie kid irrationally fears: your favorite band gets the call-up to the majors. Now that they've come to prominence via the California-based indie Darla Records, it's My Morning Jacket's turn to risk their careers and financial stability for a shot at recording a real statement album backed by a serious budget. But something's not right here, or maybe something's too right: Jim James' high, lonesome croon is still recorded in a grain silo, and the band's sound is still a cathedral of reverb, but where you might expect grandiose 40-piece orchestras, bombastic gospel choirs and glossy, state-of-the-art digital effects, you will find only the vast, empty space that has always accompanied the band's instrumentation, allowing each note to resonate indefinitely, unhampered by unnecessary density. Rest assured, the faithful will have no problem kneeling here. Last year's exploratory Chocolate & Ice EP left quite a few open questions about the band's future direction, many signals of which could be found in the 24-minute electro-funk centerpiece ""Cobra"". But It Still Moves almost immediately confirms that the spacy Southern psych that My Morning Jacket built their name on remains their bread and butter. ""Mahgeetah"" is full of the long, drawn-out vocals that made ""Can You See the Hard Helmet on My Head?"" such an affecting and seemingly meaningful question; it also carries over the texture of that song, building a small epic out of the same elements. The band reacts to each verse differently-- once with explosions of glimmering arpeggios, later with Johnny Quaid's beautiful, understated guitar solo-- before bringing the whole thing to one of those thunderous conclusions that makes classic rock live albums such a guilty pleasure. ""Golden"" trots through a glowing haze of reverb on Patrick Hallahan's steadily brushed beat, its lilting finger-picking and ghostly harmonies falling somewhere between The Band's stately Canadicana and The Byrds' ""Ballad of Easy Rider"". ""One Big Holiday"" doesn't look like much from the lyrics in the liners, but when James grabs hold of the opening line, ""Wakin' up feeling good and limber,"" and draws it out in his singular way, it feels about a million times more weighty than it probably should. Near the album's midpoint, the reverb reaches such titanic proportions that James' drifting vocals begin to rival Sigur RÃ³s' Jon Thor Birgisson for shear ethereality, particularly on a track like ""I Will Sing You Songs"". It's like listening in the throes of a lucid dream. ""Easy Morning Rebel"" puts your feet back on the ground with its swinging arrangement and Memphis horns (actually played by veteran Stax session men-- one of the rare frills here made available by major label dollars). And then, finally, the band leaves James alone in his silo to close the album with the searching, desperate ""One in the Same"", a song that finds him seemingly trying to sort fragmented memories into coherent thoughts. When he hits the lines, ""It wasn't till I woke up/ That I could hold down a joke or a job or a dream/ But then all three are one in the same,"" it should put a lump in your throat. And with that, It Still Moves strums to a close, an album by turns beautiful and possessed, by others raucous and fiery. If you're standing by the record racks trying to choose between this and the band's other major achievement, At Dawn, flip a coin; either way, you win. My Morning Jacket have made the move to the bigs in tremendous style, and as far as I can tell they haven't compromised a thing to be there. If there's one major flaw I could point to here, it'd be the album's length-- 74 minutes is a long runtime for any record, and as a result, the album is usually better off listened to in chunks-- but that's a small concern considering the riches that await inside.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5531-it-still-moves/,"BMG,ATO",2003.0
437,David Bowie,Reality,Rock,7.3,September 16 2003,Eric Carr,Contributor,"""There is a reason the present begrudges the past,"" writes Harlan Ellison; I won't pretend to be wise enough to know what that reason is, but I believe that statement to be true, regardless. The evidence is plain in just about anyone beyond a certain age, the all-consuming, epic oldness where a person can say ""when I was your age"" without a trace of irony. It hits some people as early as twenty or so, when they suddenly find themselves on the downhill side of life, confronted with a bleak realization that things were a whole lot greener back when they were still climbing (or before they knew any better, at least). Some people, they just never stop climbing; it's rare, but it happens. A great many of David Bowie's fans, with each successive year, slowly but surely creep into the former category even as Bowie himself manages to still act like a card-carrying member of the latter. ""I'm never never gonna get old,"" he proclaims on the Toys 'R' Us-inspired ""Never Get Old"", and to his credit, he makes yet another convincing argument. With one exception (the hokey, one-foot-in-the-grave Hours), Bowie-- even in his advanced age (by fresh-faced rock standards), even after almost a trillion records-- has never dwelled unduly on his past. If anything, while people will always hold him up to his past accomplishments, his career has floundered more than once out of his desire for self-conscious avant-gardism and an almost schizophrenic need to reinvent his persona. What last year's Heathen implied, and what Reality seems to prove, is that those days are over; never looking back, and no longer focusing ahead, Bowie has finally joined us all in the present, mind-young as ever but old enough not to make a show of it. And then, if you'll grant this indulgence, there's me, the one who's supposed to be writing about him: ""Plain Ol' 'Dave'"" baffles me. Bowie's work is traditionally seen in a terrifically damaging binary-- common law states that if his work isn't brilliant, it's terrible; that's obviously wrong, since there're plenty of gray areas to be found in Bowie's oeuvre, but it's easy as hell to fall into the trap. Not much can stack up to Hunky Dory or Scary Monsters, after all. But then he goes and releases, consecutively, the two most earnest, unpretentious albums he's ever dreamed up, and the Pocket Dichotomy that had been used so frequently to dismiss Outside, Earthling, and others, is now terminally, irrevocably broken. Heathen looked like it might've been a holding pattern on the way to greater heights, but only for rising from the ashes of Hours; Reality shows that instead, Bowie is not aiming for an unattainable Ziggy-caliber alien classic, but is simply going to rock like any other human, in a pleasantly mild, non-conformist manner. This is as close as Bowie has ever come to simply ""pretty good"" in his storied career. A zealous few will say that he's just further ahead of the curve than anyone can see, but if that's so, then what lies ahead is MOR rock and roll, with producer Tony Visconti's unobtrusive, light-handed electronic flourishes as gloss; no way-- he's too talented to be overtly influenced or obviously faddish, but that doesn't mean he's breaking ground. That's not an insult. I feel the biggest strength of this album is how relaxed it is, how well this anti-pose suits Bowie. It's freed him to craft some of the finest original material he's done in quite a while; Heathen best expressed his singular vision through the compositions of others, but Reality's original material easily overshadows its covers. In particular, the George Harrison-penned ""Try Some, Buy Some"", though a kind tribute to Bowie's recently deceased contemporary, might be the album's only real mistake. Sappy, vacant lyrics and plodding, waltz-timed orchestration give a feel similar to a more fleshed-out version of the Morrissey cover ""I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday"", but without any the self-referential poignancy invested in the latter. The deep-space broadcast of ""Pablo Picasso"" is a substantial improvement, in terms of covers, with its echoing trills and white-funk syncopation and the intense surrealism of hearing the words ""Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole/ Not like you,"" come from Bowie's mouth, but David promised that Reality would ""rock"", and he proceeds to do so even more effectively elsewhere. Hard-edged dynamics are supplied to direct, aggressive rhythms on numerous tracks like the supremely nervous, desperate ""Looking for Water"" and less obviously on the epic jazz kick ""Bring Me the Disco King"", but only ""New Killer Star"" feels like more than an exercise with slightly dusty rock standbys. It opens the album with a bassline etched indelibly within our genetic make-up, instantly recognizable and irresistible, and once the hook is set, a deluge of static-hazed background singers, weird robo-choruses, and a shaky treble riff that easily marks the album's finest moment simply spew forth from the speakers, overwhelming all but the most cynical of Bowie's detractors. At least, that's what I predict. Also worthy of mention is the stark contrast provided by ""The Loneliest Guy"". It sounds like the title to a forgotten Dudley Moore flick, and may sound somewhat like disingenuous fame lament coming from Bowie, but the song itself will dispel those thoughts. Nearly a cappella, with bare hints of strings and stray piano chords fading in from other rooms, Bowie instead offers that he's ""the luckiest guy/ Not the loneliest guy/ In the world/ Not me,"" but does so with such mournful uncertainty that no easy reading of the song is possible; it seems surprisingly human, bittersweet, and altogether far more real than its name implies. It's startlingly out of place, sandwiched between ""Never Get Old"" and ""Looking for Water"", so much so that it almost implies sarcasm, but that's fitting, as this is as eclectic and puzzling album as Bowie's ever made. He's not always at the top of his game, but Bowie's musical ideas, not filtered through any sort of trend-grab, are unfailingly unique, and that alone should cement his continued role as vibrant, modern artist for years to come.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/,Sony,2003.0
438,James Brown,In the Jungle Groove,Rock,8.6,August 7 2003,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"James Brown turned 70 this year, and while most great-grandparents are settling down on their lake house patio, or complaining about the nursing home food, last I heard, James was busy scaring the shit out of solicitors at his South Carolina home. With that in mind, it's good to know his legacy and legend are in safe keeping via his music, and the myriad compilations detailing the facets of his genius. In the Jungle Groove was originally issued in 1986, just as interest in Brown's backbeats reawakened via the power of sampling in hip-hop, and cut for cut, it's in the highest category of Brown compilations, standing tall alongside any of his greatest hits sets (and even the Star Time box). It's not that it necessarily covers a lot of ground, or even gives a good overall view of Brown's career-- because it really only spans a short period from late 1969 until mid 1971, with a bonus track from 1972 added for this reissue-- but those years were particularly fertile, and this set nails them. The early 70s is generally viewed as Brown's last really great period, but it's not without problems. For starters, his band underwent two complete overhauls: after working with the same basic core since about 1964 (with minor fluctuations as during Maceo and Melvin Parker's military stints), mutiny reared its ugly head in the spring of 1970. With trombonist Fred Wesley checking out to L.A., Maceo took his ball and the rest of the band and went on the road his own damn self. Without anyone to back him, Brown was in dire straights-- that is until right hand man Bobby Byrd called long-distance to the Cincinnati residence of William (""Bootsy"") and Phelps Collins. Along with longtime associate Sir Clyde Stubblefield, the new groove was formed, and dubbed the JB's. That is, until Bootsy started having horrific acid experiences onstage, and fell out with Brown in the process. When Wesley returned, and regulars like St. Clair Pinckney and John ""Jabo"" Starks climbed back onboard, the JB's were officially retooled and managed to stick it out until the mid-70s. Hardest working men in show business, indeed. In the Jungle Groove runs through all of that via ten pretty amazing tracks that manage to sound like one huge break despite the clamor behind the scenes. ""It's A New Day"" leads things off on a particularly upbeat note, even for these guys. Brown makes his case for letting ""the girls know what they can do for us"" before Jimmy Nolen drops a very funky Stax-esque guitar lick and the horns hit their thing. When the drums come in and the handclaps slap, I do believe the portion of cosmos located right above my house is aligned. We're one song in, and the fucking cosmos is aligned. ""Can I get a witness?"" By all means, and then serve up ""Funky Drummer"". Of all the songs here, ""Funky Drummer"" is easily the most heard, even if only for Stubblefield's still-unholy-after-all-these-years break. What's not so known is the understated, but cutting solo by Maceo and Brown's own wildly unhinged organ touches. The Bootsy years are represented by a very hot remix of ""Give It Up or Turn It Loose"", ""I Got to Move"", ""Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing"", ""Get Up, Get Into It and Get Involved"" and ""Soul Power"". ""Give It Up"" in particular stands out, thanks to the whiplash sound of Stubblefield's drums and Bootsy's restless, but tight bass lines. There's a break in the middle where the band drops out and only Brown's orders to ""clap your hands, stomp your feet"" and Johnny Griggs' congas are keeping the beat alive. When Brown gives the signal (""Clyde!""), and the drums re-enter, dollars to donuts you're out the window with funky joy (or calling for the Neptunes' heads for their complete rip of this trick-- ""drums!""-- for Justin Timberlake, of all people). ""Talkin' Loud"" also gets a new shine via the remix treatment, as the golden tag team of Stubblefield, Collins and Nolen get their rocks off and then some. James Brown isn't really the kind of artist who needs his stuff beefed up, but here it only serves to make a very good thing harder and hotter. The final track is the previously unreleased, extended version of ""Blind Man Can See It"", originally a part of Brown's soundtrack to the blaxploitation flick Black Caesar. Jabo Starks keeps everything very much in the pocket here, as Brown is content to run amok off-mic around the studio. The mostly-instrumental jam keeps fairly calm (and the Rhodes asides are key), and if not for Nolen's rampantly sampled guitar line and Brown's ending soliloquy lamenting the lack of gigs around, this could probably pass for straight ahead acid-jazz funkateering. It's perhaps not in the same stratospheric pantheon as other cuts on the set, but like pretty much everything Brown did during this time, it gets the job done easily. There are a few very good compilations available covering Brown's pure funk period: besides this one, be sure to check out the James Brown's Funky People series, Funk Power 1970, Make It Funky: The Big Payback and the two-disc JB's anthology. All of them are incredible, and emphasize slightly different aspects of his (and his band's) music from the late 60s and early 70s. However, times are tight, and if you only have room for one on your shelf, you couldn't do much better than this CD.

439,Metallica,St. Anger,Metal,0.8,June 15 2003,Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,"A twisted barbed wire sign spans the entrance to the Ben Elektra Kibbutz in Metulla, Israel. It reads: ""And Justice for All."" There, in the country's northernmost town, pinched by Lebanon, and set in a valley as arid and colorless as an Anton Corbijn photo, my brothers and I assembled compact discs for Elektra Records, far from the reach of cable modems and CDRWs. After long days of picking rare bloodberries from barbed bushes for the screened St. Anger covers, which Lars assured us during his weekly motivational videos would only drive hard copy sales, I stripped my soiled black overalls, checked the bunks for banana spiders and sand ants, and settled in to read a tattered copy of Karl ""Geezer"" Marx and Frederick ""Freddi"" Engels' Metal Manifesto. Few historians care to document the period in the early 1850s when the pair, influenced by the heart-wrenching blue-collar poems of Bob Seger, abandoned the Bund der Gerechten, shaved their beards, applied eye-silver and rouge, and produced a series of simpler, populist manifestos. Often, I found myself reading the first line by Zippolight, unable to proceed further, lulling myself to sleep with its mantra: ""A spectre is haunting Metal - the spectre of Metallica."" Decades removed from its writing I didn't find the assertion particularly leveling or insightful. Rather, I was amused by its irony. Originally, Marx and Engels had hoped to shock their staid, academic readers with imagery of the undead, as with the Pushead-inked ""Red Monsta"" devouring Europe on the cover to their earlier Communist Manifesto. Now the word ""spectre"" struck me only as a reminder that Metallica had long given up the ghost. The manifesto remained only a document of arrogance and comedy. Marx continued, ""Metallica is already acknowledged by all Rock powers to be itself a power."" And yet, when MTV recently bestowed Metallica with ""Icon"" status, they could only dredge up Kelly Osbourne, Ja Rule, Sum 41, Godsmack, Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Lisa Marie Presley, and Snoop Dogg in tribute. Time had only made the rest of the text increasingly contradictory and meaningless. Marx and Engels had seen Metal as the antisocial soundtrack that could topple pop for the hearts of the young. ""Pop has converted the guitarist, the songwriter, the drummer, the man behind the boards, into its paid laborers,"" they vented. ""The Major Labels cannot exist without continually revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relation between fans and artists."" I read that last line while seated in a mule cart heading toward the Cardboard Folding Hut. Behind me, shimmering cylinders of stacked St. Anger discs stood in tight rows, an electrical current coursing through them for defense. I snapped the book shut, sickened by the absurdity. If only Marx had lived to see the sides flip over a dwindling battle line. For the first time, a technological advance-- MP3s and digital downloading-- spelled victory for the proletariat. File-sharing had become as anti-establishment as Marx had envisioned metal sounding. And Metallica, Marx's metal champion, had dropped an iron firewall between their music and their fans, who, despite their revolutionary ripping, were, for the most part, bourgeoisie boys choosing bands based on how the logos looked protractor-scratched into study hall desks. We kibbutz workers, who lived here by choice, manufacturing Metallica CDs, faced time in the Lightless Cell if found touching or ""experiencing"" St. Anger before its shipping date. Yet James Hetfield seemed to always sing about being locked inside a Lightless Cell as a badge of honor. Irony upon irony upon irony. Then again, Marx and Engels did grow their beards back and move on to more ambitious projects. A banana spider bit into Ktulu the Mule's heel. The animal reared. The cart spilled its contents, the CDs and myself, into the dust. A safety cut the electrical field protecting St. Anger. As the cart master attempted to rein the bucking animal, I slipped a disc into my overalls. After lights out (or ""enjoy the black"" as it was called), my bunkmates and I listened to the disc for which we had so diligently worked. What an utter mess. I saved 300 boxtops of Of Wolf and Man Cereal and bought a ticket to Israel for this? Lars Ulrich had taken the return to ""real Metal"" quite literally, playing a drumset consisting of steel drums, aluminum toms, programmed double kicks, and a broken church bell. The kit's high-end clamor ignored the basic principles of drumming: timekeeping. Fittingly, Ulrich's scrapyard racket rang senselessly like quickening, imploding industry under filtered, stream-of-clichÃ© riffing. The gimmick overwhelmed entire songs, chiming hollowly over all else. Hetfield and Hammett's guitars underwent more processing than cat food. When they both speedstrummed through ""St. Anger"", and most other movements, H&H; seemed to overwhelm each other with different, terrible noise. A bevy of pedals-- including the decidedly un-metal wah-wah-- jingled conspicuously like a massive charm bracelet... I mean, a string of skulls. A string of iron skulls. A dry, crackling blooze melody squeezed out by Hammett on ""Some Kind of Monster"" brought to mind the time I used my practice amp as a stool in hanging a Ride the Lightning poster over my cot. The amp teetered and toppled, sending my foot right through the speaker cone. From then on I could only produce sounds exact to those on ""Some Kind of Monster"". I just never thought to release them during the kibbutz's mandatory ""riffstorming"" sessions monitored by Hetfield via satellite from his motorcycle factory. Bob Rock's bass neither bobbed nor rocked; it simply hid like an undulating grey amoeboid of sound, much like the web of hate pent inside the mind of the ""Invisible Kid"". ""Invisible Kid"" towered as an example of Metallica's new alloy of ineptitude. In the video feeds streaming throughout the mess hall, Hetfield repeatedly reminded us of the cathartic, psychological process behind St. Anger. This implied a personal, emotional vent. However, Hetfield can only convey feeling through the persona of the implied ""invisible kid"" who cowers from parents and rejection in every song, mirrored in the bedrooms of their audience. Such juvenile confessionals as, ""I hurt inside/ I hide inside/ But I'll show you,"" and, ""Mama, why's it rainin' in my room,"" sound ridiculous coming from the mouth of a 40 year-old man. Is this how he talks to his shrink? These muscle car confessionals and jerky, rough-edged transitions sounded not so much like metal, but Bruckheimer emo. Like Tim Kinsella, Hetfield found word pleasure in nursery puns such as ""purify/pure if I"" and ""ominous/I'm in us."" When ""Frantic"" cut from the grunting, ""My lifestyle determines my deathstyle"" refrain and shifted into the cooed ""keep on searching"" breakdown, it smelled strongly of sloppy pseudo-virtuoso bands like The Jazz June or Spitalfield. Emo bands found the simple process of merely moving from quiet to loud to be breathtaking. They wrote songs where beauty and melody was assumed on the count of clean guitar and picking chords, despite the fact that the two guitars had no knowledge of each other. In Metallica's case, the result was somehow worse for sounding so calculated and plotted in ProTools. ProTools had never been metal. ProTools never snorted ants up his FireWire from the side of the pool while urinating down a woman's dress. ProTools never inserted the sound of a chainsaw into the opening of ""Black Metal"" off the album Black Metal. ProTools never burned churches in Norway. And yet, ProTools had a major hand in assembling both ""American Life"" and ""Frantic"". The disc ended as the sun was rising over Syria. Had it lasted that long? My comrades and I looked at each other, stupefied. Our only memory was of forced effects, laughable lyrics, and audio surgical scars. I sat up and began packing my duffel. I'd rather pick bananas. One comrade suggested smuggling the disc out of the kibbutz to leak to the Internet. If Metallica were such proud artists behind their music, unable to both allow downloading and refund money after purchase, then we should warn others. Metallica had become less a band leading a genre than a team soaking up payroll in a second-tier sport. This was NASCAR, WWE. Logos, sneers, mustaches, and beards. Hair grows back, but the Jheri Curl of insincerity, of contradiction, and of compromising a cause never straightens.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5250-st-anger/,Elektra,2003.0
440,Led Zeppelin,How the West Was Won,Rock,8.8,June 11 2003,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"It means something when a rock and roll band is described with such passionately divisive rhetoric as Led Zeppelin. The band was a big, dumb example of every opulent shark-story rock clichÃ© of the 1970s: They were heavy-handed, irresponsible purveyors of the ""blues""; they were fake hippies and fake mystics who managed to strip even the grandest statements in rock of their power via mind-numbing drum solos and bowed-guitar expositions; they were the original Spinal Tap, replete with whole songs about Greek myths, ancient Celtic rituals, completely inappropriate bits of Bach spliced into Page's ""Heartbreaker"" solo, and a manager who was at once imposing, apologetic and the butt of Bob Dylan's jokes. One more thing: They were the greatest rock band to ever set foot on a stage, so what they fuck are you talking about? As they often do, things started small for this band of castaways and unknowns: Session guitarist Jimmy Page found himself thrown under the bus, holding the shitbag when The Yardbirds called it quits smack in the middle of a 1968 American tour. He was forced to piece together whatever ensemble he could to continue the tour, finding bassist and fellow session man John Paul Jones through a newspaper ad. Teen vocalist Robert Plant and his mate John Bonham were in Birmingham, discovered by Page on a talent-hunting expedition. The band were a rag-tag bunch, who were, if anything, most certainly not The Yardbirds. Nevertheless, after a few successful shows in the UK, they went to America, billed as ""Supporting Act"" in a another Spinal Tap twist of fate. By the end of their tour, they were headlining, and the rest is history. Right? Well, it's tricky. Led Zeppelin, authors of the most-played-song-in-radio-history and so many hallowed riffs and sexual double-entendres involving fruit, are so played-out at this point that they've managed to become taken for granted. Nobody blinks an eye when ""Rock and Roll"" shows up in a car commercial, because the band's music has long since become a pop-culture building block. Most of their big tunes are recognizable to the point of losing their emotional impact-- think, haven't you heard enough of ""Whole Lotta Love"", ""Black Dog"" and ""Kashmir""? And I might give a month off the end of my life to be spared from ever crossing paths with ""Stairway to Heaven"" again. Sure, Zep is great, but their classic-rock staples have been burnt into our minds-- each song exactly the same every time we hear it-- as unchanging musical patterns, and made predictable by force of infinite repetition. By now I'd think I'd have gleaned about as much pleasure from their music as I possibly could. Still, one thing that always strikes me about all of their music-- particularly their first five or six records-- is how effortless they made it all seem. Classic riffs seem like grade school basics now, but Page actually had to come up with all that stuff. And if you listen really close, those guys were doing more than just banging out the blues-- they brought out the best of a British take on rock, via funky, surprisingly accomplished arrangements and song forms, and a very potent eclecticism rarely found in bands that cracked the mainstream (much less reigned over it). And yet, none of those credentials really make me want to hear ""The Battle of Evermore"" again. So what's next? Jimmy Page found the two 1972 Los Angeles shows featured on the triple disc How the West Was Won while poring over his archives for what was to be a straight DVD release. And just like that, new magic is cast, new legends are born. One of the interesting things about Zep (and if you believe the rockists, this holds true for any truly ""great"" band) is that they made their most definitive statements in concert. The shows on this set document a band who were able to wring squeals, clangs and beats out of material that had been well considered and digested a million times over by performers and audience alike. Yes, they stretch out, often to near excruciatingly immense duration, but they also emphasize their greatest talents. Chiefly, How the West Was Won serves up the band's muscle, sweaty heart and golden grandeur in an exhaustingly persuasive light. That, and a hundred of the best riffs you've ever heard. Disc 1 keeps the exploratory blues odysseys to a minimum, though hardly at the expense of the epic saga that was their live power. In fact, from the furious, breakneck take of ""Immigrant Song"" to the almost otherworldly, ethereal ""Going to California"", it's one of the best sets of live music I've ever heard on CD. The band rips through most of the harder numbers a few notches faster than the album versions, and in the process, staves off most of the over-familiarity prone to live records. ""Black Dog"" gets a speed metal intro. ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" is transformed from its classic boogie-rock into an altogether rougher, funky jab. ""That's the Way"" (possibly the only Zep tune still underrated) and ""Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp"" form an acoustic mini-set with ""Going to California"" that yet again shows these guys were a lot more than barrelhouse blues riffs and high-heeled groupies in the hallway. And then there's ""Stairway"". It would take a lot to make this one fresh again, but I'll say that their slightly thrashy run-through at the end (with Jones on... piano?) and a few new guitar tricks during the intro do small wonders. Things take a turn for the far-out on Disc 2, beginning with the in-out-back-in-again-hold-up-we're-out-now version of ""Dazed and Confused"". The band takes its time easing into the tune, with a spooky bass- and drum-led funeral procession intro, but soon enough finds the jam. The song's infamous mid-section freakout gets everything it could have possibly had coming to it, including unexpected lapses into ""The Crunge"" and ""Walter's Walk"", in addition to giving Page his solo space and then some. 25 (!!) minutes later, they find the road again, somehow all ending up in the same place. Perhaps to recover, they follow with brisk versions of ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" (sounding now like a brutal piece of blue funk rather than its more famous loungy rock version) and the then-unreleased ""Dancing Days"". And then, the monster: almost 20 minutes of pounding, snapping and crashing on ""Moby Dick"", courtesy of the rock-solid, gorilla-footed Bonzo, probably fresh from having a Roadster delivered to his hotel that morning. Truth be told, if you had to take a snack break about ten minutes in, I wouldn't blame you. ""Whole Lotta Love"" gets the epic expansion on Disc 3, including a medley of no less than four complete versions of old rock and roll tunes inserted smack in the middle. But before that happens, they pull out all the spacy effects available to the super-wealthy in 1972, and don't forget to liven them up with a little skank-beat (who knew Zep could play ska?). Despite the detour, ""Rock and Roll"" doesn't sound tired for it-- and it shouldn't, as Page took the best performances from two shows to concoct the three-disc ""concert."" And finally, the set ends in authentic 70s roots style with a cover of Willie Dixon's ""Bring It on Home"", beginning with an understated harmonica-led intro before ramming it all back down with the sick-ass beats and engulfing bass rumble that had defined the previous couple of hours. Is this really the blues? Is this Blues Hammer? Nothing like it, I'm afraid-- it's Led Zeppelin, and for better (yay) or worse (nay), they only knew how to hit their own thing. I'm not one for reminiscing the classics, and in fact, I'm pretty sick of hearing about how great everything was supposed to be all those years ago (whatever years you happen to be talking about). That said, Page and company have done a nice job making me believe I've missed out on something special even when I thought I knew all this stuff backwards and forwards. Far from just a fan relic, much of How the West Was Won seems definitive, and maybe that explains why it happens to be the biggest selling record in the country at the time of this writing. Maybe there are bands tearing shit up like this now, I can't really be sure, but of this I am: Zep ruled, check it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4707-how-the-west-was-won/,Atlantic,2003.0
441,Devendra Banhart,The Black Babies EP,Folk/Country,7.7,June 9 2003,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"It's the middle of the night. You're sound asleep. Suddenly, the phone rings and all the sweet, sweet serotonin gets sucked straight from your brain in a mere instant. So now you're awake, but you're too tired to get up and answer the phone. The machine picks up, and someone on the other end starts plucking a guitar and singing in a vaguely creepy, almost gender neutral tenor. It's bone-chilling in the darkness. When it's over you struggle back into fitful, paranoid sleep, and in the morning when you wake up, the message is there. After several listens, you still don't know who it is, but the song is starting to make sense. It's actually pretty good. Devendra Banhart's music ingratiates itself to you like this. His simple songs-- typically two, maybe three chords, one acoustic guitar, and his shaky, freakish vocals layered on top-- have an archaic, almost primitive feel to them that's utterly otherwordly, and yet strangely, deeply American. Harry Smith would have heard treasure here, and Banhart's output shares a lot of ground with the Smithsonian Anthology of American Folk Music's creakiest selections. Plus, it sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine, engulfed in hiss and night sounds. That's somewhat by design, of course, at least as far as the actual releases of this mini-album (eight songs in 23 minutes) and his first full-length (2002's Oh Me Oh My) are concerned. Young God Records honcho and erstwhile Swan/meanwhile Angel of Light Michael Gira first heard Banhart via a rough demo that came in the mail and couldn't bring himself to have the kid come into the studio to polish the songs up. He felt that they sounded pretty well perfect as they were, and he was right-- it's hard to imagine these songs presented with any amount of gloss. The story goes that young Devendra was always recording these songs for himself on cheap recording devices and had to be convinced by friends and family to send them around to labels. The result is an uncanny honesty and open imperfection to the songs that would be impossible to capture in a studio. ""Cosmos and Delos"" is ink black and spare, with skeletal guitar figures and what sounds like a distant gunshot and street noise in the background. Banhart sings with himself in extremely close harmony, creating melody out of a near-drone. Banhart proves himself an able guitarist on ""Lagoon"", filling in the melodic gaps with gorgeous, cascading lines. The lyrics are almost inscrutably obtuse, with strange non-sequiturs like ""Never been to Minnesota/ Still I'd love to live in Maine/ Never been to Salamanca/ Still I'd love to live in Spain"". ""The Charles C. Leary"" is my favorite lyrically, detailing a series of surreal, dreamlike vignettes of a possible shipwreck. ""I lost the gloves my mother gave me/ While on the way to the make believe sea,"" he intones over a bobbing guitar part-- the song throbs and sways with seasickness, speeding up and slowing down as befits the urgency of each respective verse. Though it can be thoroughly engrossing, it bears noting that Banhart's music is decidedly not for everyone. If the sounds of the backwoods-- real or imagined-- appeal to you, Banhart will give you chills in the best way possible; if you're more into polish and can't stomach the deeply surreal, caution is definitely in your best interest. Still, Banhart is a singular talent, and if he hits you right, you'll be only too happy to be held in his thrall.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/547-the-black-babies-ep/,Young God,2003.0
442,The Black Keys,Thickfreakness,Rock,7.7,April 22 2003,Eric Carr,Contributor,"The pressure to make a White Stripes comparison here is almost unbearable, so I'll get this out of the way quick-like: The Black Keys and the Stripes will inevitably be indexed on the same page in the great canon of Rock history, but paper similarities aside-- each duo brazenly, turbulently rehashing American blues tradition through a minimalist storm of scraping guitars and bruised skins-- they've got almost nothing in common. The Black Keys may just be a couple of white dudes from Akron, but they seem closer in spirit to something that Muddy Waters himself might've considered ""the blues"" than to any midwestern bar-band's approximation of it. The only Stripes link of any importance, in fact, is that the Keys' previous album was better, too. Last year's The Big Come-Up introduced the garage-grime and ""white Hendrix"" croon of The Sonics to the unholy strut of Junior Kimbrough's legendary guitar lines, fusing them into a spitting, spewing, 40-ton monster. Winners like ""Heavy Soul"" evoked the primal ballet of Fordzilla crushing unmanned Buicks, and when it wasn't busy flattening rides, still offered a glimpse of the delicate machinery under the hood with soul cuts like ""I'll Be Your Man"". With Thickfreakness, the once-massive guitar is exponentially weightier, thicker, and juicier, swelling to Earth-shaking proportions, at the unfortunate loss of a little subtlety. But that's just the way it is sometimes; there's no room for luxuries like nuanced variations in tone, or shifting rhythms when you're fleeing from a fire-breathing behemoth. Still, swallow enough white-hot blues riffs and you get heartburn; it's hard not to miss Come-Up's pace-breaking exercises like ""Countdown"" or ""Them Eyes"" after blues explosion #348 (and counting). Even at its most delicate, Dan Auerbach's fretwork still hits like a hollowbody that's been filled with cement, and Patrick Carney's swaying grooves seem suppressed, driven further back in the mix. Once again, the Keys stomp as violently and elementally as before, but they nearly get carried away. Tracks like ""If You See Me"" and ""Hurt Like Mine"" attempt to reduce Thickfreakness' wildfire to merely a controlled burn, but even when the Keys try to play it cool on this album, they still run hot. Nothing strays too far from the molten desperation of a more typical offering of ""Midnight"" or an uber-faithful cover of The Sonics' ""Have Love Will Travel"". Ah, but who'm I kidding? Thickfreakness may veer towards oppressively monolithic, but it's also equal parts sincerity and devotion, thunder and lightning, majesty and naked anger. Look upon the power of the title track, mortals, and despair! The central riff splits heaven and earth, and for a few brief minutes, commands all your attention as you fear for your very life; it's an exorcism, a catharsis. And it only gets thicker and freakier from there, lurching into the cautionary force of the too-similar ""Hard Row""; like a simplified, but equally relentless version of its predecessor, the simple bluster is momentarily awe-inspiring. When Auerbach howls, ""It's a hard row to hoe by yourself,"" the release is overwhelming. But sure enough, the intensity of the opening combination proves impossible to maintain for long. Though the stutter-stepping percussion and racing, rise/fall soloing of ""Set You Free"" nearly succeeds at preserving the pummeling drive beyond all limits of human endurance, it ends up being the most purely entertaining cut on the album simply out of the necessity for respite. The body braces itself for another towering blast after being further skewered by Auerbach's nasty hooks in the opening seconds, and gets (only a little) less than that, but the relaxation is welcome. From that point on, Thickfreakness begins to run together slightly, though as mentioned earlier, not for lack of energy. The related concerns of a need for a bit more understatement and variety hinder the Black Keys this time around, but remain somewhat insignificant in relation to their even-more-muscular blues attack. On top of that, the ultra-minimal echoes of ""Cry Alone"" and the R.L. Burnside-as-channeled-thru-MC5 tangle of ""Hold Me in Your Arms"" partially ameliorates the somewhat pervasive sameness, closing the album with a distinctly different sound than they've yet shown. All told, the shortcomings are relative to what the duo already proved themselves capable of on The Big Come-Up; Thickfreakness isn't quite their debut, but it's still a powerhouse, even exceeding its ancestor in total spectacle. Raw rock grandeur as so frequently conjured up on this album is hard to come by in any capacity; if that means having to overlook a few minor flaws, it's worth it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/766-thickfreakness/,Fat Possum,2003.0
443,Gorillaz,Phase One: Celebrity Take Down,"Electronic,Rock",5.6,February 4 2003,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"Okay, so interactivity ain't all it's cracked up to be. Here I was, all excited to take my reviewing skills into THE THIRD DIMENSION. But rather than getting the musical equivalent of a novel, I was about to dig into a Choose Your Own Adventure, baby, controlling my destiny like a true red-blooded American. If there's any musical entity fitting for this open-ended treatment, it's Gorillaz, an act that doesn't physically exist beyond binary code. Nominally some kind of oblique statement about the artificiality of today's pop stars, there were about a million ways this cartoon group could've been Jem 2000, quickly filed in the novelty-music dustbin of history. But saved by an actually pretty decent album of spooky, vaguely hip-hop-flavored solo material from Blur's Damon Albarn and a gaggle of other hipsters and bold-edged lewd anime from Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, Gorillaz beat out many flesh groups to become the rare act with success on both sides of the Atlantic. Chalk up a big chunk of that success to the video for ""Clint Eastwood"", a Leone-inspired (Sergio, not Dominique) video featuring, amongst other things, a gigantic static ghost voiced by Del tha Funkee Homosapien and zombie monkeys recreating the choreography from Thriller. Like a rebel yell, it made me want more, more, more, and so the idea of a Gorillaz video collection was quite delectable. That's basically what Phase One: Celebrity Take Down is, as it collects ""Clint Eastwood"" and the band's four other videos, with a whole bunch of extra stuff (some interesting, some useless) thrown in for padding. All of this material is arranged into an environment very similar to the renowned Gorillaz website, with all the features spread out over the band members' rooms and other nooks and crannies of their house. This arrangement allows Hewlett to cram the DVD full of interesting clutter and detail, as well as some nifty 3-D CGI, but also makes it practically impossible to get to what you want to see quickly-- no labels anywhere, unless there's a booklet not included in my promo copy's slipcase that helps point the viewer towards his goal. The fancy interface can't cover up a dearth of material, however; there's not much beyond the videos, and the ones that aren't ""Clint Eastwood"" are only marginally more interesting than screensavers, the bizarre Road Rally of ""19-2000"" excepted. For the 2% of the world that cares, they also include extensive kinematics and sketches for all the videos, so you can enjoy the animation in stationary, pencil form. Visuals from the Gorillaz live show are also provided, using even more recycled footage than the videos, and there are two award show performances where one can use the angle button to view different computer animations created for the event. This feat of technology is easily overshadowed by the guest rappers filling for Del on the Chinese award show performance of ""Clint Eastwood"", two earnest fellas that nonetheless prove that the Mandarin incarnation of The Streets is gonna be a whole lot harder to swallow. Further strewn about are a few thirty-second clips featuring the band members (Gorilla Bites), segments which prove that 1) the group possesses a very distinctively British wit (one clip revolves around how to kill an eel for culinary purposes), and 2) a lot more could have been done to add depth to these drawerings. The message I took away from the DVD is that, surprisingly, the conceptual part of Gorillaz lags far behind the music; despite all the detail, there's not much character to the characters (they're even outperformed by Hewlett and Albarn's Cuckoo's Nest impressions in the mockumentary Charts of Darkness). The Gorillaz's feature film currently in the works might remedy this failing (and just might be the best movie featuring fictional musicians since Glitter), but in terms of this release, the wasted potential of the gimmick and relative weakness of the features makes it little more than a take-home version of the website for the DSL-impaired.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3525-phase-one-celebrity-take-down/,Virgin,2002.0
444,The Roots,Phrenology,Rap,8.1,January 28 2003,Sam Chennault,,"When they first stepped out in the mid-90s, The Roots were regarded by many as an interesting but quaint novelty act. Although other hip-hop groups had used live instrumentation, The Roots were the first well-publicized, full-fledged hip-hop band, thus providing fans with a comeback when our culturally obtuse friends or relatives would say ""rap isn't music."" The Roots were also one of the first acts to speak out against the hip-hop tendency toward hyper-capitalism, a criticism which reached its zenith in the hilarious video for ""What They Do"". But, to paraphrase Biggie, things done changed in the hip-hop game. Now live musical accompaniment is becoming increasingly prevalent-- The Neptunes donned a backing band for NER*D-- and while political consciousness is still an important component of hip-hop, it's hardly unique, and no longer en vogue in an increasingly conservative cultural climate. So what are the pioneers to do when they find that their style has been played to the extreme by half-assed imitators? What any true artists would: Submerge themselves in the lab for three years and come out with a new, airtight sound, awash with challenging-- but not too challenging-- deviations from their formula. For Phrenology, The Roots supplement their trademark loose and light jazz palate with harder, more aggressive tones, eschewing their ""organic"" sound and using the studio as an instrument. On ""Rock You"", The Roots open with a snarl, as a jagged and spare arrangement backs Black Thought's aggressive flow. As with many songs on Phrenology, ""Rock You"" is accented by decidedly inorganic electro flourishes, with a noticeable absence of the smooth jazz keys that made hippie hip-hop headz cream their collective jeans back in the mid-to-late-90s. Unfortunately, the track contains album's weakest hook, with Black Thought screaming, ""We will rock you/ Rock You!/ ROCK YOU!"" Which is exactly what they do on the acerbic, 24-second Bad Brains knock-off ""!!!!!!"", a straight-up, raw-as-fuck punk track which I respect for its sheer boldness, even if that it had me covering my ears. In sharp contrast, ""Water"" clocks in at well over ten minutes, and is perhaps the first clear cut example of mainstream prog-hop. For hip-hop purists, it's easy to dismiss this song-- which deals with former band member Malik B's struggle with addiction-- as needlessly bloated, but given its personal subject matter, it's understandable why ?uest and crew indulged themselves in a dark, expressionistic foray into the mindset of a drug addict. We can only hope that Malik gets the message. But despite these two extremes, Phrenology can't be boiled down simply to superfluous experimentalism or a complete abjuration of their previous work. It manages to incorporate all the elements that have characterized The Roots' sound; they revisit the old-skool hip-hop template on the ""apache""-laced ""Thought @ Work"", where Black Thought approximates the rapid-fire cadence of Kool G. Rap (one of many examples on Phrenology that have Thought switching up his flow to compensate for the loss of Malik B). For ""WAOK (Ay) Rollcall"", The Roots once again enlist Ursula Rucker to give a brief spoken word piece, in which she namechecks the architects of hip-hop culture. However, there's also the overtly political number, ""Pussy Galore"", which may be one of the most vapid, boring examples of political consciousness ever recorded by a major hip-hop group, and the weakest spot on the album by a long shot. Hopefully, it won't become another source of ammunition in Coca-Cola's campaign to represent/co-opt ""real"" hip-hop. Structurally, there's the now-expected spoken word bit at the end (this time performed by the esteemed and controversial poet Amiri Baraka), and a hidden track featuring Talib Kweli. It's preceded by two red herrings, twenty-second-long tracks of silence, and followed by a brief techno burn that's sure to have fans scratching their heads. Like ""What They Do"" from Illadelph Halflife and ""You Got Me"" from Things Fall Apart, the current single, ""Break You Off"", is an obligatory three-word R&B; crossover number, replete with guest vocalist Musiq's nu-soul crooning, four cellists, a noir concept video, and a $300,000 budget. Despite the obvious radio pandering, it's a beautifully smooth and melodic song, featuring some of their warmest production ever. To The Roots' credit, they utilize their guest appearances better than on any of their other previous efforts. ""Seed (2.0)"", a cover of a track from L.A. crooner Cody Chesnutt's recent Headphone Masterpiece, is the most immediately satisfying track on the album-- which is surprising, since it's an orgiastic garage funk number with a blazing guitar riff that feels lifted from Sticky Fingers-era Stones. Regardless of how you feel about The Roots' aesthetic-- I tend to gravitate toward the traditional two turntables and a microphone hip-hop paradigm-- you have to give these guys credit for making an album that so successfully combines ambition and experimentation with accessibility. Phrenology completely realizes The Roots' talents and potential, maintaining its cohesiveness despite its many disparate elements. It's a stark rebuke to those who say hip-hop artists can't turn out solid full-lengths: For its few negligible missteps, Phrenology has more than enough momentum to sustain an uninterrupted listen.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6832-phrenology/,"MCA,Okayplayer",2002.0
445,Nas,God's Son,Rap,8.6,January 13 2003,Sam Chennault,,"Unlike other MCs who rose to prominence in the early 90s, Nasir Jones (aka Nas) had the artistic misfortune to survive that decade. It may be a grotesque thing to say, but if Nas had fallen after releasing a slew of classic singles and his startling debut Illmatic, he'd be every bit as revered as Biggie, 2Pac, Big Pun and Big L. Instead, Nas has broken our hearts with a series of decent-to-mediocre albums that belittle both his considerable talent and the sheer brilliance of Illmatic. Between 1996 and late 2001, Nas morphed into a studio gangsta, and seemingly turned his back on the audience that initially supported him. When his now-infamous feud with Jay-Z began, Nas was nursing a faltering career and had virtually no street cred; he found himself at the mercy of an adversary with half his talent but twice his hunger. But rather than submit to a Jay-Z deathblow, Nas stepped back to the mic and began to revisit the lyrical mastery that characterized his early work. If his rivalry with Jay fueled a partial comeback on Stillmatic, God's Son amasses him even more tumultuous ammunition. Not a bad recovery for a year and a half's work. Nas has been marginalized by the hip-hop community (or has marginalized himself, depending on which magazines you buy), endured the revelation that his child's mother had an affair with Jay-Z, and most tragically, dealt with the loss of his own mother. The shadows of these ghosts can be found throughout God's Son: he mentions the affair in no less than three songs, and on the ""Last Real Nigger Alive"", details his various beefs with Wu-Tang, Biggie, and Jay. If nothing else, the track is a revealing, semi-objective look at the long-rumored beef between the Wu's Raekwon, Nas, and Biggie, which, according to Nas, involved Raekwon and Biggie stealing his slang. Nas ends the song with one last diss for Jay-Z, ""The Gift and Curse? Fuck that shit! The first shall be last... I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo."" Damn... The beauty of this album, of course, lies not in gossip, but in the emotional range and lyrical complexity Nas injects. While he does give nods to the street on the grimy ""Get Down"", reminiscent of Illmatic's ""New York State of Mind"", Nas also acknowledges that life isn't as straightforward as it once was; on the Eminem-produced ""The Cross"", Nas references his mother's death, then raps, ""And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck/ A six, a truck, some guns to bust/ I wish it was that simple."" The pain of loss saturates the album, manifesting in various spots as a source of strength, sorrow, and regret. It makes its presence known on the excellent ""Warrior Song"": ""Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket/ Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have, kid/ I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral?/ Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real/ Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still."" The self-examination that inevitably accompanies the death of a loved one has also provoked a renewed sense of socio-political consciousness in Nas. While he's always acknowledged that there's more to life than bustin' caps and smokin' blunts, Nas pushes these themes to the forefront on much of God's Son. ""I Can"" may be one of his most commercially viable tracks to date; it jacks its melody from Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"", features a children's choir on its chorus, and in the first two verses, warns of drug abuse and the sexual exploitation of minors. It's a nice enough sentiment, but it's also one we've been inundated with ad nauseam since first grade. Still, as you're about to skip forward to the next track, Nas drops his finest example of radical black politics yet. The verse bears repeating in full: ""Before we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
It was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books,
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed.
Money then became empowerment for Europeans,
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings
and everything sacred.
Africa was almost robbed naked.
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went.
He wasn't shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control."" In many ways, God's Son is lyrically superior to Illmatic. Nas has created an album that is at once mournful and resilient, street-savvy and academic. As an MC, he's technically stunning. His arsenal of flows would make even Jay jealous (and likely does after ""Guns N' Roses""), and manages to be both rhythmically versatile and intellectually astute. Illmatic was an incredibly sick album-- one of the sickest ever-- and its influence still hangs over rap, but God's Son may ultimately have more emotional depth, something far too few critics give hip-hop credit for. This is the kind of album I'd have hoped that Biggie, Pac or Big L would've written had they survived. What separates Illmatic from God's Son, though, and what ultimately robs this album of a 10.0, is the lukewarm production, some throwaway lines, and a slew of disposable hooks. The musical mediocrity of ""Mastermind"" and the commercial disposability of ""Hey Nas"" could be overlooked but for the sheer garbled trash of ""Zone Out"", which kicks the rating down at least a full point. Still, in this Age of the Producer, when most critics privilege form over content, regarding vocals as little more than musical instruments and preferring the safety of nonsensical lyrics, it's important that we remember the role of the MC in hip-hop, that of the innercity griot who captures all the stories, struggles, and secret language that slip through the media's cracks; the seer, who with one ear to the pavement and the other on his heart provokes and inspires. On God's Son, Nas does all these things, effectively taking a bat to his ""one hot album every ten year average.""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5710-gods-son/,"Columbia,Ill Will",2002.0
446,Pearl Jam,Riot Act,Rock,4.9,January 5 2003,Kyle Reiter,,"Every few years or so, as Pearl Jam prepare for the grand unveiling of their latest opus, everyone gets re-inundated with PR promises of the old grunge gods breaking free from their self-imposed confines for a grand ""return to form,"" and told that, ""No, really, this time they've proven themselves as something more than a just the band that launched a thousand Candleboxes."" Yet, while Pearl Jam have outlasted virtually all of their grunge contemporaries, they've hardly ever strayed from the classicist approach that brought them into the rock world back in '91. Riot Act, their seventh and most recent album, perpetuates the notion that Pearl Jam is a tremendous rock band, despite their catalog's evidence to the contrary. Like communism, Pearl Jam is as good as it gets in theory, but it never quite seems to work out in practice: They're a hard working and talented group who use their fame to champion causes that are dear to them-- even when that means alienating fans and fighting unwinnable wars against corporate giants-- and they take full advantage of their major label status (and dollars) by circumventing traditional ways of thinking about the band/fan relationship. Through fan-club-only Christmas seven-inches and that entire tour's worth of live releases, Pearl Jam have attempted to prove that recording for the majors doesn't have to be synonymous with MTV pandering. If only their music brimmed with the creativity of their business practices. Since 1998's Yield, Pearl Jam have relied on an unchanging musical formula, consistently declining the opportunity to innovate or improve their sound, even while hinting that they could if they could be assured it wouldn't completely tank. Since the genre-defining Ten, the band has given us occasional glimpses at something more unique-- most notably on Vitalogy, a wonderful, reactionary mess of an album, and then with the diverse No Code, and even Yield's Eastern-tinged bonus track-- but mostly, they've settled for traditional rock riffs and general coasting. Riot Act sadly exemplifies this, bringing them ever closer to homogenous bar-band territory. The record peaks early on the opener ""Can't Keep"", a three-guitar gallop that immediately strikes as fresh in contrast to the band's other recent work. Eddie Vedder seldom pens a melody this original, and the song's gloomy, atmospheric production compensates for the bored musicianship. From there, however, Riot Act meanders from one song to the next with an overwhelming insipidness. The devastated lyrics of ""Love Boat Captain"", which mourns the tragic deaths of nine fans at the June 2000 Roskilde Festival, are affecting, but the song itself is a standard rocker, which seems an odd choice to accompany Vedder's poetic remorse. Riot Act does momentarily pick up as it nears its end. ""Greendisease"" is the closest to new wave Pearl Jam has ever come, and the Jeff Ament-penned ""Help Help"" passes on the simple fact that it sounds at least somewhat different from the band's archetypal rock'n'roll sound, and breaks the monotony of an otherwise barren collection of songs. Of course, what'll likely stick with you after the disc stops spinning is the unbearable lows. The mechanical, pulsating guitar arpeggios of ""You Are"" almost seem to cop from Trans-era Neil Young until you realize that it'd set a nice ambiance for a semi-truck barreling down a highway in Stallone's Over the Top. Worse still is ""Bushleaguer"", a near-rap about D.C.'s current policy makers. Vedder's intentions here are admirable, but it's difficult to imagine the execution failing any more miserably. His delivery is painfully snide, served up with snotty, ain't-I-witty attitude, and the lyrics, which clearly aim for a grittier mentality than typical Pearl Jam fare (""Swingin' for the fence/ Got lucky with a strike/ Drilling for fear makes the job simple/ Born on third, thinks he got a triple"") come off more Springsteen than Fugazi. Everywhere else on Riot Act, Pearl Jam sound like they're supposed to, with their usual distortion-powered riffs and stadium drums banging alongside Vedder's emotionally damaged mumbling. And though it's hard, even now, not to root for them, this album has sadly not upped their relistenability.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6206-riot-act/,Epic,2002.0
447,Audioslave,Audioslave,Rock,1.7,November 25 2002,Chris Dahlen & Ryan Schreiber,,"Us Generation X'ers never gave the world shit. We don't care about anything. We don't even care about ourselves. We blew through our dotcom cash and we're still stuck with our student loans. Our biggest political moment was turning Ralph Nader into a presidential spoiler. And now, justice comes swiftly knocking. It is time to face that which we fear the most: the second coming of Lollapalooza's grunge-rock all-stars. Recent days have seen the re-emergence of an eerie number of megacelebrity has-beens-- from Jane's Addiction backing Courtney Love on tour, to Krist Novoselic joining forces with Meat Puppeteer Curt Kirkwood in Eyes Adrift-- combining their powers in the hopes of forming one mightier superbeast. And yea, we have seen these bands and known our sins, and the discipline was just and fair. But repent we did not. And so, as further castigation, we now find ourselves faced with the ultimate grievance: Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell assuming vocal duties for Urban Outfitters politicos Rage Against the Machine. Let the punishment fit the crime. The story goes that sometime after Zach de la Rocha dropped out of Rage, Cornell agreed to be the new singer, so long as they ditched their political bent and changed their name. And based on the evidence, losing the politics doesn't hurt the music: as Cornell proves here time and again, he can still voraciously belt the most inane lyrical tragedies with such conviction that you'd almost think they meant something were it not for such giveaways as, ""Pearls and swine bereft of me,"" and, ""Heaven waits for those who run/ Down your winter and underneath your waves/ Where you watch and wait."" It's also amusing to note that after years of playing the hardcore leftist, overeducated liberator of jailed antiheroes, Tom Morello gladly dropped the message from his music in lieu of playing venues that don't hang their name on a Schlitz sign. Bassist Tom Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk fall in line, but it's Cornell that's made a bitch out of all of them-- from forcing them to cancel a slot on the Ozzfest bill, to sticking them with the most asinine bandname of the year. (It was Cornell's idea to dub this bloated masturbathon Audioslave, and the name says everything with the same exacting precision that it says nothing at all. Audioslave. It's like it was tailor-made for a Sam Goody voiceover.) It's kind of incredible how slick and lifeless the Rage band sounds without de la Rocha spitting all over everything. The guys just autopilot their way through the most generic hard rock possible behind Cornell's Dio-like wailing about highways and death and more highways. Morello tries to stick out with his wanky solos, but all his effort amounts to little more than an indulgent novelty. He, of course, is less an embarrassment than Cornell. Now, I'll freely admit being a Soundgarden fan: I remember when all the guys admired his politically correct take on machismo, and all the girls swooned at his hairy good looks and dreamed of just ripping the flannel right off him. To be fair, his voice sounds great, even after years of larynx-shredding throat-gore. The effect, unfortunately, is lost when you realize that all the lyrics are complete gibberish. ""Set if off/ Set it off, my children."" ""I will wait for you/ Like a stone/ I will wait for you there/ Alone."" Or best of all: ""I am a virus!"" He also rips off some pseudo-spiritual lyrics from the latest Christian grunge bands, which is ironic because... well, you know the drill: the student becomes the teacher, and they all ride the short bus together. Sure, the pulsing noises and rumbling groan that open ""Set It Off"" sound wicked, and ""Bring 'Em Back Alive"" and ""Getaway Car"" almost don't suck. You could even say that, technically, Audioslave ""rock"". But they do so emptily, predictably, and without a single new idea. Producer Rick Rubin has fashioned a synthesized rock-like product that emits no heat. It's the worst kind of studio rock album, rigorously controlled-- even undercut-- by studio gimmickry; the rare instances during which the band starts to let go (the end of ""Shadow on the Sun"") are incidental and abruptly cut off. At its worst, this project is just plain retarded. On ""Show Me How to Live"", Audioslave snatch the opening chords from Simple Minds' ""Don't You (Forget About Me)""-- try keeping the ""hey hey hey hey"" out of your head during this thing-- and then cop the riff from Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way"". Top this hall-of-fame moment of classic un-inspiration with a bridge that consists solely of heavily processed violin, and the fact that the song features Cornell yelling to his creator, ""You gave me life, now show me how to live!"" Was it too much to ask for some effort? Were we already pressing our luck that these guys even got together? And it's so frustrating because Cornell would be better suited to virtually anything else. The man would sound more at home dueting with Shania. Listen to that! I'm in awe of his lungs. He belts these songs like they never went out of style, like he's still got that curly Louder Than Love-era mane thrown back and glistening, like he wants to shake the studio to its very foundation with the power of all his gristled fury-- when all of a sudden, the effects kick in and morph his voice into a fucking sitar! It just might be the most ridiculous and ill-timed production trick of his career. And all I can picture is Cornell high-fiving Rick Rubin and hitting the beach to play volleyball with Creed. Duck, because America's gonna vomit.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/356-audioslave/,Epic,2002.0
448,Nirvana,Nirvana,Rock,7.0,November 14 2002,Will Bryant,,"It's been weird the last couple of months, driving around the plywood-lined canyons of Hollywood-- the endless construction zone, the castles of scaffolding and the drywall faÃ§ades that mark the parking garages, the Scientology test centers, the mini-malls of tomorrow. Between rows of handbills for 8 Mile and Christina Aguilera's Stripped there are stark grids of them, white on black, with a single word: NIRVANA. And for a moment, it's as if nothing has changed in the ten years I've lived in Los Angeles. The payphones are still plastered with flyers beckoning models and movie extras, and you can still get a pretty decent slice of pie for six bucks. I'm still secretly infatuated with the oversized billboards that hawk made-for-cable movies down on the Sunset Strip, and I still think In 'n' Out Burgers are overrated. But somehow it's comforting to see the handbills-- ghostly, surreal tombstones, reverent in their simplicity. Had Kurt Cobain not shot himself in the face in April 1994, it's hard to say how different the world might be. The commercial explosion of alternative rock began with the four-chord blitzkrieg of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", decimating the glass ceiling that had taunted major-label hopefuls like R.E.M., The Flaming Lips, and The Pixies in the 80s. The majors responded by hiring battalions of silver-tongued A&R; reps to find a successor for the band, bloating their rosters with gimmicky wannabes and booking Butch Vig, Jack Endino, Steve Albini, Scott Litt and Brad Wood solid through 1998. While the feeding frenzy brought deserved attention to idiosyncratic bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam, it ended with the ""alternative"" tag being co-opted by any and every new band, and soon the uniformly aggressive sounds of Bush, Live, and Silverchair ruled the airwaves. Kurt Cobain did not live to see this. Nor did Cobain live to see the music-biz megamergers of the late 90s, which found a liquor empire acquiring venerable Hollywood labels like A&M;, Geffen, and DGC (Nirvana's label) and booting literally hundreds of bands-- including Cobain's beloved Raincoats and Meat Puppets-- from the majors. Surely Cobain would have reacted with abject disgust to the brazen payola which successfully poised Limp Bizkit as the new alt-rock prototype, or with disappointment as the old-school punk stylings of Green Day and The Offspring gave birth to the eerily homogenous, overcompressed frat-rock that currently dominates your friendly neighborhood Clear Channel or Infinity affiliate. Likewise, Pitchfork was not around in 1991 to guardedly praise the slick, but undeniably classic Nevermind, to shake our heads in bafflement at the curiosity shop of Incesticide, or to hold lighters aloft at the majestic bombast of In Utero. Had Kurt Cobain lived to mark the ten-year anniversary of his biggest success in September 2001, he would have gotten his Leonard Cohen afterworld, and if it wasn't his weekend to keep Frances Bean he probably would have written a song about it. Perhaps he'd have recognized the budding songwriting chops of bandmate Dave Grohl and begun a songwriting collaboration/competition worthy of Lennon and McCartney, or taken a couple of years off before emerging with a brilliant, basement-recorded solo album (and a beard). Instead, I find myself in the curious position of eulogizing Nirvana based on this fourteen-track best-of collection whose very existence is the result of a legal settlement. Exciting, huh? I think we can all agree that Sid & Nancy would've been a much more compelling story if, rather than Nancy Spungen dying in a Chelsea Hotel bathroom, she had survived Sid Vicious, kicked her habit, taken acting lessons, hired a phalanx of attorneys to force evil journalists and record companies to cease and desist their dastardly anti-Nancy conspiracies, and published Sid's private diaries for a $2 million payday. Long story short, Grohl and Krist Novoselic spent a year compiling an exhaustive box set with heaps of previously unreleased material, demo and rehearsal recordings, live gems, and the like; Courtney Love insisted on releasing this more conventional best-of first. On the one hand, this radio-friendly unit shifter is indeed an artful selection of the band's most seminal material-- four cuts each from Nevermind and In Utero, two from Incesticide and Unplugged in New York, and one from Bleach. Then, of course, there's the bait: the haunting, previously unreleased ""You Know You're Right"", recorded during Nirvana's last-ever studio session, and laced with tantalizingly literal expressions of the physical and mental pain that dominated the last months of Cobain's life. On the other hand, the very existence of Nirvana is a cynical assessment of the current retail climate-- a party mix for parents who want to appreciate Cobain's Lennon-esque knack for great melodies without having to click past ""Scentless Apprentice"" or ""Territorial Pissings"". With the possible exception of ""Rape Me"", Nirvana is utterly inoffensive: an impulse buy from Columbia House, perhaps, with no more artistic value than The Eagles' Greatest Hits or the Beatles' 1. If the kids want a righteous Nirvana mix, they'll burn one-- let the yuppies pad Frances Bean's college fund with their filthy dotcom lucre. Nirvana lies all of its cards on the table immediately with the familiar chugging rhythms of ""You Know You're Right"", Novoselic's bass menacing as Cobain rakes the strings above the bridge of his beloved Mustang for a dissonant, Thurston Moore-on-Zoloft effect. The song itself is something of a sketch: Kurt reportedly rewrote several lyrics just before the recording session and intentionally slurs where the words aren't quite there (er, ""Let's talk about someone else/ Steaming soup begins to melt""?). ""You Know You're Right"" predictably hits all the familiar Nirvana marks, and pointed lines like, ""I will move away from here,"" and, ""Nothing really bothers her/ She just wants to love herself,"" seem aimed directly at Love, hinting that ragged dissections of marital discord might have dominated Nirvana's fourth album. This is one of the most beguiling mysteries of Nirvana: how a thrift store-sweater-wearing kid from trailer-park Aberdeen went from the carefree jangle of ""About a Girl"" to the stormy malevolence of ""All Apologies"" (which pointedly rhymes ""married"" with ""buried""; Cobain would be both shortly after writing it). ""About a Girl"" feigns nonchalance, but there are omens beneath the surface that would haunt much of Cobain's short life-- the intrinsically unhealthy relationship that festers more out of apathy and convenience than genuine affection. ""I'll take advantage while you hang me out to dry,"" Cobain sings with matter-of-factness. In his liner notes for Nirvana, David Fricke notes that Cobain wrote ""About a Girl"" after an extended session listening to Meet the Beatles, and while the connection is not immediately apparent, the song does serve as a blueprint for some of Cobain's most tuneful later compositions. Built around a mostly two-chord groove, the song veers in unexpected directions for the power choruses, made all the more effective by Cobain's unique guitar tuning. It's curious, based on the clean guitars and tinny cymbals that dominate here, how Nirvana ever came to be identified with grunge, the genuinely dirty and moody sound more readily associated with contemporaries Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Tad than the punk-metal hybrid Nirvana favored. This is followed by Incesticide's two most accessible cuts. ""Been a Son"", from 1989's Blew EP, sounds like a test run for Nevermind, all rigid harmonies and tight, churning guitar (interestingly, the version here restores 30 seconds of music inexplicably cut from the Incesticide mix, including Novoselic's bass solo). ""Sliver"", one of the few Nirvana songs to directly address biographical details from Cobain's childhood, turns a simple visit to grandma's into a traumatic episode of parental abandonment, confusion, and fear. Next up are the quartet of selections from Nevermind, which rightfully explode from the mix just as ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""In Bloom"" seemed to slice through your Passat's shitty speakers on your way to high school. I still contend it's Grohl's punishing drum attack and not the famous four-chord riff that sells ""Teen Spirit"" (even Cobain admitted the song was a derivative pastiche of Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"" and The Pixies), though Andy Wallace's slick-as-Valvoline mix remains the gold standard of the soft verse/loud chorus dynamic. Likewise, ""Come as You Are"" gleans its hook directly from Novoselic's rubbery bassline slithering in and out of the mix with frightening stealth. But ""Lithium"" and ""In Bloom"" are wholly Cobain's, with references tailor-made for the American everyteen: ""Today I've found my friends/ They're in my head""; ""I'm so ugly, but that's okay 'cause so are you."" Both knowingly turn the enthusiastic ""yeah yeah yeah's"" of the Beatles into snarling expressions of sarcasm-- an allusion literalized in the ""In Bloom"" video, which pitched Nirvana as 60s idols with matching outfits on an Ed Sullivan-esque variety show (which in turn inspired the complete wardrobe of vintage Weezer). It's interesting how Nevermind, written and recorded well before the crest of sudden fame crushed Cobain's spirit, almost seems more jaded than its successor-- ""Teen Spirit"" and ""In Bloom"" deriding fans as mindless drones that demand entertainment, yet ""don't know what it means."" By contrast, In Utero, which begins with the words, ""Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I'm bored and old,"" and ends with an apology, is full of curiously thoughtful retractions and carefully worded sentiments. The provocatively titled ""Heart-Shaped Box"" and ""Rape Me"" represent Cobain's sympathy for, and fascination with, the female of the species. I've always considered ""Heart-Shaped Box"", with its elliptical guitar figure and explosive choruses, to be one of Cobain's most accomplished compositions. For all its heavy-handed symbolism, the song strikes deepest to Cobain's preoccupation with birth, the menstrual cycle, and female anatomy, wound tightly with primal tension in the verses and released with sublime catharsis in the choruses. But ""Rape Me""-- meant to be an anthem of empowerment from the perspective of the victim-- comes off as a shallow and transparent attempt to court controversy. The four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" riff (Nirvana would often tease live audiences with a few licks from ""Teen Spirit"" before launching into its intellectually stunted first cousin). The seemingly tacked-on bridge (""My favorite inside source/ I'll kiss your open sores"") is one of Cobain's most awkward, and I think most of us could have done without the distressed round-robin choruses of ""Rape me! Rape me!"" that close the song. ""Pennyroyal Tea"" is presented here in a ""previously unreleased"" alternate mix (actually, it's widely available on the 'clean' version of In Utero) that basically nudges the guitars and Cobain's harmony vocals up ever so slightly. The mix was prepared by Scott Litt for a single withdrawn after Cobain's suicide (the single included ""I Hate Myself and Want to Die"" as a b-side). Cobain's fascination with female bodily processes continues (pennyroyal tea was famously used to induce abortion in colonial America) as he enumerates remedies he's tried to relieve his own pain-- warm milk and laxatives, but not heroin. ""Dumb"" is one of Cobain's most underrated efforts, a populist revision of ""Lithium"" that replaces Nevermind's misanthropy with earnest self-deprecation. With a jaunty guitar hook that rivals ""Polly"" or ""About a Girl"", ""Dumb"" finds Cobain not sneering at his fans with distaste, but pining for the simple pleasures of wasting time and taking drugs (well, sniffing glue) with his friends. Kera Schaley's cello is ""Dumb""'s secret weapon, overshadowing Novoselic's simple bassline and lending the bridge (hands down, Cobain's best) a transcendent country-rock lilt: ""Skin the sun, fall asleep/ Wish away, the soul is cheap/ Lesson learned, wish me luck/ Soothe the burn, wake me up."" The emphatic harmonies in the final refrains (""I think I'm DUMB, I think I'm DUMB..."") are among Cobain's most vulnerable, successfully conveying a deep longing in a way that the overambitious ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""Rape Me"" miss completely. Nirvana closes with two cuts from Unplugged in New York: a low-key reading of In Utero's somber ""All Apologies"" and an inspired cover of David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"". Keen selections, but unfortunately the loss of fidelity between the crystalline studio recordings and a live performance that was only supposed to sound good on TV gives this collection a distinctly incomplete feeling. So do I give Nirvana a 10.0 for the unimpeachable quality of the material, or a 2.0 for the crass cynicism for which it's exploited? I mean, this collection is by no means essential-- Nevermind and In Utero are. I almost wish that the release of Nirvana had been postponed another year so that Courtney Love could have seen Matador's illuminating and respectful double-disc packaging of Pavement's Slanted & Enchanted, which offers the original album, an entire live show, two Peel sessions, three singles, and previously unreleased material-- all for the same suggested retail price as Nirvana. The packaging includes hand-scribbled pages from Stephen Malkmus' notebooks (but not his whole goddamn diary) and liner notes written by band members and people who were actually there-- not just some rockcrit eager to unpack his adjectives. It's probably the best reissue of any album I've ever seen, and not just because it's an indie rock classic, but because it's assembled with such selfless affection. By comparison, Nirvana feels like a rush job-- reverent to the memory of Kurt Cobain, but disrespectful, even patronizing, of his infinitely patient fans. It would have been fantastic, for instance, to finally hear the original Steve Albini mixes of ""All Apologies"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"", or favorites like ""Sappy"" (a huge radio hit here in southern California) and ""Spank Thru"" placed in the greater context of Nirvana's better-known repertoire. Dozens of illuminating b-sides and compilation tracks (everything from covers of the Velvet Underground and the Wipers to a full-band reading of Grohl's excellent ""Marigold"") are conspicuously absent here, doubtlessly because the publishing royalties don't go to Love. But at least the floodgates are open, with both a rarities collection, and yes, that box set finally in the pipeline. Since words are cheap, though (and Cobain's diaries are only $20.97 over at Amazon), I'll leave you with a quote from Cobain himself, quoted by Fricke in defense of this album's crassness: ""All the albums I ever liked were albums that delivered a great song, one after the other."" Hey, I like albums like that, too, Kurt. It's just that records like Nirvana, with its 24-bit remastering job to smooth the transitions between drummers and producers, deprive the listener of the very thing they should be generously supplying: context.

449,Johnny Cash,American IV: The Man Comes Around,Folk/Country,6.9,November 7 2002,Eric Carr,Contributor,"The Man in Black's vision of the American west is one of a rugged, mournful land, where outlaws carry bibles over their hearts, and where sometimes, the good book even stops a bullet. The Man Comes Around is poised as the next chapter in Cash's darkling fairy tale, the fourth in an ongoing series of mostly-covers albums on which he gives material by some of today's most talented (or alternately, best-selling) artists his own aged slant. Now, time was, Johnny Cash covering a song like Soundgarden's ""Rusty Cage"" was a clever novelty made impressive by his ability to infuse these modern-day rockers with overwhelming emotion. Cash's renditions of songs like Nick Cave's ""The Mercy Seat"" and Leonard Cohen's ""Bird on a Wire"" weren't so surprising, but far more powerful, as the spirit of those songs was so close to his own. The simple truth, of course, is that Cash's talent is such that he can elevate nearly any song to which he turns his ear. But on this, his fourth go-round on the same theme, it hardly seems necessary anymore; the songs of this record are taken from the most disparate ends of the musical spectrum, to no apparent end but show that he can do it. The first tragic subject of this case study is, almost predictably, Trent Reznor. (We knew it was just a matter of time, didn't we? I give it one more album before he gets around to Tool's ""Schism."") The curriculum: ""Hurt"". Now, I'm not a big advocator of the NIN sound, but I'll give ""Hurt"" that it's got a fine melody, and its arrangement here is fantastic. Cash treats the song with such sincerity and honesty that it takes on a power that it never held in Reznor's hands, infusing it with genuine heart to accompany the bitterness. But that's just it-- could Cash really fail to bring something to this desolate ballad? It's like taking target practice at the Empire State Building. There's no challenge here-- it's just driving home a point. (And incidentally, those of you anticipating the line, ""I wear this crown of shit,"" will be sorely disappointed.) Still, from the slithering blues groove of ""Personal Jesus"" to a surprisingly subtle duet with Fiona Apple on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", Cash never falters. Gorgeous, minimal arrangements highlight his emotive baritone and distill each track to its finest essentials. However, when an album consists of twelve covers and only three originals, something more than pretty arrangements is necessary, and it's called cohesion. Cash's renditions are often breathtaking in their simplicity, but rarely do they justify their presence among a dozen other similarly afflicted songs. A few exceptions are able to rise above, of course. ""Hung My Head"" is, and always has been, more Johnny Cash's than Sting's, and there's no disputing it now. And Cash and his understudy Nick Cave do justice to fellow Country hall-of-famer Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"". In these tracks, Cash finds something more than excellent composition and heartfelt regret-- he taps into the essence of each song and truly makes it his own. If he could have done this more often, and with a better selection of songs, the bulk of this record wouldn't be overshadowed by the cataclysmic magnitude of its original title track. And the weaknesses of the covers wouldn't be half as apparent if they weren't thrown into such stark contrast with an original that could stand proudly alongside ""Folsom Prison Blues"" or ""I Walk the Line"". The Cash-penned ""The Man Comes Around"" is an epic tale of apocalypse, interpreting Revelations with uplifting exuberance. Restraint, resignation, and a hope of peace pervade the prophetic imagery. Truly, the subdued fury and beauty of this track reduces everything that follows. The immediate question posed is: if this man can still write and perform works of this caliber, why is he resorting to the words and music of others? Ideally, the covers should speak this answer for themselves. Unfortunately, Cash fails to give them voice to do so, and as such, they remain unfortunately silent.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/,American,2002.0
450,Devendra Banhart,Oh Me Oh My...,Folk/Country,7.8,November 5 2002,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"He possesses a warble I won't soon forget, and if that isn't the mark of a classic balladeer I don't know what is-- except that he can paint a wild picture of slow snails, cold snow, the Charles C. Leary, and very nice people. There are probably thousands of nomadic, dark troubadours who would stumble upon some surrealist notion of wisdom if given the time and the audience, but 21-year-old Devendra Banhart draws ellipses around more than mere romantic, hard travails and etched self-portraits. In short, he isn't your everyday, everyman's folk singer, though folk aficionados would do well to weird themselves out every once in awhile with his stuff. Banhart's debut release for Michael Gira's Young God label is the work of someone presumably half-awake to conventions like ""professional recordings"" but fully aware of his own idiosyncrasies even as he performs without much trace of pretension or self-conscious nuance. The music on Oh Me Oh My is rarely more than an uncluttered combination of his unorthodox acoustic guitar pickings, more than a little tape hiss, and his immediately recognizable tenor. Banhart's voice might be a cross of Tim Buckley's flutter, Marc Bolan's timbre, and Tiny Tim's vibrato, but I would be hard pressed to claim he was imitating anyone. Similarly, his songs hit like sea chanteys started by Syd Barrett and then left mysteriously half-finished. In some cases, this is frustrating, but for the most part it seems bizarrely fitting. Banhart does share a link with traditional minstrels in the instances he opts for epic tragedy. ""Soon Is Good"", one of the longer tracks here (the shortest being all of 39 seconds), could be about the buried pain of a lost love, though the typically half-nonsensical lyrics are tough to decipher. Fortunately, the solemn, but not quite melancholy, guitar figures are uplifting enough to support Banhart's odd mumble. Later, he drops lines like, ""My toes have my favorite feet,"" in ""Michigan State"" over understated, optimistic guitar accompaniment, and somehow comes off like a weathered road-poet. Elsewhere, the songs can range from whimsical to slightly crazed. ""Lend Me Your Teeth"" stops just short of being a novelty number, perhaps due to the fact that Banhart keeps his yelp in check for most of it-- only leaping into whistle-warble territory for a brief stretch. ""Nice People"" may be the spookiest song on the album, beginning with ominous strumming, only to explode into a chorus of witchy Devendras repeating ""they certainly are nice people!"" There are moments on Oh Me Oh My that seem as if I'm overhearing a private sketch rather than a performance. Over the course of the CD, that might translate to ambience for some and annoyance for others. And the idea of a personal sketch might have been the idea all along: none of the music here was meant for release, but merely Banhart's collection of home and road tapings. It's possible that his voice would resonate more clearly with the aid of a good mic and decent mix, but that could very well detract from the considerable intimacy of his sound. If part of a folk singer's power comes from the purity of his conviction, then Banhart's promising debut is the sign of someone destined for great, strange things.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/546-oh-me-oh-my/,Young God,2002.0
451,Nas,The Lost Tapes,Rap,6.9,October 7 2002,Sam Chennault,,"It's not easy being Nas. No matter what the man does, no matter how strong he comes, people still come back with, ""It ain't Illmatic."" It's an unfair way to judge someone's work, though you can hardly deny that statement's accuracy. After all, the 90s only spawned a handful of other hip-hop records that can even be mentioned in the same breath as Nas' 1994 classic. With songs like ""Life's a Bitch"", ""One Love"", and ""N.Y. State of Mind"", and producers like Pete Rock, Primo, and Large Professor, Illmatic not only signified Nas at his nastiest and most poetic, but it also represented the pinnacle of 90s NYC hip-hop. The falloff has been a bitch; Nas' sins include releasing what can politely be considered a string of mediocre albums, ghostwriting for Will Smith, and immersing himself in enough beefs to keep a fleet of hip-hop gossip columnists busy for years. But, after all these disappointments, we still hold out hope for the return of hip-hop's prodigal son. And The Lost Tapes does, on the surface, seem like a possible candidate for that revival. Ostentatiously released for the real headz, this collection features tracks only previously released on mixtapes or over the Internet. Hopefully, this means none of the jiggy, commercial-friendly nonsense that's really dragged down his records the past few years. The album's first track, ""Doo Rags"", finds Nas doing what he does best: reminiscing about his youth in the ghetto over a jazzy, piano-based loop. Nas namechecks Beat Street Breakers and the X-Clan while railing against ""political thugs in shark suits [who] persuade us to pull triggers."" At the end of the second verse, he raps, ""Your paper money was the death of Christ/ And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life/ It's like a cycle."" After the science of ""Doo Rags"", the resurrection of Rakim's only true successor seems like a real possibility. Unfortunately, Nas' return is pretty short-lived. On the next track, ""My Way"", Nas returns to his pimped-out, diamond-studded-glocks persona. He raps, ""Living my life like everyday is my last night/ Alcoholic on toilets I shit blood/ Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug."" Yeah, okay. But it must be said that Nas does add a little more to the gangsta formula than most. In the second verse of the song, he gives a vivid retelling of the death of his friend Ill Will, whose name Nas has used for his record label, and concedes that he ""still feels broke with millions in the bank."" The Alchamist (aka Primo-in-Training) provides a nice but somewhat generic beat. Ever the provocateur, Nas does take a couple of shots at his rivals. On ""Purple"", he raps, ""I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers,"" while on ""Everybody's Crazy"", he insults someone by calling them a ""Sisqo fag."" In ""Black Zombie"", Nas veers back towards black conscious, deriding the media's stereotypes of African-American as gangstas and hoes, the inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. After hearing Nas spin gangsta narratives on ""Blaze a 50"" and ""My Way"", and after being subjected to the hype surrounding his long string of self-provoked beefs, it isn't hard to spot the hypocrisy in these otherwise noble sentiments. But, when you think about it, haven't the boldest and greatest of us been mired in contradictions: Lenin, Bill Clinton, Bob Dylan, Tupac Shakur... So, maybe we can forgive Nas of his moral contradictions. But what's a little harder to swallow are some of the beats on this album. The Barry White sample on ""No Idea's Original"" is nice, but it doesn't fit Nas' flow on the track. And while ""Blaze a 50"" is an interesting narrative involving betrayal, sex, and murder, the generic violin-based track almost ruins it. Despite its flaws, though, The Lost Tapes is nice. Not a return to form, per se, but possibly as close as we're likely to get. Besides, after all the years and disappointments, the expectations for Nas have finally subsided. What I'm saying is, if you can manage to forget Illmatic, you might actually like the guy again.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5709-the-lost-tapes/,"Columbia,Ill Will",2002.0
452,Neko Case,Blacklisted,Folk/Country,7.9,August 26 2002,Eric Carr,Contributor,"""Sit down, son. We need to have a talk, a serious talk about the evils of Country Western music. Don't give me that innocent look; I found this Neko Case CD in your room, and I know, you're probably thinking, 'But, dad! Neko doesn't even play country!' True enough, but this is how it always starts. There's trouble in Ms Case's witchy, alt-country siren-song, mark my words. Boy, I've seen the best minds of my generation lost to Garth Brooks and midget rodeos, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let it happen to you. Sure, today it's a little bit of Neko Case, but pretty soon you'll be listening to 'Folsom Prison Blues' on the weekends, then before you know it you'll be twanging up every day after school and buying CDs by anyone named Travis or Loretta. And by then, it'll be too late. I'm confiscating this copy of The Virginian for your own good. You're barely passable as sons go already, so be a good kid. Stick to Shellac."" A few years later, I'm listening to Neko's third full-length, Blacklisted, and I finally understand what my dad was worried about. I'm not about to run out and buy Alan Jackson's back catalog or anything-- a healthy dislike of Kentucky Fried Music has been bred into me. But even to my yankee sensibilities, the subtle influence of the old South on this album is charming, even beautiful. Beneath its jangle and melancholy, a faint country soul gently simmers, occasionally bubbling to the surface. Maybe it's just the barest hint of a Southern drawl in the Virginia-born Case's dusky, breathless vocals (the accent is still detectable though she was raised primarily in Tacoma, WA), or the twangy banjo and steel pedal melodies, but it's in there, and goddamnit, I just can't resist. Tensely picked banjo and twelve-string guitar open ""Things That Scare Me"" with that timeless trademark of the most haunting western balladry: the sinister vibe of imminent danger, a distant peal of thunder before the sky falls. But the foreboding here is merely a ruse-- nothing comes but the slow, sad rain of ""Deep Red Bells"", whose backing ""ooh's"" and echoes of steel lend an air of deep longing. This song's clouds part briefly in a moment of silence when Neko plaintively intones, ""Where does this mean world cast its cold eye?/ Who's left to suffer long about you?"" Later, the refrain is followed by a sparkling bridge like a glimpse of sun before the rain returns. With instrumental assistance from notables like Giant Sand's Howe Gelb and his Calexico counterparts Joey Burns and John Convertino-- as well as Chicago alt-country crooner Kelly Hogan and Canadian singer/songwriter Mary Margaret O'Hara on backing vocals-- Blacklisted's accompaniment is roundly excellent and evocative, but Case's voice is what really sells the record. Her opaque wail is more confident here than ever, topping even her sturdy melodic blasts on the New Pornographers' now-legendary ""Letter from an Occupant."" But where she simply belted that tune out to gloriously compliment the band's snapping power-pop, her performance on Blacklisted is dense with emotional heft and more richly expressive. Her rendition of Aretha Franklin's ""Runnin' Out of Fools""-- reworked ever so slightly to match the tone of this record, yet remaining largely faithful to the original-- is the best evidence of this, conveying ecstasy and loss with an elastic buoyancy so full of eloquent depth that you feel as though it could swallow you whole and spit you out on another plane entirely. I've stayed off the C&W; ever since my pop had that little talk at me, but when its influence is employed as beautifully and flawlessly as it is on Blacklisted, it makes me wonder what other experiences could be lying in wait for me. Blacklisted is gorgeous heartache, my soul be damned-- and ""Folsom Prison Blues"" ain't too shabby, either. Dad, if you're reading this, I know that you listened to my copy of The Virginian even after you warned me about its gateway effects; I saw you. So if you see me a few years down the line in a rusted-out pickup with a bumper sticker that screams ""Never Forget!"" in neon reds and blues, and you want to know who taught me how to really fall for this C&W; stuff... it was you, alright? I learned it by watching you.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1323-blacklisted/,Bloodshot,2002.0
453,David Bowie,Heathen,Rock,7.8,June 16 2002,Eric Carr,Contributor,"I'm tired of attending funerals for David Bowie's career. I mean, they're always pleasant, catered affairs, and the chance to hobnob with a star-studded crowd of washed-up mourners like Lou Reed and Iggy Pop is undeniably great, but David never actually shows up. Critics have tried to write him off for more than a decade, and his work has been mostly sub-par even longer. But somehow, some way, he's managed to scrape together enough of the old Bowie charm on every release to keep alive the hope that he might just have one final hurrah left in him. Unlike some of his contemporaries (I'm looking at you, Iggy), he might, conceivably, still have a fighting chance. But while everyone's busy measuring his latest work against the towering legacy of Ziggy and the Spiders and looking ahead to his next last gasp, it would be easy to overlook that Heathen is the best Bowie release in years. But so what? Bowie committed the unpardonable sin of being too good, too soon. For an artist to produce an album as exquisitely relevant and inventive as Hunky Dory is rare, but to follow it with the colossus of Ziggy Stardust, and even Aladdin Sane, Low, and Scary Monsters-- he made genius sound so easy. With those first few groundbreaking albums, though, he utterly screwed himself. The shadow of his early work will follow him forever, and having hit the twilight of his career after tripping and falling over that 1987 snot-rocket, Never Let Me Down, it has loomed larger than ever. Heathen will surely be condemned by those who cannot forgive him for his past greatness, and will likely be loved by a few who still imagine strains of ""Space Oddity"" beneath its refrains. It's hard to shake the thought that even thirty years later, some people still seem to be expecting another Ziggy. Yet Heathen doesn't herald a second coming for David Bowie-- not by a longshot. The youthful urgency of his early work is long gone. But that hasn't stopped him from making an album that is easily his best work since the halcyon days of faux-cockney accents and gender bending theatrics a la Scary Monsters, and that's good news. Bowie seems to have finally realized that he's just been trying too damn hard. Where 2000's Hours was a brooding, wrist-slitting account of Bowie's laments about growing old and irrelevant, Heathen is the sound of acceptance. He's relaxed, even serene, and the songs clearly reflect this with a nonchalant charm reminiscent of the Bowie of old. This is not a particularly cheery record: ""Sunday"" is a somber, almost sinister chant that builds into an ascending chorus of warm synths and percussion-- a tense, minimal remix of the best moments of Earthling, if you will. In what will surely be the song most often quoted by record critics, ""Slip Away,"" Bowie muses: ""Some of us will always stay behind/ Down in space it's always 1982/ The joke we always knew,"" a brief moment of smiling recognition at the state of his career, fans, and detractors in the wake of his past glory days. Gorgeous and sad, it evokes the simplicity of the past as Bowie sings of ""sailing over Coney Island"" to a lone piano melody and a compelling Moog-y electronic refrain. ""Slow Burn"" is the strongest of Bowie's original material on Heathen-- a moody, bouncy piece with a bass/sax combo that vaguely elicits a 60s pop undercurrent with guitar work from Pete Townshend (yeah, that Pete Townshend!). Townshend's help here is appreciated, mostly because it means the guitar isn't being played by Reeves Gabrels. If Bowie had considered bringing him in earlier, he could have avoided the horror of a car crash like Hours' ""The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell."" Fortunately, Townshend's guitar noodling never steps into the realm of being entirely gratuitous, and as with all the best songs on Heathen, Bowie's vocals are wisely left to dominate. But oddly, it's the covers that are truly the highlight of the album. Bowie tries his hand at the Pixies' ""Cactus"" (a move which might make the album's title sound ironically appropriate)-- but take a deep breath. Everything's going to be okay. Mercifully, he handles the song very faithfully, and actually does it justice. He's a far cry from Black Francis, but Bowie's voice is so amazingly distinctive that it almost sounds like a different song. He then moves on to Neil Young's ""I've Been Waiting for You."" I don't know what's caused the current rash of Neil Young covers lately, but at least Bowie's old enough to make this sound a little more natural than most might. Bowie hasn't touched rock 'n' roll like this in years, and that he can still carry it off this well is a pleasant surprise. Heathen's piece de resistance, though, is the phenomenal cover of ""I Took a Trip In a Gemini Spaceship"" by The Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Name-based alter ego issues aside, this song is smooth. It's got a fast-paced electronic rhythm to quicken the pulse, and dulcet tones to soothe the ear-- nothing but laid-back electropop fun from start to finish. It's the kind of thing they'll be playing in the lounge of the International Space Station in about ten years or so, assuming the capsule doesn't get pimped out as an orbiting bachelor pad for N*SYNC or something stupid like that. Bowie is obviously never going to recapture his trend-setting finesse of yesteryear, but at least he seems okay with that. And that's this record's greatest strength. Back when he was busy reminding everyone how out of it he really was by touring with Trent Reznor, he started to play ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and I actually heard a kid, maybe only two years younger than me, say, ""Oh, cool. He's covering a Nirvana song."" If that's not a warning sign, I don't know what is. Yes, David, the music world is moving on without you, but you can't end things with Heathen-- some of us, myself included, are still waiting for that final blaze of glory. Before you go, you've got to let the kids know what they missed out on.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/882-heathen/,"Columbia,ISO",2002.0
454,My Morning Jacket,Chocolate and Ice EP,Rock,7.3,April 22 2002,Kevin Adickes,,"It's funny how selective our nation can be when arbitrarily assigning kitsch value to various pockets of humanity. The line between 'nostalgia' and 'bad taste' is incredibly thin. Whereas whole genres, turns-of-phrase, and iconic allusions to fads of yore tend to erratically resurface on the pop-culture landscape, other seemingly perfect candidates for revivalist lampooning lie dormant, unscathed by the trials of time. 2002 seems to be ground zero for kitsch-- the two most notable revivals of the moment being Gary Coleman and the commercial media's preoccupation with 1980s music. Like every red-blooded, patriotic American, I enjoy a good laugh at Gary's expense. He's certainly kept our nation together during these trying and uncertain times. Yet, the chances of him ever being regarded as a serious actor are slimmer than the chances of a new-wave renaissance. While My Morning Jacket have always steered clear of campiness, Chocolate and Ice finds the group taking a few steps back from their recent triumphs. This is an exploratory EP that really serves as a vehicle for the group's 24-minute epic ""Cobra,"" a stark, predominantly instrumental composition that bears a remarkable resemblance to the Steve Miller Band's 1982 ode to sexuality in the world of professional magic, ""Abracadabra."" To their credit, My Morning Jacket manage to carry this song for nearly its entire duration-- a feat only a handful of other groups might be capable of-- but the fact remains that bad 80s synth does not make for a good source of inspiration. Fortunately, the rest of the EP is more eclectic and rewarding. Opener ""Can You See the Hard Helmet on My Head?"" transcends its embarrasingly bad title to find My Morning Jacket taking musical cues from Jeff Tweedy and company. It's here that Jim James' whiskey-soaked voice, one of the group's strongest assets, is at its finest-- wavering between reassurance and aching desperation while hiding behind a dozen or so coats of reverb. Though these guys have always been relatively sparse in their arrangements, Chocolate and Ice takes the 'less-is-more' philosophy further than any of the group's previous efforts, possibly as a cautionary measure against the muddy production value. The dynamic is intriguing, to say the least, as tracks like ""Sweetheart"" and ""Sooner"" pay homage to the 'couples only' dance music of the 1950s-- think Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly, and Roy Orbison. My Morning Jacket are just convincing enough to make the repressed adolescent in me cry right along with them sometimes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5532-chocolate-and-ice-ep/,Badman,2002.0
455,Wu-Tang Clan,Iron Flag,Rap,7.5,March 26 2002,Christopher Dare,,"How the hell do you cover the Wu-Tang Clan? They form like Voltron, and I'm supposed to piece out this puzzle. Each MC has like three alternate personalities, multiplying the angles of attack. But Iron Flag gives me an approach: it's the most solid Wu album in years. I guess the Clan wanted to slice through rumors that they were falling off, because they holed up at the Wu mansion and punched out twelve solid cuts. First they feint with ""In the Hood,"" for once an intro that's listenable. It's RZA's panoramic sweep from freestyle diss to jump-up anthem, with brass blasting and glocks clicking in the background. Then the segue to ""Rules,"" which opens with Ghostface Killah just like on 36 Chambers. Piano jabs keep a tight rhythm as he belts, ""Who the fuck knocked our buildings down/ Who the man behind the World Trade massacres, step up now!"" Ghost gets his in, but of course Method Man gets more, taunting, ""Who y'all kiddin'? Tryin' to act like my shoe fittin'/ Confused with your head up your ass like who's shittin'?"" Still, it's weird to hear him up in the chorus asking, ""How the fuck did we get so cool, man?"" We know it, Meth, you don't gotta say it. But it's obvious the Wu wanted the sharpest tongues in the front because he's all over Iron Flag, as are Ghost, Raekwon and a surprisingly on-point Inspecta Deck. On the opposite, Ol' Dirty Bastard's conspicuously absent, doing time for crack possession and fleeing probation. If anything, the Clan's more cohesive without the presence of that chaotic God. They're all in together now on ""Uzi (Pinky Ring),"" the prototype single where every head gets a verse. The RZA's clearly on to some old-school flavor, and it's a lovely thing because it makes each song perfect for cruising. There's horn samples lacing most tracks, bringing an upbeat, playful vibe-- despite the dirges, Rakeem knows how to have a good time. ""Chrome Wheels"" drops these nasty mechanical squiggles that combine and interlock with bumping bass. I thought I'd dread the day that divas came to the Wu, but Madame D begs, ""Bang us in your cars, bang us in your Jeeps, bang that shit retarded,"" and it's far from R&B; (""Rapping Bullshit,"" per RZA parlance). Even the tracks he farms out to Wu-Tang Incorp. affiliates thump hard. ""One of These Days"" rolls on funk guitars and a blunt beat courtesy of Nick ""Fury"" Loftin; the southern-playa-listic Cadillac music keeps U-God from ruining it when he's mumbling about being ""so unique"" and then wanting out of the Clan (?!). But U-God redeems with his verse on ""Soul Power,"" where he sketches the best vignette: ""Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom/ Dr. J before Jordan, Al Green on the organ."" Flavor Flav provides the shout-out chorus, and he's kidding around with Meth at the end, talking about family in Long Island. Lyrically the Wu are much more earthy on Iron Flag-- maybe the ""thousand-dollar lesbians"" weren't catching many fans? Likewise, there's about five percent of the Five Percent, though GZA of course drops his characteristic science. You don't get much introspection, just grandstanding like on ""Y'all Been Warned,"" where RZA digs, ""You can't Etch-a-Sketch all my rhyme threat/ Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat step."" The only time they return to the languorous street noir of tracks like ""C.R.E.A.M."" is on ""Babies,"" a grim Raekwon/Ghostface tale about a crooked cop. The title track is the lone downtempo diversion. The needle scratches and the synths blow like wind before the music descends into ""The Glock,"" a subsection with little more than a percussion loop rumbling and the Clan gathered round shouting into the mic. It comes across real cold, but then ""Dashing"" ends the album with Deck singing nursery rhymes; GZA leaves behind a smooth verse James Bond-style before he disappears. With all the catchy choruses, each song on Iron Flag hits like another single to be released. The kung-fu samples are back, Masta Killa's still trying to carve out a name for himself, and the Wu prove they never need guests like Snoop or Isaac Hayes to throw down a strong joint. It's an album about brotherhood, fueled by the national war but no doubt sparked on a more personal level. As Method Man deadpans on ""Uzi,"" ""Give you the same advice that I gave my wife: don't fuck with mine."" Damn.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8746-iron-flag/,"Columbia,Loud",2001.0
456,Radiohead,I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings EP,Rock,8.0,December 17 2001,Matt LeMay,Contributor,"The bright lights flashed in unison like cheap aluminum UFOs in a starless sky. My eyes convulsed in time with the massive flashes of white, but I didn't really mind. Somehow, Franky and I had made it to that sacred place where the lights are far too bright and the sound is far too loud. The excitement was palpable. Though the vast majority of the 10,000 or so people present was directly behind me, and well outside of my field of view, I could sense the size and excitement of the crowd around me. I turned to Franky, who stared in rapt attention at the stage, absolutely silent. Finally, the moment arrived. These five beings graced the stage like the gods of old descending from Olympus, illuminated by the fiery rays of Helios' chariot. The scene was as heavenly and beautiful as Jesus and Buddha playing handball on Jerry Garcia's assflab. The crowd's response was as loud and forceful as a tidal wave of live kittens. Yet, Franky remained silent. Finally, as the band prepared for their first song, he turned his head to me, his brown eyes shiny and round like a sheep turd soaked in glitter. Surely, he was aware that this was the single most magical moment of his life ever. Staring awestruck at the massive crowd behind my head, Franky opened his mouth slightly, prepared to speak. And the words he spoke, which seemed to flow straight from his soul like a leaky thermos of godly ambrosia, have remained with me to this day: ""Thom Yorke just got 10,000 people to pay $60 to stare at his ugly ass."" Sure enough, the audience seemed to be positively transfixed by the image of Yorke, his lazy eye dragging two or three centimeters behind him, twitching and wailing. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to equate the show to Radiohead's music itself-- big rock laced with intrigue, fragility, and ugliness. On I Might Be Wrong, a good deal of the essence of Radiohead's live show is distilled onto an eight-track EP. And while some moments are absolutely stellar, I Might Be Wrong is only a shadow of what a Radiohead live album could have been. Like most Radiohead shows, I Might Be Wrong opens with ""The National Anthem."" The song's introduction, with Thom Yorke breathing in staccato over Colin Greenwood's thunderous bassline and Jonny Greenwood's skillful manipulation of the primitive Ondes-Martenot, is absolutely wonderful. Without a horn section, though, the song never really develops as it does on Kid A, trailing off without a satisfying conclusion. ""The National Anthem"" is followed by ""I Might Be Wrong,"" a song that wouldn't be even remotely interesting in its live incarnation if not for the subtle shifts in dynamics that grace the middle and end of the song. ""Morning Bell,"" like ""The National Anthem,"" builds to a meandering ending. But it meanders with enough grace to keep it interesting, with Ed O'Brien and Jonny Greenwood working their trademark magic with effects-laden guitars and synthesizers. With ""Like Spinning Plates,"" I Might Be Wrong hits its stride. Recasting the song as a piano ballad with eerie synthesized strings, Radiohead turned one of Amnesiac's most cryptically brilliant tracks into something much more emotional and accessible without being at all sappy or manipulative. With this new version, the song's melody-- complete with the eerily, vaudevillian quality that inhabits it during the chorus-- takes center stage, showcasing Radiohead's songwriting virtuosity rather than their sonic adventurousness. ""Like Spinning Plates"" is followed by ""Idioteque"" and ""Everything in its Right Place,"" possibly the two finest tracks from Kid A, and certainly one of the better sections of this EP. The former succeeds in capturing the energy Yorke channels during live interpretations of the song, whereas the latter takes the aural experimentation of the album version one step further, with sublime digital manipulations building electronic tapestries of sound. After the schizophrenic meltdown of ""Idioteque"" and the catharsis of ""Everything in Its Right Place,"" an entirely unexceptional version of ""Dollars and Cents"" is more than a little bit of a letdown, as it lacks both momentum and innovation. But ""Dollars and Cents"" is followed by I Might Be Wrong's main attraction, the previously unreleased ""True Love Waits."" An acoustic outtake from the OK Computer era, ""True Love Waits"" is absolutely gorgeous. With signature unexpected chord changes and a melody that both aches and soothes, ""True Love Waits"" can hold its own against any song on OK Computer, and makes a very welcome ending to I Might Be Wrong. But while tracks like ""Like Spinning Plates"" and ""True Love Waits"" certainly justify the existence of I Might Be Wrong, the EP seems purposely limited in a way that's immensely frustrating. At only eight songs, the disc is being sold and marketed (and priced) as a full-length album. Given the fact that so many shows were recorded in preparation for this EP, there's absolutely no reason that I Might Be Wrong should have been limited to eight tracks. Similarly frustrating is the fact that every single track here, aside from ""True Love Waits,"" is taken from either Kid A or Amnesiac. The inclusion of a live version of ""Fake Plastic Trees,"" ""Karma Police,"" or ""Just"" would have rounded off the record nicely. Sadly, one can't shake the feeling that this disc exists largely as a promotional item for Radiohead's last two albums. The quality of the recordings and performances on I Might Be Wrong is certainly top-notch. But Internet bootlegs-- most notably a soundboard recording from Nijmegen, a small city in Holland-- present a better, more complete picture of the Radiohead live experience. Still, even with better live documents available for free, it's hard to resist an officially sanctioned live EP with a few absolutely stellar tracks. And although I Might Be Wrong is obnoxiously incomplete, the fact remains that Thom Yorke just got 100,000 people to spend $17.99 for eight songs. Good for him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6657-i-might-be-wrong-live-recordings-ep/,Capitol,2001.0
457,Miles Davis,The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions,Jazz,9.5,November 7 2001,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Miles had a new girl. Her name was Betty, and she told him all about what the kids were listening to. Being a singer herself, she had some connection to the inside world of pop and soul, but mostly, she was just a lot younger than him, and was probably instinctively more drawn to that music than Miles was. It's not as if Miles was completely out of touch with popular trends, but on tour and in the studio as frequently as he was, one could hardly blame him for receiving information second-hand. Betty told him all about Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and the Fifth Dimension (hopefully in that order), and he was keen to investigate the new sounds. Years later he would brag about being able to put together a rock band that would blow all the others away, but he approached the idiom cautiously and methodically at first. Additionally, Miles was getting insider info from his drummer, Tony Williams. Tony was younger even than Betty Mabry, and although he'd come of age deep inside one of the most popular bands in jazz (even if jazz's popularity wasn't what it had been ten years previous), he had his finger very much on the pulse of hip new music. Tony had especially enjoyed the new funk from James Brown and the boogaloo grooves being played by Jimmy McGriff and Richard ""Groove"" Holmes' bands. Betty and Tony were playing a key role for Miles Davis in the late 60s, even beyond their personal and performing ones. The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions release details a six-month stretch in 1968-69 when the various advisors in Miles' life would see their seeds sprout into fauna so full of life and outrageous fertility that the face of his idiom would be forever changed. Of course, the final product of all this investigation and experimentation has been the subject of countless essays on Miles' genius, but it bears closer inspection to reveal that the trumpeter didn't just up and create this music out of thin air. He spent months in the studio rehearsing on tape, midwifing his ideas. In late '68, Miles was a painter using one canvas to try and retry his masterpiece, continually repainting over areas where, though the ideas were fresh and the colors vibrant, the concept was yet immature. As a palette, Miles chose only the best primaries from two continents. At the time, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, and Herbie Hancock were mainstays from his second great quintet. Bassist Ron Carter had become so busy with sessions in New York that Miles had to find a replacement. In between gigs in England, he saw Dave Holland's band opening for Bill Evans. Miles was immediately struck by the young bassist, and sent word via Philly Jo Jones and his manager (Miles had the best connections) that he wanted Dave. Elsewhere, when it became apparent Hancock was going to have trouble making a recording date, Williams recommended the young Boston native Chick Corea as a replacement. This quintet (Davis, Shorter, Williams, Holland and Corea) produced the first tunes on this release in September 1968. ""Mademoiselle Mabry"" is a sprawling ode to both Miles' new girl and Hendrix's ""The Wind Cries Mary."" Miles had started using electric keyboards in the studio almost exclusively by that time, and Corea's relatively conservative figures (when they aren't directly quoting the Hendrix tune), are the dominant timbre in this piece at first. He hadn't picked up the Fender Rhodes piano that would color almost every tune Miles performed thereafter, and the primitive sounds produced here betray the band's uncertainty about where the tune (or their sound) was going. Davis takes the first solo, similar to his exploratory efforts on Miles in the Sky earlier that year, over a non-groove from Williams' toms and Holland's steady, if rather static, low-end line. One of the reasons sets like this are great is that you really get a feeling for the musicians' progress during that time, and if this tune is any indication, things had only just begun to get interesting. ""Frelon Brun"" gives a much better idea of the revolutionary sounds ahead. Williams wastes no time in hammering out a hard funk break from the kit, and Corea had apparently already learned the importance of the repetitive chordal vamp to this music. Davis takes a short solo, as if testing the waters, which is followed by Shorter's seemingly more confident strides in funky acid soul. The music actually ends up closer to what the band played after Bitches Brew than anything on In a Silent Way. Two months later, Miles reconvened with the same musicians, adding Herbie Hancock on Rhodes to form a sextet, to begin the next phase of the trip. The band played music closer to Miles' vision on ""Two Faced"": mystical, impressionistic soundscapes courtesy of the two-keyboard attack, subtle, though insistent drumming from Williams, and a by-then typically moaning, weary head covered by Davis and Shorter. The band was also not afraid of stretching the tunes out to 10, 15, or 20 minutes if it meant they'd find something useful along the way. Miles (with the help of producer Teo Macero) had discovered tape edits from progressive pop records of the time (Sgt. Pepper being a chief influence), and this tune, similar to ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's About That Time,"" was constructed from several stop/start fragments. Later the same month, Miles found yet another missing ingredient in keyboardist (and Ã¼ber-influence on the sound of all resulting jazz-rock fusion) Joe Zawinul. The two men had known each other for several years prior to these sessions, but Miles could only admire the Austrian's playing from afar. Zawinul had made great strides in uniting jazz and soul with Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley's band in the mid-60s, even scoring a pop hit with ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy."" He also brought an earthy sense of melody and classicism to the mix, and would ultimately become a major architect for the sound of Miles' band. ""Splashdown,"" a previously unreleased piece of tense, Rhodes-led jazz-funk, was recorded with the first three-keyboard version of the band. However, Zawinul's influence wasn't really apparent until sessions from a couple of days later, when the band played two of his compositions: ""Ascent"" and the subsequent concert staple, ""Directions."" The former seemingly caught the band in transition, with its theretofore-unprecedented use of tonal clusters and rootless ""comping"" from the keyboards, and an absence of any drum pattern at all, save an odd tambourine pulse. ""Directions"" was another story altogether, as the band busts out of the peaceful into the wild. This was the most ""rock"" Miles Davis had sounded like up to that point, and the two versions of the tune on this set are very similar to what Miles' concerts would sound like from '69 through the early 70s. Also of note on this session is that drummer Jack DeJohnette made his first appearance with a Miles Davis band in the studio, lending his distinct, high-energy stomp to the proceedings. The band went on the road for a few months after that, and returned to the studio in February 1969. More changes: John McLaughlin had been recruited on guitar (another Tony Williams recommendation), and Williams had returned on drums. This time around, Miles was looking for what he called a ""groove album."" The strategy was that the band would play a tune (on this session, ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way""), based on charts, but were free to explore what regions the performance yielded to them. Afterwards, Miles and Teo would evaluate the pieces, and form the ""groove"" in Miles' head from whatever was on tape. The original, previously unreleased version of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" from that session will shock most people accustomed to the legendary In a Silent Way version. First of all, there's an exposition and melodic theme that was completely discarded in the proper version. Also, the famous robotic hi-hat pattern doesn't even begin until almost five minutes in. One of the surprises (some might even say disappointments) of this set is the realization that this music wasn't just the product of Miles' muse; there were hours of sessions and rehearsals before the band, Miles and Teo discovered what it was they were looking for. The humble beginnings of this tune still have much in common with straight jazz, though with a markedly progressive bent. The same session yielded two versions of ""In a Silent Way."" The first is very different to what ended up on the album, with a faux-bossanova beat and Holland's light-footed bassline supporting the classic melody line. The second version is the version that was used on the album, with McLaughlin's heavenly solo statement of the main theme, and Miles' delicate answer. The band also performed ""It's About That Time"" (definitely a fruitful afternoon) in what was essentially the final version, complete with tape edits and loops compiled by Teo. Two days later, Miles was back in the studio. He had a couple of new pieces, ""The Ghetto Walk"" and ""Early Minor,"" neither of which ended up on In a Silent Way. The first tune is a hard funk almost-blues featuring Joe Chambers laying down a slinky groove on drums, while McLaughlin, Shorter and Miles give up equally subversive solos. Most interesting is the middle section trip-down, wherein the ghost of the session two days prior sneaks in with a little atmospheric feather float. ""Early Minor"" is another Zawinul original that's indicative of the kind of hyper-impressionism he would play (with Shorter) with Weather Report shortly after making Bitches Brew with Miles. It's also confusing as to just why this didn't make the cut for the original In a Silent Way release, because it features similar cascading Rhodes figures, and very nice, gentle pulse keeping by Chambers. The set ends with the LP versions of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's About That Time."" Miles fans didn't get to hear everything that came in between this album and its predecessor, so the sessions documented on this collection will make the leap from the cautious dabbling in rock textures of Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro to the full-blown jazz-opera of Bitches Brew. These recordings seem a lot more logically arranged and planned. This is good and bad: while few people would doubt the genius of Miles Davis as a player, composer and bandleader, it's evident that he was running on blind faith more than once during that time, and that he was learning on the go as much as his sidemen were. Part of the mystique surrounding this album, for me, has always been that it seemed to come out of nowhere, like a beacon of uncanny originality and visionary foresight. Apparently, it did have roots, and while the music will always be some of my favorite from Miles, I can't honestly say that seeing the blueprints for his magic translates to the same sheer joy as did the end results. But, it's still magic music, and it's still Miles. The worst thing you could ever say about a set like this is that it's almost too educational, and of course, that's not really a criticism, is it?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2199-the-complete-in-a-silent-way-sessions/,Columbia,2001.0
458,John Coltrane,The Olatunji Concert: The Last Live Recording,Jazz,10.0,October 15 2001,Luke Buckman,,"""He not busy being born is busy dying.""
- Bob Dylan, ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding"" ""Live flesh and coursing blood, hearts, brains, souls spluttering fire!""
-LeRoi Jones, ""Black Art"" April 23rd, 1967. John Coltrane appears for his penultimate public performance before a crowd at Babatunde Olatunji's Center for African Culture in New York City. Three months later, liver cancer would claim his life. He would play once more in front of a live crowd, but the last available live recording is documented here. On this set, he's bolstered by drummer Rashied Ali, bassist Jimmy Garrison, pianist Alice Coltrane, Pharaoh Sanders on tenor sax and Algie Dewitt on bata drum (a Yoruba instrument). For legions of jazz aficionados around the globe, this final live document is something of a Holy Grail. And now, thanks to sound engineer Bernard Drayton (who still had possession of the master tapes), anyone with $15 can finally get their mitts on one of the most historic documents in all of 20th century American music. Coltrane spent the last years of his life engaged in a mission that few could understand. As witnessed on A Love Supreme and other recordings during those later years, his ultimate objective was that of a continued spiritual awakening. Whereas the objective itself was not that difficult to grasp, Coltrane's means of attaining it were far from conventional. Abandoning the preconceived notions of tonality, and immersed within a musical state of dissonance, Coltrane's music became a communicative attempt at reaching a higher plane. Spawned during one of the most tumultuous eras in history, Coltrane's ideas were reflective of a period in which the foundations of American life trembled to the core. Influenced by the nation's entrenchment in war, its social and political upheavals, and its civil rights and protest movements, John's music deserted almost any semblance of traditional form in a move toward celestial harmony and universality. In the early months of 1967, faced not just with the chaos of society, Coltrane waged his own personal war with death and his music again shifted. What's documented here is that personal warfare, replete with bursting explosions and a splattering of machine-gun notes. No sooner than Billy Taylor can introduce John as ""one of the most remarkable forces in jazz today,"" Coltrane comes up front and center on ""Ogunde,"" opening the set with a warm, bluesy moan. But this is only temporary. Almost immediately, the rest of the band in tow, Coltrane embarks on a trans-dimensional flight, bleating and coaxing sounds from his sax, and escalating at a fever pace to the highest register with guttural whoops and hollers. ""Ogunde,"" based on the Afro-Brazilian song ""Ogunde Varere,"" is an almost thirty-minute wall of dissonance, peppered with shrieks and howls. It's as if Coltrane is expending every imaginable source of personal energy here to create a swirling maelstrom of noise. Coltrane and Sanders swap solos: John rips out with a weeping wail before ascending into a full-blown shriek attack; Pharoah begins playfully, reeling off a fiery solo, dancing around a theme, and then descending into a grunt-filled rage. Ali focuses on polyrhythms and spacial dancing, consistently adding dimensions and crossing barriers, taking the band into something otherworldly, while Garrison's bass remains muscular, anchoring the sound and expanding the framework. Alice Coltrane's percussive plonks and thuds drift in and out of the background before she rolls out her own deft solo, scrambling around the melody and filling the space rapidly with sixteenth notes while the saxophonists quietly wait for their scorching return. Soon, Coltrane roars back in, the band following on his comet's tail. Coltrane and Sanders successively spit out anguished yelps while the band soars into wraithlike dimensions, teetering on the precipice of a volcanic eruption. From here, the track remains full-throttle until it ends with Coltrane and Sanders invoking the spiritual via an ecstatic rite of fire. After Coltrane humbly gives his thanks to the elated audience, Jimmy Garrison steps into the spotlight for a lengthy bass solo that introduces Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""My Favorite Things."" A staple of Coltrane's set since the early 60s, ""My Favorite Things"" had now morphed from The Sound of Music's simple innocence into something altogether beastly and monstrous. Garrison flexes his chops for well over seven minutes with brawn and grit, piecing together a skeletal structure and beating the path for the others' departure into unknown terrain. What follows is music overflowing with such emotional and spiritual intensity that it floods your living room. Coltrane's bleats and squeals are drenched with a searing pain. It's like the sound of rending flesh, the tune ripped apart and broken into sorrowful hollers and moans. With the band thundering behind them, the two sax players are intent on dousing every inch of that NYC block with their incendiary fury. Explosions, barking yawps, shrill high-register runs, and throaty, rasping groans-- the place sounds like it's going to spontaneously combust. Occasionally, there's slight recognition of the Rodgers & Hammerstein theme as Coltrane references the motif before descending into death howls and mournful prayer. If ""Ogunde"" was a full-throttled blare, ""My Favorite Things"" clambers rapidly out of this realm and into permanent celestial gravitation. Coltrane maintains velocity at this pace for nearly twenty minutes, caught in a firestorm from which no one will walk away unscathed. For every intent and purpose, this is difficult music. It's the demanding sound of a man faced with impending death, yet unafraid to carry forward and remain steadfast to his intense, singular vision of music as a universal bridge. With every note, Coltrane chases a higher power in an attempt to transcend the corporeal. For the unprepared listener, it might all be too much-- not only because of the sheer intensity of noise levels or dissonance, but because this is the sound of a man who knows every breath he draws inches him one step closer to the grave. Yet, the sadness this evokes is overwhelmed by the pure beauty of a man being rebirthed, recreated, and reimagined. The Last Live Recording is a deliriously scattered mess of joy and pain, intermingled and bound up within Coltrane's unbridled and luminescent energy. And now it stands as his parting gesture: one last moment bursting out at the seams with elation and ferocity, an awe-inspiring testament to life.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1550-the-olatunji-concert-the-last-live-recording/,Impulse!,2001.0
459,Miles Davis,"Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970): It's About That Time",Jazz,9.5,October 10 2001,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Would you know greatness if you saw it? This is the eternal question for people like me, posting their supposedly well thought-out pontifications for anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to read. The issue of being able to distinguish what's good from what isn't seems like a job ill-suited for anyone who doesn't have the power of omniscience, or at least a good track record with uncovering genius. And yet, this is a request made by artists all the time-- that of acceptance, or some kind of recognition of what they've produced. Maybe it's not really a matter of taste, but closer to keen perception and foresight. But while some folks may pride themselves in their ability to find interesting art, it takes popular consensus to brand a piece or work ""great"" or ""revolutionary."" Herein lies the dilemma: if you aren't able to recognize the inherent greatness of a particular piece of art, how can you appreciate any art at all? Or, if you do think you see genius somewhere, how do you communicate this to somebody else? These are the kinds of questions I have for the audience assembled for the Miles Davis Quintet performance at the Fillmore East in New York City on March 7th, 1970. Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970): It's About That Time is the official release of an oft-bootlegged performance of Davis' ""lost quintet."" His cohorts were Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette and Airto Moreira. Not a bad lineup for a band that never existed, save a few fiery performances in 1969 and 1970. In fact, at the time, the status of Davis' proper quintet (featuring Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams and Shorter) was a little hazy. Williams had left to run his own show with Lifetime, but Hancock and Carter would continue to play with the trumpeter on and off for a couple of years. Also, the issue of the new quintet actually being a sextet added to the confusion of just who, exactly, was a part of Davis' band. One other oddity confronted the lucky few who were able to witness these guys live: almost all the music being played was unreleased, and unlike anything ever produced by jazz musicians. Most of the tunes performed at this Fillmore date (not to be confused with another release, Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East, recorded in June of the same year) were from the landmark Bitches Brew LP. Although Bitches Brew had been recorded the previous summer, it wouldn't be released until a few weeks after this performance. And as any of that album's millions of fans will tell you, its music isn't really the kind that sinks in on the first listen. The Davis Quin/Sextet was opening for Steve Miller and Neil Young for these sets. But if the jazz community was bitterly divided over the notion of Miles Davis playing ""rock"" music, I can only imagine what was going through the heads of people accustomed to hearing ""Cinnamon Girl,"" rather than ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,"" for an encore. Judging by the audience response here, they probably didn't really know what to think. The applause is polite, but hesitant, and the two or three guys who wanted more at the end may have been anomalies, because it was pretty obvious the band had left it all onstage after the last number. To recognize greatness: it is elusive, and most likely, beyond the sensibilities of most hippies and/or mere mortals. The first set begins as Holland, DeJohnette and Corea vamp to a furious funk groove. Heavy bass and some well-placed exotic percussion (supplied by the redoubtable Moreira, whose playing receives the ultimate dis by being labeled ""superfluous"" in the liner notes) kick things off, and by the time Davis enters, the brew is already quite hot. The tune is ""Directions,"" and apparently, it refers to many at once. Miles seems to be aiming straight for the jugular while Holland takes the straight and steady, and when Shorter comes in, he leads DeJohnette and Corea on a path so ridden with turbulence and strife, it derails the entire tune. About five minutes in, it becomes impossible to remember that most of these same musicians had produced something like In a Silent Way, only a year earlier. Afterwards, the band segues into ""Spanish Key,"" one of the more straightforward pieces on Bitches Brew, but here already transformed into a three-headed monster by a band that obviously couldn't sit still on a bet. The three heads in question: a rhythm section which never actually came down from the highs of the previous rave, Davis, who was playing more aggressively and with more muscle than he ever had, and Wayne Shorter, who was playing like he never would again. Of course, he wouldn't, at least with Davis. After this date, Shorter would leave the group to form the seminal fusion outfit Weather Report. When he first performed with Davis in the early 60s, he'd received the rap of being a Coltrane disciple (not a criticism, really), but had always possessed a natural calm that his spiritual mentor would discard in favor of pure expression and, often, fury. On this date, Shorter meets his maker, full of fire and machine gun lines on soprano and tenor sax that had only been hinted at on the great releases by the second Davis Quintet. During the second set, whatever jazz history had not been rewritten got its due and then some. ""Directions"" (it appears twice, since these two discs document both an early and a late show) starts off innocently enough, with a low, humming growl from Holland, but quickly develops into the Apocalypse. There are moments when the music seems to cross over into the avant-garde and free jazz realms, especially whenever Shorter is playing a solo. Reportedly, Davis never considered himself a part of those camps, but it's clear he wasn't afraid to let his band steer the ship in that general direction, so long as they kept the groove alive. Corea brings it down a little with a few choruses of comparatively traditional playing, even if it isn't less intense than the others'. The tune segues into ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down""; very different, far greasier and Fatter (with a capital 'F,' as you can see) than the studio version on Bitches Brew. It could almost pass for hard blues-rock, if not for DeJohnette's relentless cymbal attack and Davis' distorted howling. Here, though, it seems to serve as a kind of breather so the band can rev up for ""Bitches Brew,"" arguably in its finest version anywhere on this CD. It begins with ominous, woozy percussion, and some agitated horn punches from the leader. Then, out of nowhere, everything gets funky. Holland lays down some serious dirty pimp low end, filtered through that infamous ""ring modulation"" to give it the extra ass-mangling quality so desired in serious jazz performance. After a bit, Shorter drops another trip-bop bomb, and then the quiet comes back. Davis takes it out with a few quick, muted jabs, while the beat simmers below. And if I never heard another track by that band again, I'd still rank them alongside Davis' other classic groups. The set ends with a version of ""It's About That Time"" (from In a Silent Way), spliced with something called ""Willie Nelson."" The first part takes the original and applies the underlying aggression of this set to its once peaceful groove. The second half takes the bottom out, and showcases at once the band's penchant for repetitive riffing and complete irreverence towards the way jazz solos were supposed to be played (I'm not sure there's a straight chord progression on the entire record). When the track is over, the audience, who probably weren't sure of what had just happened, offers cautious appreciation via some very polite applause. The emcee announces the group again (Miles never spoke during performances), and there are a couple of calls for an encore. Moreira lets everyone know it's over by blowing his whistle, and I surmise that many of the people there were letting out sighs of relief. There's no way to know if they were aware of the jazz revolution starting right under their noses. Over thirty years later, I'm not sure I understand what the preceding hour-and-a-half was all about, except what I consider exceptional musicians taking exceptional chances. It's undoubtedly pointless trying to reduce music to levels of ""genius,"" so from now on, I'll take whatever those guys had to say without much inclination of trying to put it into words.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2197-live-at-the-fillmore-east-march-7-1970-its-about-that-time/,Columbia,2001.0
460,My Morning Jacket,At Dawn,Rock,7.1,June 5 2001,Christopher Dare,,"There's a sentence in the liner notes for At Dawn that says, ""Thanks to all the people giving us a chance to play our rock n roll in this bleeping buzzing world."" That got me to thinking, sometimes music has to be appreciated in a certain context. I saw My Morning Jacket play a show recently in Washington, D.C. Their twangy sounds seemed out of place that night, packed into a tiny club in an urban area, with car alarms blaring outside. I wanted to be kicked back on a lawn chair, sipping some MGD and wiping at sweat while these guys played from an outdoor bandstand. Something about the setting made it seem a more appropriate venue for bleeping and buzzing than alt-country. I'm glad I can give the band a second chance. Louisville, Kentucky's My Morning Jacket have packed the 74 minutes of this CD with 14 honest, straight up rock songs. Don't be confused by claims from the record label, though, that, ""This is what those Palace-whozits and indie-Americana popniks all wish their albums sounded like."" Most of the pieces have an upbeat, positive attitude, and even the slower folk songs don't attempt tortured Oldham-isms. The first song and title track actually teases with a half-minute of doomed, Palace-esque reverb and slow percussion, but warmth enters with acoustic guitar strumming and frontman Jim James' rich croon. James has a strong, unique voice, and his only fault is that he stretches out each note about as far as possible, and on the highest notes something curdles in the back of his throat and he sounds like Kermit the frog. Here, his lyrics deviate oddly from the rest of his efforts: ""They'll haul you out to the streets/ They'll burn your papers and your empty trash cans/ Beat this thought into your head/ ""All your life is obscene""/ But that's when my knife rises/ Their life ends and my life starts again."" James doesn't address that 'us vs. them' paranoia much-- he's much more the lover type, always singing about his girl. Yeah, the lyrics to ""Lowdown"" have been soaking in the trite barrel too long (""Chancin'/ Glance in/ Sho' nuff mood for romancin'""), but they're as simple as the beautiful delay effect of the pedal steel guitar notes that make this song sound so great. ""The Way That He Sings"" is full of wonder about the way songs and relationships affect us, and it's propelled by a foot-tapping snare and pleasant vocal harmonies between the guys in the band. ""Just Because I Do"" is all about drum crashes, angular guitar lines and harmonica, and shares that uplifting, devil-may-care quality that's the secret to a lot of good country and R&B.; The quieter numbers later on sound more like demos, featuring little more than James' plaintive vocals and careful picking. ""If It Smashes Down"" actually unsettles its innocent opening with a description of ""a really fast, risky ride at the fair."" Any chance of a carnival-like atmosphere is dispelled by his hesitant whimpers and howls. I wish My Morning Jacket had more of these surprises hidden in their plaid sleeves. ""Honest Man"" tries to lasso the ""classic"" Stevie Ray Vaughn blues instrumental but falls short. The solo doesn't quite go nowhere, but it's a path you've been dragged down before. Likewise, James rides the ""Sometimes I walk around town lookin' at faces/ Wonderin' why their bodies go to silly places,"" loner device into the ground. But the hidden instrumental track at the end redeems it all; each note takes on a sense of jumbled autonomy, like the music of Songs: Ohia. If you can, pick up the two-disc version of this album. The second disc is a collection of demos, some of which appear as full songs on At Dawn, and some of which are unreleased. It's not essential, but the feeling of intimacy is unparalleled. There's something about voice and acoustic guitar together that creates the impression of fullness. Maybe it's Trevor hollAnd's rich production. Regardless, My Morning Jacket could be the perfect soundtrack to a summer road trip, or just something you wrap around yourself on the way to work each morning.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5533-at-dawn/,Darla,2001.0
461,Radiohead,Amnesiac,Rock,9.0,June 4 2001,Ryan Schreiber,Founder,"After months of waiting, and several tentative release dates, Amnesiac finally hit store shelves last Tuesday. Since last October, we've been hearing that this album, recorded during the same sessions as last year's wildly experimental Kid A, would serve as a return to the band's mid-90's roots. Now we come to find it was all a lie. Not that it gets me down. As far as I'm concerned, Kid A is Radiohead's defining achievement. A total departure from the conventional rock formats of OK Computer and The Bends, Kid A drew from far more abstract and obscure influences than its predecessors. Whereas previous outings captured echoes of U2 and Pink Floyd, Kid A took what it could use from the Talking Heads, Can, Talk Talk, and modern-day IDM artists, and combined it with Radiohead's irrepressible originality and sparkling, alien production. Whether you liked the end result or not, the fact that they had the balls to challenge mainstream insipidness with such heroic creativity was admirable. That said, Amnesiac is about as close to The Bends as Miss Cleo is to Jamaican. And within the first ten seconds of its opening track, ""Packt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box,"" the band crushes that rumor like a bug in the ground. Sparse, clanging percussion evokes abandoned swingsets. Keyboards whir to sonorous life, humming resonantly. Guitars are curiously marked absent. Production-wise, the track could have nestled cozily alongside Kid A's strangest moments, yet its melody is stunningly more infectious than even that album's height of accessibility, ""Optimistic."" Amidst chattering synths and twisted metal, Thom Yorke casually insists that he's ""a reasonable man,"" and politely intones the album's most quoted lyric: ""Get off my case."" The clattering, confrontational ""Packt"" segues awkwardly into ""Pyramid Song,"" a sweeping piano-and-strings ballad, whose unusual timing is difficult to nail down until Phil Selway's live drums give perspective on the punchdrunk rhythm. Yorke croons some of his most poetic lyrics since ""No Surprises,"" inspired by passages from Herman Hesse's Siddhartha. Amidst swelling orchestration and Satie-esque piano chords, Yorke croons a dream-like scenario in which he's visited by black-eyed angels, and his past and future loves. 4/4 traditionalists will take an immediate liking to the very OK Computer-ish ""Dollars and Cents,"" whose lyrical content is strikingly similar to the anti-government, anti-corporate themes expressed on the 1997 classic. Jonny Greenwood's minimal, warped guitarwork and distant string arrangements float celestially over brother Colin's menacing basslines and Selway's delicate drumming. ""Knives Out"" is another OK Computer-style reverbathon, replete with strummed acoustics, chiming electrics, and a not-too-tasteful rehashing of a prominent guitar line from ""Paranoid Android."" Great melody. However, they've fucking used it before. The song also loses points for containing the line, ""Shove it in your mouth."" Really, Thom. Similarly disappointing is ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors."" Powered by a gritty industrial beat, the song's intentional abstractness, for the first time ever, seems forced and caricatured. Thom's MacinYorke vocal treatments never seemed terribly groundbreaking, and here, the gimmick has gone utterly limp. Yorke's lyrical content is also at its most unchallenging, as he educates us on the many varieties of doors that exist, over oafish, programmed beats worthy of a Cleopatra Records sampler. Elsewhere, ""Hunting Bears"" is a two-minute instrumental clip of aimless guitar noodling that shoots for Neil Young's Dead Man soundtrack but comes off as a cutrate Wish You Were Here outtake. A track like this is meant to segue into a related piece of music; instead, we're flung headfirst into the completely dissimilar ""Like Spinning Plates."" If nothing else, Radiohead have always realized the emotional impact of a stunning album closer, and Amnesiac offers two. Sitting side by side, ""Like Spinning Plates"" and ""Life in a Glasshouse"" are so vastly superior to the album's other tracks that the album's few misteps are easily forgiven. ""Spinning Plates,"" while a much better fit for Kid A, is nonetheless one of Radiohead's most affecting tracks to date. It opens with a digitally simulated ""spinning"" sound, disorienting reversed keyboard, and subtle keyboard pings. The song hits its peak when Yorke's indecipherable backwards vocals unexpectedly revert to traditional forward singing during the mournful climax, ""And this just feels like/ Spinning plates/ My body's floating down a muddy river."" But if ""Like Spinning Plates"" would have been a fitting apex for Kid A, ""Life in a Glasshouse"" is entirely suited to the eclectic Amnesiac. Rather than creating a unique, Frankensteinian amalgamation from fragments of other genres, Radiohead instead target a style of music that hasn't been touched for decades: Edison-era big band. In the process of adapting the archaic jazz sound to polyrhythmic piano chords and rock lyricism, Radiohead touch upon an incredibly unique sound that could potentially inspire an entirely new genre. ""Glasshouse"" is most easily (and most often) likened to a New Orleans funeral dirge-- probably because it's not far off the mark. Largely inspired by Louis Armstrong's ""St James Infirmary,"" this track is the least like the others on Amnesiac, and easily the record's winning moment. When, amidst rueful trombone, tumbling clarinet, and the crushingly emotive trumpet of longtime BBC session musician Humphrey Lyttelton, Yorke insists, ""Of course I'd like to sit around and chat/ Of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat,"" and follows it with a minute of wailing ""only, only, only... there's someone listening in,"" the intensity is indescribable. Despite the heights attained by much of Amnesiac, I prefer Kid A for a number of reasons. Quality aside, the questionable sequencing of Amnesiac does little to hush the argument that the record is merely a thinly veiled b-sides compilation; Kid A played out as a cohesive whole that evoked panic and paranoia as well as surrealism and disorientation. Still, Amnesiac's highlights were undeniably worth the wait, and easily overcome its occasional patchiness. Now if you'll pardon me, I have to go untie DiCrescenzo.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6659-amnesiac/,Capitol,2001.0
462,Gorillaz,Gorillaz,"Electronic,Rock",7.0,May 31 2001,Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,"Somewhere in England, or maybe Iceland, Graham Coxon is crying. Blur recently announced that their hiatus will continue through the year's end, due to Damon Albarn's collaboration with Norman Cook. To make matter worse, another Albarn side project, Gorillaz, has already hit stores on both sides of the Atlantic. The novelty group finds Albarn assuming the role of 2-D, the animated lead singer of a pack of four misfits, whose likeness was envisioned by Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett. The Automator-produced ""act"" is a smarmy, promotional gimmick. And it's the best Blur offshoot released to date. As soon as the record begins, the cartoon faÃ§ade fades. Even people who only know Blur as ""that band who did 'Woo-Hoo'"" will immediately detect Albarn's ever-so-Brit pipes. Early reports suggested that Albarn contributed to only a few songs, but he could rightfully be called the band's frontman; his croon can be heard on all but 4 of the album's 16 tracks. Dan ""The Automator"" Nakamura is similarly recognizable. There's no band (animated or otherwise) making this music; it's the Automator throwing down beats, manipulating samples, and letting Kid Koala's scratches interrupt his flow. And that, friends, is why Gorillaz is a conceptual failure. But maybe this is for the best. Nakamura's refreshing production doesn't rely on today's hip-hop skitters and squiggles for its futurism. No, what we've got here is the same brooding backpacker hip-hop that elevated the similar Deltron 3030 LP to unforeseen heights. As a result, this record reveals itself as far less disposable than its cartoon cover art suggests. Gorillaz's best tracks exploit the unlikely, but successful dynamic between Albarn and Nakamura. On ""Man Research (Clapper)"", Damon wails hysterically over Dan's relentless, echoing thump. ""New Genious (Brother)"" is gloomy trip-hop with orchestral flourishes that wrap around the flux of Albarn's falsetto. On ""Clint Eastwood"", Del tha Funkee Homosapien handles the song's verses, allowing Damon a small cameo in the looped chorus. And curiously, I can think of few other samples that would compliment Del's urgent delivery as effectively as Albarn's laconic vocal haze. The album's foray into dub-lite, ""Slow Country"", is Gorillaz's charming peak. A light, Latin-tinged piano playfully slides over a sunny groove while Albarn exhibits ""Tender""-like plaintiveness with lines like, ""I can't stand your loneliness."" Despite the fact that this track is unfamiliar territory for both Nakamura and Albarn, their charismatic playfulness makes for undeniable fun. The small-scale experimentation, though, falls flat on the record's few rock tracks. The appropriately titled ""Re-Hash"" is such a generic marriage of acoustic pop and stock hip-hop beats that, were Albarn to come in chanting, ""Come, m'lady, come, come m'lady,"" it would hardly strike as surprising. The Wire reject, ""Punk"", suffers from an asinine formula (play a sloppy riff, clap three times, add cockney vocals, repeat) that makes each of the track's 90 seconds harrowing. That Gorillaz's closing number-- Ed Case's two-step-meets-raga remix of ""Clint Eastwood""-- doesn't feel out of place could be taken as testament to how successfully eclectic the album is. But in actuality, it's a sign of the record's short-lasting, faddish appeal. Gorillaz is the definitive side-project: Even at its best, it's never more than a divergent one-off stint. Albarn may occasionally succeed on non-Blur outings, but as with Coxon and Alex James' solo affairs, they only further prove that Blur is equal to much more than the sum of its parts.

463,Depeche Mode,Exciter,"Electronic,Rock",5.5,May 15 2001,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Fashion is one of those things I'll just never understand. From Old Navy revisions of 70's clothing fads to icy, haute couture boutiques in upscale malls pushing $800 Chanel pocketbooks, it all seems a bit pointless; our culture's rabid materialism and hunger for the next big thing ensures style shifts every several months. Depeche Mode are no strangers to fashion-- it's in their name. Over the course of 14 albums, they've often favored style over substance, occasionally stopping to strike an emotional chord along the way. But no one could accuse them of changing with musical fads and trends. If anything, they've remained more consistent in twenty years than almost any of their contemporaries. And now, in the age of the beat, they've even toned down the dance rhythms that powered their earlier work in favor of a more abstract direction, albeit one that still screams Depeche Mode. It's taken Martin Gore, Dave Gahan, and Andrew Fletcher four years to follow up 1997's Ultra, but even with BjÃ¶rk producer Mark Bell on board, calling their new opus Exciter is kind of overstating it. From a production standpoint, the record sounds great, but at its core, it comes up empty, lacking a solid foundation of good songs to rest its adventurous studio trickery upon. Longtime fans will still find a lot to like here: ""Dream On"" tempers rolling acoustic guitars with a bed of twitching, programmed beats and fractured synth samples, and Dave Gahan's rich, unaffected vocals. Even with a new sonic direction, the song feels like classic Depeche Mode, and would sit nicely alongside most of the material on their greatest hits compilations. ""I Am You"" is another standout, diving headlong into uncharted territory with some truly bizarre, high-pitched synth squeals surfacing in the chorus. This background serves to unsettle an otherwise comfortable environment, and its juxtaposition of beauty and ugliness is in tune with the Rephlex aesthetic. Mark Bell's deft touch lends every moment of Exciter a certain glow of invention, but it's not all brilliant by any means. Every pretty girl gets something stuck in her teeth eventually, and these lyrics are a giant hunk of dark green spinach wedged between the incisors. The boys heap on enough lyrical dross to kill a high school goth. To view some of the most egregious offenses, let's briefly visit the Martin GORE Shop of Lyrical Horrors: From ""Shine"": ""Put on your blindfold and a dress that's tight/ And come with me on a mystery night.../ Somebody has to shine for me/ It's difficult not to shine for me."" >From ""The Dead of Night"": ""We're the horniest boys/ With the corniest ploys/ Who take the easiest girls/ To our sleaziest worlds.../ We are the dead of night/ We're in the zombie room/ We're twilight's parasites/ With self-inflicted wounds."" From ""Freelove"": ""Hey girl/ You've got to take this moment/ Then let it slip away/ Let go of complicated feelings/ There's no price to pay.../ And I'm only here/ To bring you free love/ Let's make it clear/ That this is free love."" A visit like this could last a lot longer, but it would probably get pretty dull. Unfortunately, boredom is a prevailing mood when listening to the whole of Exciter. The first few times through, it's hard to stay invested past the fifth track, ""The Dead of Night."" The two instrumental interludes, ""Lovetheme"" and ""Easy Tiger,"" are both rather unnecessary padding, and ""Breathe,"" with its string of Biblical references, simply plods. ""I Feel Loved"" is the only track that appears to be aimed toward a dancefloor, though it plays more like the 5:00am comedown song the DJ spins to get you to leave. The somewhat conventional ballad ""Goodnight Lovers"" brings the album to a reasonably engaging close with its warm synth patches and familiar chord progressions, but its lyrics concerning ""soul sisters and soul brothers"" feel forced. Depeche Mode and Mark Bell deserve a lot of credit for constructing the album's sounds from scratch, avoiding factory presets and rarely using the same sound combinations twice. The band should also be lauded for sticking to their guns after twenty years of falling in and out of fashion. But despite the amazing range of sounds they've conjured, Exciter ultimately fails to interest. Too much of it drifts by unnoticed, and the songs themselves often form around a vacuous core of trite lyrical conceits. It's the most frustrating type of album there is-- one that's full of promise and shining moments, but never fully delivers. Add to this the fact that those shining moments stand out like volcanoes in Nebraska, and you get something that the fans should own, and the neophytes should steer clear of.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2283-exciter/,Warner Bros.,2001.0
464,The Beach Boys,Smiley Smile,Rock,9.5,March 29 2001,Spencer Owen,,"In the mid-60's, Brian Wilson declared a race to the next major development in record production techniques. Everything looked good in Wilson's Beach Boys camp. He'd just produced one of the most revolutionary albums pop music had yet seen with 1966's Pet Sounds, and the reports of the follow-up, Smile, were extremely promising. ""Our new album will be better than Pet Sounds,"" he pledged. ""It will be as much an improvement over Sounds as that was over Summer Days."" One can only imagine how great an improvement that must have originally been, and how exhilarating it would have been to look forward to such a dramatic shift occurring again after such a short period of time. So who were his worthy competitors? Well, there were the Beatles, and then... well, really, that was all. Always the tough competitors, the Beatles were the group with Rubber Soul, the album that inspired Wilson to create Pet Sounds in the first place. He respected and admired them, and felt he could beat them to a pulp. And with Smile set for release in late '66, Wilson felt that he had the race ""in the bag."" That is, until December of 1966, at which time label disputes and tension within the group had reached such a level that Wilson forced himself to abandon the Smile project as he had envisioned it. To fulfill contractual obligations, the Beach Boys recorded Smiley Smile in the first three quarters of 1967. The hype died, the album failed, Sgt Pepper came out, and Wilson began a quick descent into madness. He stopped taking sole production credits, and lost all confidence, fully aware that, without the possibility of Smile ever being completed, he could never top Sgt. Pepper. It's truly a shame that Smile failed the way it did. And like any modern everyday thief in the age of Napster, I've been afforded the opportunity to hear the Smile recordings, or at least what's out there, unfinished, with an ""unofficial"" tracklist. It's hard to imagine how it would have sounded if completely finished; as it stands, however, it sounds like the beginning of something that could have changed popular music history. Perhaps we wouldn't be so monotheistic in our pop leanings, worshipping only at the Beatles' altar the way some do today. With the Smile material, full of vignettes, lush harmonies, unique arrangements and some of the most gorgeous of melodies, Brian Wilson proved that he was a man of virtually limitless genius. So now that the history business is out of the way, let's talk about what the Boys and Capitol Records chose to release in lieu of Smile. Smiley Smile is a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of Smile's existence, this album could have been a contemporary classic. Remnants of the vignette style are still there, along with a sense of humor both musical and lyrical. Group harmonies shine just as beautifully as any on Pet Sounds, and although the album isn't anywhere close to the sonic revolution that Sgt. Pepper had already brought, Wilson's innovative production and arrangements still bring out the best in every single track. And one of his best melodies can be found in ""Wonderful,"" matching, if not topping, anything on Pet Sounds. As someone who's heard the Smile sessions, I find many moments sorely missing, of course; if I had to choose, the most notable exclusion is the lounge-psychedelic mini-epic ""Cabin Essence."" And the songs that do appear from Smile are pretty radically reworked, with the exception of ""Good Vibrations,"" already a #1 single from '66, which can be found in its final and perfect form here. Strangely enough, the most disappointing re-recording is of ""Wonderful""; standing on its own, the Smiley Smile version is gorgeous enough, but it nearly pales in comparison to the stripped-down harpsichord and heartbreaking harmonies of the original. As for bonus tracks or outtakes included here, the centerpieces are those culled from the ""Good Vibrations"" sessions. There are some takes from the original recording sessions, in which we're given a fascinating glimpse of Wilson's way in the studio; he directed most of the players live, as if he were conducting minor symphonies in pop music. Also included is an early alternate version with different lyrics and even a slightly differing melody, which, while interesting to compare to the final version, just doesn't fully succeed. ""Heroes and Villains"" also appears in two forms. As Smiley Smile's opener, it remains a multi-part, multi-layered, harmonious pop single, true to the form of Wilson at his peak. Luckily, Van Dyke Parks collaborated on the lyrics as he did for much of Smile, ensuring a poetic success rather than a hit-or-miss Wilson affair, since Brian's lyrics tended to miss more often than not. As a bonus track, it appears the way it may have been originally premiered on Smile, with even more random sections, unpredictable twists and vocal samples. Surprisingly, the re-recorded ""Heroes"" works even better; rather than relying on twists and turns, it's based more on the voices of the gorgeous ""psychedelic barbershop quartet,"" as Jimi Hendrix once referred to it. Indeed, Capitol were smart to include 1968's Wild Honey on the disc as part of their two-for-one Beach Boys re-release series. But when comparing it to such an album as the one preceding it here, it barely deserves a paragraph. One or two of its tracks succeed, mostly when it's either a classic bittersweet Wilson melody (""I'd Love Just Once to See You"") or a throwback to 50's dance-pop (""How She Boogalooed It""). And naturally, the production still sounded good as long as Brian was at least in the studio. The rest of the record is in the R&B; vein as interpreted by white surfer boys-- Beach Boys, even. There's also a Stevie Wonder cover sung with as much faux-soul as Carl Wilson could have possibly mustered. It's not pretty, and, to be blunt, neither is the majority of Wild Honey. Back to 1967, on the day the Beach Boys recorded the bare and light-hearted ""Vegetables,"" another track written for Smile: Paul McCartney decided to drop by the studio. He can be heard chewing vegetables for the track's only percussion. And, as Al Jardine recalls, McCartney and Wilson could be seen together behind the console at one point, and McCartney even ventured to play Wilson the just-finished ""A Day in the Life"" before Sgt Pepper was even released. While a supposedly ""burned-out"" genius was creating the most simplistic recording he'd made in years, he became a first-hand witness to the popular sonic revolution that he could have been. In the public eye, the Beatles were the clear victors, and the people simply weren't satisfied with second place. Now, with Smiley Smile finally reissued in America after years of out-of-print status, hopefully people will begin to analyze the whole race again. In my mind, it was a photo finish.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11667-smiley-smilewild-honey/,"Capitol,Capitol",2001.0
465,Radiohead,Kid A,Rock,10.0,October 2 2000,Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,"I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. Radiohead were hunched over their instruments. Thom Yorke slowly beat on a grand piano, singing, eyes closed, into his microphone like he was trying to kiss around a big nose. Colin Greenwood tapped patiently on a double bass, waiting for his cue. White pearls of arena light swam over their faces. A lazy disco light spilled artificial constellations inside the aluminum cove of the makeshift stage. The metal skeleton of the stage ate one end of Florence's Piazza Santa Croce, on the steps of the Santa Croce Cathedral. Michelangelo's bones and cobblestone laid beneath. I stared entranced, soaking in Radiohead's new material, chiseling each sound into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only sound system for the material for months. The butterscotch lamps along the walls of the tight city square bled upward into the cobalt sky, which seemed as strikingly artificial and perfect as a wizard's cap. The staccato piano chords ascended repeatedly. ""Black eyed angels swam at me,"" Yorke sang like his dying words. ""There was nothing to fear, nothing to hide."" The trained critical part of me marked the similarity to Coltrane's ""Ole."" The human part of me wept in awe. The Italians surrounding me held their breath in communion (save for the drunken few shouting ""Criep!""). Suddenly, a rise of whistles and orgasmic cries swept unfittingly through the crowd. The song, ""Egyptian Song,"" was certainly momentous, but wasn't the response more apt for, well, ""Creep?"" I looked up. I thought it was fireworks. A teardrop of fire shot from space and disappeared behind the church where the syrupy River Arno crawled. Radiohead had the heavens on their side. For further testament, Chip Chanko and I both suffered auto-debilitating accidents in the same week, in different parts of the country, while blasting ""Airbag"" in our respective Japanese imports. For months, I feared playing the song about car crashes in my car, just as I'd feared passing 18- wheelers after nearly being crushed by one in 1990. With good reason, I suspect Radiohead to possess incomprehensible powers. The evidence is only compounded with Kid A-- the rubber match in the band's legacy-- an album which completely obliterates how albums, and Radiohead themselves, will be considered. Even the heralded OK Computer has been nudged down one spot in Valhalla. Kid A makes rock and roll childish. Considerations on its merits as ""rock"" (i.e. its radio fodder potential, its guitar riffs, and its hooks) are pointless. Comparing this to other albums is like comparing an aquarium to blue construction paper. And not because it's jazz or fusion or ambient or electronic. Classifications don't come to mind once deep inside this expansive, hypnotic world. Ransom, the philologist hero of C.S. Lewis' Out of the Silent Planet who is kidnapped and taken to another planet, initially finds his scholarship useless in his new surroundings, and just tries to survive the beautiful new world. This is an emotional, psychological experience. Kid A sounds like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a band, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Radiohead hated being Radiohead, but ended up with the most ideal, natural Radiohead record yet. ""Everything in Its Right Place"" opens like Close Encounters spaceships communicating with pipe organs. As your ears decide whether the tones are coming or going, Thom Yorke's Cuisinarted voice struggles for its tongue. ""Everything,"" Yorke belts in uplifting sighs. The first-person mantra of ""There are two colors in my head"" is repeated until the line between Yorke's mind and the listener's mind is erased. Skittering toy boxes open the album's title song, which, like the track ""Idioteque,"" shows a heavy Warp Records influence. The vocoder lullaby lulls you deceivingly before the riotous ""National Anthem."" Mean, fuzzy bass shapes the spine as unnerving theremin choirs limn. Brash brass bursts from above like Terry Gilliam's animated foot. The horns swarm as Yorke screams, begs, ""Turn it off!"" It's the album's shrill peak, but just one of the incessant goosebumps raisers. After the rockets exhaust, Radiohead float in their lone orbit. ""How to Disappear Completely"" boils down ""Let Down"" and ""Karma Police"" to their spectral essence. The string-laden ballad comes closest to bridging Yorke's lyrical sentiment to the instrumental effect. ""I float down the Liffey/ I'm not here/ This isn't happening,"" he sings in his trademark falsetto. The strings melt and weep as the album shifts into its underwater mode. ""Treefingers,"" an ambient soundscape similar in sound and intent to Side B of Bowie and Eno's Low, calms after the record's emotionally strenuous first half. The primal, brooding guitar attack of ""Optimistic"" stomps like mating Tyrannosaurs. The lyrics seemingly taunt, ""Try the best you can/ Try the best you can,"" before revealing the more resigned sentiment, ""The best you can is good enough."" For an album reportedly ""lacking"" in traditional Radiohead moments, this is the best summation of their former strengths. The track erodes into a light jam before morphing into ""In Limbo."" ""I'm lost at sea,"" Yorke cries over clean, uneasy arpeggios. The ending flares with tractor beams as Yorke is vacuumed into nothingness. The aforementioned ""Idioteque"" clicks and thuds like Aphex Twin and Bjork's Homogenic, revealing brilliant new frontiers for the ""band."" For all the noise to this point, it's uncertain entirely who or what has created the music. There are rarely traditional arrangements in the ambiguous origin. This is part of the unique thrill of experiencing Kid A. Pulsing organs and a stuttering snare delicately propel ""Morning Bell."" Yorke's breath can be heard frosting over the rainy, gray jam. Words accumulate and stick in his mouth like eye crust. ""Walking walking walking walking,"" he mumbles while Jonny Greenwood squirts whale-chant feedback from his guitar. The closing ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" brings to mind The White Album, as it somehow combines the sentiment of Lennon's LP1 closer-- the ode to his dead mother, ""Julia""-- with Ringo and Paul's maudlin, yet sincere LP2 finale, ""Goodnight."" Pump organ and harp flutter as Yorke condones with affection, ""I think you're crazy."" To further emphasize your feeling at that moment and the album's overall theme, Yorke bows out with ""I will see you in the next life."" If you're not already there with him. The experience and emotions tied to listening to Kid A are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's an album of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet 48 minutes. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior albums clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men (Nigel Godrich included) created this, it's clear that Radiohead must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this record! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/,Capitol,2000.0
466,Johnny Cash,American III: Solitary Man,Folk/Country,8.6,September 30 2000,Ryan Kearney,,"We're constantly bombarded by noise. Especially for those of us who live in city, there's no escaping it; the noise of dense humanity has become a part of our lives. We accept and ignore it just to survive. But sometimes the noise becomes so overwhelming that the brain can no longer shut it out. That's when we do one of two things: lose ourselves, or lose our geography. Earlier in the day on which I wrote this, I woke up to a busy hammer just ten inches from my head, flooding through the porous plaster wall. I swore at someone whose face I'd never seen. Then, the alarm clock joined in, providing a grating beat that lasted all day, accompanied at times by the horn blasts of sedate cabdrivers, the parade of victors and their drunk fans, and the deafening screech of the old red 6 train. The noise got so loud as to erase my memory of it having never existed. Isn't it amazing, then, that I arrive home only to subject myself to more noise: music that to virgin ears would sound like a drowning robot or a greenhouse explosion? Yes, and understandable, too: the heightened stimulus threshold must be met. But just as silence makes clearer the urban noise I live through, so too does listening to Johnny Cash expose my mostly stentorian music collection. Like 1994's American Recordings and 1996's Unchained, American III was produced by Rick Rubin and includes covers of well-known and lesser-known songs. On the opening number, for instance, Cash boils down Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" to its essence, employing just two guitars and a barely audible organ. The only important instrument here, though, is Cash's voice. As deep and heavy as a mudslide, it raises the dead, the lonely, and the heartbroken. What makes this not just a covers album is that, as Cash explains in the record's liner notes, he makes the songs feel like his own. Sure, Petty wrote it, but its hard to deny that, ""You can stand me up at the gates of hell/ But I won't back down,"" is a quintessential Cash sentiment. They're not his words, but they are. Call it a vocal strongarm. And he does this again and again, from Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" to Egbert Williams' ""Nobody"", from David Allen Coe's ""Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)"" to U2's ""One"". But American III's high point is its two-song centerpiece. The first is Will Oldham's ""I See a Darkness"", on which it becomes clear that, perhaps because of his neurological disorder, Cash's voice isn't as sure and strong as it once was. When he quavers, with Oldham singing backup, ""Is there hope that somehow you can save me from this darkness?"" the effect is absolutely devastating. You won't listen to the song the same after this. The shivers will eventually leave your spine, but the residue remains. That song's transcendent power also stems from its production, which, although still sparse, is relatively lush. The organ and piano that rise to match the guitar remain in use for Nick Cave's ""The Mercy Seat"". Chronicling the first-person thoughts of a man being executed, this song, more than any other on the album, was written for Cash. Building to a rumbling crescendo, he belts out, ""And the mercy seat is smokin'/ And I think my head is meltin'."" This would've brought even Gary Gilmore to tears. The second half of the album features mostly original compositions. Sparse like the early tracks, ""Field of Diamonds"", ""Before My Time"", ""Country Trash"", and ""I'm Leavin' Now"" prove that Cash hasn't lost his songwriting step, and they show why he can temporarily lay claim to other artist's songs. While some critics take issue with Rubin's underproduction, none of the songs on American III require ornate instrumentation. Whether they've been fluffed up or stripped raw, at the core of each is a compelling statement from one of our greatest humanists. I keep telling people that I'm going to leave the city and move westward to the country or the mountains. I've done it before, and did so with enough success that I didn't concurrently sentimentalize the journey in an effort to reduce cognitive dissonance.

467,The Beach Boys,15 Big Ones,Rock,1.5,August 15 2000,D. Erik Kempke,,"Every Beach Boys album made in the 1970s was a comeback attempt. In the face of dwindling commercial returns, the group struggled earnestly in the first part of the decade to define itself outside the shadow of Brian Wilson. These attempts were abandoned after the success of 1974's greatest hits collection, Endless Summer, which established the group as the world's most successful oldies act. 1976 found the group attempting to maintain its revived fortunes in the recording studio as well as on the concert stage. While many of the other recent Beach Boys ""twofer"" releases contained music of similar tenor and approach, these two albums, issued during the most conflicted time period in the band's history, are immediately striking in their dissimilarity. For these albums, one of the most crass marketing ploys in a group history dominated by crass marketing ploys was devised: the return of full control of the group to once-great bandleader Brian. Unfortunately, Wilson had spent most of the '70s descending into an abyss of paranoia, addiction, and obesity. He hadn't been in charge of a Beach Boys session since 1966, and that the group sought in 1976 to restore Wilson to the control that they had fought to wrest from him 10 years earlier is painfully ironic. Given Brian Wilson's fragile state, it's difficult to understand what the group expected to achieve through this arrangement. The result of these sessions, 1976's 15 Big Ones, is a wreck of an album. The production is muddy and confused, the material largely comprised of uninspired covers and outtakes from earlier albums. ""Susie Cincinatti"" was a 1970 b-side. The group's covers of standards like ""Chapel of Love"" and ""In the Still of the Night"" are notable only for the morbid fascination they hold (the vocals on the former are truly cringe-inducing). Brian's once-sweet falsetto is reduced to a hoarse crackle; as a result, Mike Love's painful nasal whine is the dominant voice on the record. Only a few cuts stand out from the mess. Of the originals, ""Had to Phone Ya"" and ""Back Home""-- both of which are based on songs first written in the early 1960s-- are the best. Only those cuts, along with a truly inspired version of the Righteous Brothers' Spector-produced classic ""Just Once in My Life"" (actually benefiting from Wilson's raw vocals) save the album from being completely unlistenable. Strangely, 15 Big Ones was a huge hit upon its initial release, but to say that it hasn't stood the test of time is an understatement. After the tour for that record, Brian Wilson planned a solo release, but the group quickly latched onto the project in an attempt to maintain their momentum. The product, The Beach Boys Love You, is totally Brian's, and is the last album produced under the group's name to be written and produced solely by him. It's nothing if not idiosyncratic, and sounds like literally no other Beach Boys album from any period. The record is dominated by Wilson's newfound infatuation with the Moog synthesizer, and his hoarse but heartfelt vocals. There are a couple throwaways-- the early '70s outtake ""Good Time,"" and the inscrutable Roger McGuinn co-write ""Ding Dang""-- but for the most part, Brian's songwriting and arranging talents are intact and in full force. The format of the album recalls Wilson's first truly memorable LP, The Beach Boys Today, by placing uptempo, upbeat numbers on Side One, and a suite of slower, romantic songs on Side Two. The lyrics here tend toward the childlike (""If Mars had life on it/ I might find my wife on it"") to the simply bizarre (""Johnny Carson's a real live wire""). It's the ballads in the album's second half that elevate it to the level of a great Beach Boys album. ""The Night Was So Young,"" with its beautiful harmonies, sounds like it could have been a Pet Sounds outtake, were it not for the bleating synths. ""Let's Put Our Hearts Together"" features a duet with Wilson's then-wife, Marilyn Rovell. This is Wilson's most personal set of songs, and he weaves a shimmering web of sound on them, his vocals as strong as they ever were. The Beach Boys Love You stands in sharp contrast to the albums that preceded and followed it, because it was a product of genuine inspiration on Brian Wilson's part, with little outside interference. Soon after its release, both Brian and the Beach Boys resumed their separate downward trajectories: the group into mediocrity, disco mixes, and obscurity, and Brian back into addiction and mental instability. That Brian Wilson has, in recent years, reclaimed some small measure of his sanity and now performs regularly, presiding over his rich legacy, can be considered a small miracle. Still, one can't help but regret that he has never again created music as original and individualistic as presented on this release in the ensuing years. It's a credit to the Beach Boys that for one brief, final moment, they allowed Brian Wilson the freedom to create the music he wanted, and the resulting album is, like its creator, frazzled, delicate, and beautiful in its sentiment.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11669-15-big-oneslove-you/,"Capitol,Capitol",2000.0
468,The Beach Boys,Sunflower/Surf's Up,Rock,8.9,July 18 2000,Hefner Macauley,,"Let's do this. It's the summertime, and we're coming off of a decade-long re-evaluation of the Beach Boys' legacy. It just doesn't stop. If you thought it began and ended with Pet Sounds, keep thinking, buddy. The long out-of-print Beach Boys albums of the '70s have finally been salvaged and remastered by Capitol from the dregs of the Reprise/Brother catalog. Without question, the resurrection of the Beach Boys in a vibrant critical and commercial capacity was a significant retrospective development of music in the '90s. Pet Sounds becomes, now that we think about it, arguably the greatest pop production ever; a box set commemorating the album and the group's legacy are released and uniformly lauded; pop groups everywhere shamelessly draw inspiration from the acid-tinged barbershop quartet arrangements; a handicapped Brian Wilson even manages to release something of a comeback. With this extensive overhaul, it's right to expect some chafe only zealots with fat wallets could feel compelled to purchase. But such is not the case with this particular release, which pairs up the two first and best artifacts of the slow, golden sunset of the Beach Boys' decline. Sunflower marked a fresh start for the band as they left Capitol and established their own label with Reprise, eager to capitalize on the arrangement and recapture an audience that had deserted them. Perhaps the strongest album they released post-Pet Sounds, the group dynamic (no longer as Brian Wilson-focused) reinvigorated the production and songwriting remarkably. The thematic and lyrical content is suitably eccentric and cheesy at times, but that element is as much a part of the work of the Beach Boys as musical innovation. Dennis Wilson demonstrates impressive songwriting range from rockers ""Slip On Through"" and ""It's About Time"" to beaut-ballad ""Forever"" and the oddity ""Got to Know the Woman,"" where his lasciviousness gets a bit unruly. Brian Wilson hadn't become completely marginalized at this point, however. He still makes most of the songwriting contributions here, standouts of which are the proto-shoegazer ""All I Wanna Do,"" the driving ""This Whole World,"" and ""Add Some Music to Your Day,"" which manages to sound nothing like Fugazi but whose sentiment is the most punk-rock the group recorded. But despite Sunflower's merits and critical acclaim, it was not a financial success, which didn't bode well as the inauguration of the Beach Boys' brand new era. Some say out of strife and tension comes the best music, and while this doesn't apply to the band's follow-up, Surf's Up, at least it can be said that they got one last good record in there before they really started sucking. Surf's Up's cover art says all that needs to be said about the mood: painted in mournful blues and greens, a Don Quixote-like figure slouches heavily on an emaciated horse. Underscoring the irony of the title, Endless Summer this is not. The most interesting moments of musical texture are provided by an occasional use of synthesizers. Content-wise, the album ostensibly addresses pressing environmental, social and health concerns, but songs like ""Don't Go Near the Water"" and ""Lookin' at Tomorrow (A Welfare Song)"" are as much a reflection upon the group's fortunes as they are upon the world's. Most touching about the album is Brian Wilson's suite-like three-song contribution as the album's closing, clearly influenced by Paul McCartney's suite on Abbey Road. By now truly marginalized, the first two tracks document his resignation to fall away. ""A Day in the Life of a Tree"" opens with the lines, ""Feel the wind burn through my skin/ The pain, the air is killing me,"" and on the organ driven ""Til I Die,"" he laments being ""a cork on the ocean/ Floating over the raging sea."" The magnificent title cut closes the album, a track salvaged from the legendary aborted Smile sessions. ""Surf's Up"" was intended as the ""A Day in the Life"" of the classic album that wasn't, and here it shines through in all its glory, from Van Dyke Parks' skewed lyricism to the celestial ""child is father to the man"" coda. It's likely to be the best reissued track you hear all year.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/,"Capitol,Capitol",
469,Pink Floyd,Animals,Rock,10.0,April 25 2000,James P. Wisdom,,"It begins somewhere for everyone. There's the first song that grabs your attention and seizes the imagination, the first album that demonstrates such overall strength and originality that it becomes something more for most listeners, just as there is the first kiss that awakens the soul and forever changes the vision. I admit without qualm that it began for me with Animals. My brother was in college, and one day I went through his records and listened to the ones with the coolest covers. Animals fascinated me then as it still fascinates me today. It is the acute anthropomorphic fantasy, possessing a timeless quality that has thrust it into the category of ""classic,"" though it may remain forever in the shadow of its more commercially successful older brother, Dark Side Of The Moon. Consisting of three tracks each longer than ten minutes and two tracks under two minutes, Animals is not for the attention- span- deficient. However, within this impenetrable fortress of radio- unfriendly tracks, we hear Dave Gilmour's guitars at their absolute best, get a full-on dose of Roger Waters' powerful lyrical imagery, and are presented with the worst elements of our own humanity- packaged in the skins of ""Sheep,"" ""Dogs"" and ""Pigs (Three Different Ones)"". For those weaned on The Wall and Dark Side, you'll find Animals to be a whole new bag of feed. Where Floyd's two most recognizable albums made their mark with operatic aggression and fear, Animals deals in dirt- under- the- fingernails reality, the common smallness that simultaneously binds and repels us all. ""Dogs,"" a 17-minute study in the commonest of all faults, lazily dispenses bite after venomous bite into the desires that drive us to seize the fast buck and screw anyone that gets in our way: You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,
So that when they turn their backs on you,
You'll get the chance to put the knife in. All this wrapped up in the flaky coating of two hauntingly similar and musically identical tracks casting opposite views of cynicism and hope on the proceedings. Animals is like George Orwell's Animal Farm run through a full- audio acid test- spectacular in every aspect and now in full color. I admit without qualm that it began for me with Animals.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6307-animals/,"Columbia,Columbia",
470,Steely Dan,Two Against Nature,Rock,1.6,February 29 2000,Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,"If you are a die-hard Steely Dan fan from ""back in the day,"" let me first congratulate you on figuring out how this whole ""Internet"" thing works. The computer commercials promise plug-in-and-surf, but there's always a glitch. At work you're too embarrassed to ask the young tech guys how the ""web"" works. They'd snicker before cranking The Fragile back up and turning back to their monitors. Never show inferiority to subordinates. So, you pony-tailed Jeep-drivers and terrier-walkers, I'm crawling inside your minds like ""Reeling in the Years"" did so many decades ago. I know you've held silly suspicions, if just for a moment, that your ponytail was perhaps pulling back your hairline. I know that this review might hurt your feelings. Here, play with this shiny silver Nokia while I chat with somebody else. If you're a regular Pitchfork reader... why are you even curious about Steely Dan in 2000?! Only their 20 year absence gives them any press or assumed credibility. Unlike Chicago, Rush, or Cheap Trick they did not slip down a steep staircase of increasingly prosaic Prozac records. Steely Dan dodged the 80's and they didn't make a Woke Up with the Monster. One can imagine the hype Rush would receive in 2000 if they'd jumped 20 years from 1981's Moving Pictures straight to Test for Echo. This would not make Test for Echo a desirable album. For those worth risking it, extended absence makes for great publicity. Some of the smoothest objects know to humankind include the buttock of a baby, the belly of an otter, Downy-laden terrycloth, Palmolive, and rose petals. Add to that list Two Against Nature. The lengthy, indistinguishable tracks could pass for a Daniel Lanois-produced collaboration between the Dave Matthews Band and Kenny G. This putrid bait lures both the smooth jazz aficionados and the hackysackers. ""Fusion"" is too caustic a verb, better suited for nuclear physics and Don Caballero. ""Making pudding"" better describes this genre blending. ""Jamming"" sax solos glide over neutered, bassless funk. Glass guitar and percussion clink along steadily like a chorus of jangling Tag Heuers, automatic Lexus locks, popping Le Croix cans, clicking laptop covers, crystal Cristal toasts, and smacking Hollywood cheek-kisses. The same slow-bop pace is rigorously maintained. Vocals exhale so innocuously you have to hold a mirror up under the speaker to make sure it's alive. The credits list 13 producers (!) who tackle tasks such as ""editing,"" ""horn arranger,"" ""consultant,"" ""project manager,"" and-- most tellingly-- ""copyist."" This is less music than ""production."" 23 musicians took part in this album's design, four of which simply played ""snare."" At least at the end of ""Wild Wild West"" Will Smith destroys the giant, evil machine. Music is more than craft and technique. Steely Dan's seams are hidden, the instruments are digitally lacquered, and the edges are buffed. 20 years have passed since Gaucho and Steely Dan seem content to completely ignore them. Amazingly, Steely Dan's name has been popping up as a hip musical crush. Remember, this glossy bop-pop was the indifferent aristocracy to punk rock's stone-throwing in the late 70's. People fought and died so our generation could listen to something better. Okay, so they died of overdoses and car crashes. They still had soul. Keep up the good fight. Put down this sports-utility vehicle of a record.

471,The Roots,The Roots Come Alive,Rap,5.7,January 31 2000,Taylor M. Clark,,"On a stormy eve in recent history, the legendary Roots crew deigned to pay a visit to the illustrious educational institution that I attend, which happens to be overwhelmingly white. The Roots, if you didn't know, are overwhelmingly black, which made for quite an interesting evening. 'Fork editor Ryan had sent me The Roots Come Alive for review, so I felt it my duty as a critic to pay far too much cash in order to bear witness to this live music phenomenon. And what a spectacle it was. As the seething throng of white bodies lurched quasi-rhythmically to the abundance of soul presented on stage, I began to wonder if The Roots really felt compelled to try very hard to impress the crowd. I would imagine that this is something of a burning question for The Roots, who play a massive 250 shows each year. They could be doing crossword puzzles up there while halfheartedly rapping, and the vast majority of the crowd would still be jumping around madly. This particular crowd was so thoroughly unfunky that when Black Thought thrust the mic toward the crowd for an exhaustively planned and explained ""rock, rock on"" for the tenth time, the crowd still seemed genuinely surprised and temporarily stunned. So something just seems fundamentally askew when, for example, Black Thought busts out with a ""y'all wit' me, Switzerland?"" after an ill groove on The Roots Come Alive. Grandmaster Flash would roll over in his grave, and he's not even dead yet. Regardless, The Roots' devastatingly funky show is represented pretty accurately on The Roots Come Alive. The problem with this record is that the group is fairly rugged and raw, replete with their live instrumentation, on their proper LPs. Thus, a live album by The Roots adds very little beyond crowd noise and many extra ""y'know what I'm sayin'""s. The songs are more or less faithfully recreated, with highlights being the creative beatboxing and vocal scratching that are absent from the originals. Black Thought continues to be one of the most intelligent and skilled MCs in the business, but this is no more apparent here than on their prior works. For the amount of talent ?uestlove has, the beats he throws down are too often trite, with a hard snare hit inevitably falling on counts two and four. He does break it down for the people on ""You Got Me"", just as he does on the Things Fall Apart version, but such moments are too few and far between. The primary appeal of The Roots Come Alive for fanatics is the inclusion of two new studio recordings on the disc, the weaker of which also appears on the soundtrack to The Best Man. (You're about as likely to remember this Taye Diggs classic as you are to recall The Wood.) On ""The Lesson-- Part III"", however, The Roots are in top form, offering a promising vision of continued mastery on forthcoming records. Overall, though, a live album should be awfully exceptional in execution or reinvention to garner a high rating, regardless of the quality of the original tracks. As fresh as The Roots can be onstage, this performance resembles the majority of other live records on the shelves today-- it's merely average when held against the studio material.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6833-the-roots-come-alive/,MCA,1999.0
472,David Bowie,Hours,Rock,4.7,October 5 1999,Ryan Schreiber,Founder,"For a lot of kids, David Bowie is a guy that's never been even remotely cool, let alone taken seriously. Yep, they remember him for what he's contributed to society in their lifetimes-- Tin Machine, Black Tie, White Noise, the ""Cool World"" soundtrack, Outside, Earthling, and now Hours. Who'd guess that a discography that unlistenable would belong to the richest man in rock music? At this point, David Bowie has done more harm than good to his fans' cochleas. His last few albums have failed in almost every aspect, but not for a lack of trying. Outside, his 1995 ""comeback,"" was a concept album about a futuristic murder case that featured an endless stream of clichÃ©s and banal S&M; imagery in lieu of lyrics. His 1997 follow-up, Earthling, attempted mock drum-n-bass, some shoddy reggae- tinged numbers, and a universally- panned tour with Trent Reznor. Hours, of course, completes Bowie's late 90's trilogy in his usual fashion-- he's altered his sound to fit his perception of current musical trends. And as always, he's closer to getting it right than you might expect, but still way off the mark. Here, Bowie seems content to cut his losses with today's youth and reach for the older set. Hours opts for a spacy, but nonetheless adult- contemporary sound that comes across with all the vitality and energy of a rotting log. For the better part of an hour, Bowie drifts through some the most sterile and unimaginative songs since Sting released Mercury Falling. On ""Thursday's Child,"" Bowie acknowledges his issues with growing old, and possibly, his dwindling fanbase. ""Throw me tomorrow,"" he sings. ""Not that I've really got a chance."" At least he can admit it. But just six songs later, Bowie regresses into ""The Pretty Things are Going to Hell,"" an homage to his classic 1971 song ""Oh! You Pretty Things"" and Iggy and the Stooges' ""Hard to Beat (Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell)"" off Raw Power. As expected, it's not something you wanna find yourself listening to. No, it's not a new low, but that doesn't mean it's not embarrassing. David Bowie is my dad's age, whether he likes it or not, and he needs to exercise some self-restraint-- you know, like taking a deep breath when he gets the urge to pen a sequel to one of his old hits. Or counting to ten when he feels the need to put a flanger effect on the guitar track. Or returning to an old drug habit when he becomes inspired to record another album...",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/881-hours/,Virgin,1999.0
473,My Morning Jacket,The Tennessee Fire,Rock,8.0,July 13 1999,Zach Hooker,,"Little Darla is making a big deal about My Morning Jacket. Their spiel is this: My Morning Jacket is not just another ironic, derivative alt-country band. ""There ain't nothin' trendy about 'em,"" Darla proclaims. ""They're the real deal."" This is followed by some gibberish about how you'll think you're listening to some lost George Jones or Johnny Cash album, and some further hooey about how My Morning Jacket don't know anything about the ""indie"" scene, and don't care for what they do know. Bullocks. The truth of the matter is that you're not going to be hearing any of this stuff on your local Country and Western station. If you hear it on the radio at all, it's gonna be on some little college station. Y'know why? 'Cause it owes a lot more to that indie scene than Darla lets on. Yeah, the country force is strong with these guys. Sure, their country sound is not typical alt-posturing. And it's true that there's no irony in sight. But listening to The Tennessee Fire, you'll never be convinced that you're hearing anything other than what it is: country- influenced indie rock by four kids from Kentucky. There. Nothing to be ashamed of. Here's something that might tip you off to the fact that this is not classic country: big, loud, echoing drums, song titles like ""Evelyn is Not Real"" and ""I Will Be There When You Die,"" twelve feet of reverb on every last sound, and singer Jim James' vocal stylings, which often sound remarkably like another southern indie-rocker-- the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne. If you spring for a vinyl copy of the album (and you should), you'll be treated to an extra 7"" worth of mournful, simply- strummed songs laid over what sounds like some early Meat Beat Manifesto drum programming. It's good stuff, but of course, it's hardly George Jones. Still, the country vibe is undeniable. This may be the most lonesome record I've heard this year, with the aforementioned reverb making it sound like it was recorded in the dead of night at the back of a concrete drainage culvert, kudzu growing on the amps, major sevenths littering the ground like cigarette butts. These kids can harmonize, too, a talent that most alt-country bands are sadly lacking-- the album's highlight, the ghostly ""They Ran,"" features some background ooh's and ahh's that'll make you think your hi-fi's haunted-- not by Hank Williams Sr., but by the memory of some foggy morning outside of Nashville, driving home to Colorado from Atlanta, broke and nearly out of gas, when you realized something had changed irrevocably and for the worse. Not bad for a song that's ostensibly about somebody stealing the singer's lighter. Ultimately, the sooner you let go of Darla's press kit mumbo- jumbo, the sooner you can relax and enjoy an excellent album. Because, as with any other worthwhile band, country or otherwise, what makes The Tennessee Fire so great is not My Morning Jacket's ""sound,"" but their songs.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5529-the-tennessee-fire/,Darla,1999.0
